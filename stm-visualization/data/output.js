Cyprus has been divided for more than 30 years, following a 1974 invasion by Turkey. The time is ripe for resolving this longstanding split, and I applaud President Papadopoulos for taking the initiative to end the division. On February 28, 2006, President Papadopoulos met with U.N. Secretary- General Kofi Annan and proposed that the U.N. appoint a special envoy for Cyprus to lay the groundwork for negotiations to end the division of Cyprus. President Papadopoulos also proposed a number of cross- community confidence-building measures to strengthen the foundation for reunification. After the meeting, Secretary-General Annan and President Papadopoulos issued a joint statement agreeing on the resumption of bicommunal discussions on the technical aspects necessary to prepare the ground for full peace negotiations. There have been significant developments in Cyprus over the past 2 years that make this the right time for reunification. Nearly 2 years ago, Cyprus joined the European Union, and in that time, the Government of Cyprus has promoted the opening up of several crossing points through the U.N.-patrolled cease-fire line. As a result, the Government of Cyprus has transformed the everyday realities on Cyprus to that unlike any other divided nation. Unlike other divisions with which my colleagues may be familiar, such as East and West Berlin, the people of Cyprus are able to cross the dividing line to visit their ancestral lands, work, and shop. Indeed, since the opening of crossing points, there have been more than 9 million incident-free crossings. Every day, more than 10,000 Turkish Cypriots cross from the occupied territory to the government-controlled area to work. This increased economic activity and trade across the dividing line has contributed in more than doubling the per-capita income of the Turkish-Cypriots in the past 2 short years. As confidence building measures, President Papadopoulos has proposed to take additional steps to build on the gains of the past 2 years. The Government of Cyprus has already proposed the reopening of the occupied Port of Famagusta and the return of the adjacent city of Varosha to its original inhabitants; a ``ghost'' city that has been abandoned since the 1974 Turkish invasion. Famagusta would operate under the joint administration of the two communities, bringing the two communities closer together, and also under the EU's regulatory auspices, enhancing trade opportunities. President Papadopoulos has also proposed to open additional crossing points to make travel and trade between the two communities easier. Last week, the European Union announced economic aid to the Turkish Cypriots of 139 million eurodollars--approximately $165 million. The Government of Cyprus had pushed strongly for this aid, despite unfortunate attempts by others to attach preconditions and political stipulations to its release. This aid from the EU further demonstrates the positive effect of Cyprus's EU membership on the prospects for reunification. I applaud the steps that the Government of Cyprus and President Papadopoulos have taken to encourage a just and lasting solution to the Cyprus division. His meeting with Secretary-General Annan is a positive first step toward the resumption of reunification negotiations. On Cyprus today, the two communities are closer together than at any time since the invasion. Although prior reunification efforts have failed, the developments of the past 2 years offer the greatest prospect for a peaceful and lasting solution to the division.","word.count":572,"sep11":4.60674157303371,"years":2006.46629213483,"days":4082,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.00740017649846675,"Topic 2":0.00968156444010105,"Topic 3":0.00570168493818254,"Topic 4":0.0125082369939888,"Topic 5":0.00685511709994583,"Topic 6":0.0259502845361534,"Topic 7":0.602139390103631,"Topic 8":0.0405036315439119,"Topic 9":0.286024204634188,"Topic 10":0.00323570921143183},{"id":"10519980029573","body":"Frank Wolf: Mr. Speaker, I want to thank our colleague, the gentleman from Ohio for sponsoring this bill. It is with great honor I rise today in support of this legislation that would designate the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia as the George H.W. Bush Center for Central Intelligence. Renaming the CIA headquarters would be a fitting tribute to our distinguished former President. The fact is, in the early 1980s this used to be in my congressional district. I was out there at the dedication of the addition to the new building. At that time former President Bush, who was then Vice President, was out there with then President Reagan and was so warmly and well thought of by everybody at the CIA at those times. George Bush has an exceptional career in service to the American people. He triumphantly led our country to victory in the Gulf War crisis, and he paved the way for freedom and democracy in Eastern Europe as the Cold War ended and the communist empire broke up. George Bush also served our Nation in many other capacities. He has the distinction of being the only former President to be Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. George Bush is still today held in highest regard by the CIA and its employees. In fact, many times I will talk with a CIA employee or former employee, they tell me they thought George Bush was one of the best directors they ever had. When appointed Director to the CIA in 1976, he inherited a very difficult situation, but during his tenure he created strength and stability in the intelligence community, and he is widely credited for restoring morale at the CIA. Mr. Speaker, America has a proud tradition of honoring our great presidents. What better way to honor George Bush than to place his name on the CIA headquarters in Langley. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this. I thank the gentleman from Ohio for introducing the bill.","word.count":333,"sep11":-3.18820224719101,"years":1998.67134831461,"days":1307,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.255377906425058,"Topic 2":0.128032633853891,"Topic 3":0.0125315306729835,"Topic 4":0.0288799685014181,"Topic 5":0.0158136883788278,"Topic 6":0.0136860549356932,"Topic 7":0.329747614701258,"Topic 8":0.104086727634308,"Topic 9":0.090228790497478,"Topic 10":0.0216150843990842},{"id":"10519980019832","body":"Lynn Rivers: Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to speak to two issues which are very much related around this issue, which is soft money and express advocacy. Both are currently being used to deliver campaign ads by skirting campaign laws. Soft money is meant to be used for general party building. It is meant to benefit the party as a whole, not to benefit any particular candidate. Express advocacy ads are meant to speak to issues and not to expressly advocate for the election or defeat of any single candidate. Currently, both of these laws and both of these activities have huge loopholes that are being exploited shamelessly by groups across the political spectrum. Consider a real, not hypothetical, series of ads that ran this last cycle in New York. The people who ran these ads argued that publicly attacking one candidate in a race is not a benefit to the other candidate and should not be considered so. It is an interesting interpretation. $750,000 of soft money was spent to attack one candidate in a two-candidate race under the argument that this should be protected because it was, of course, not a benefit to the other candidate. Let me tell my colleagues what the express language used was. On the air, the suggestion was that candidate number one was for more taxes, for more welfare. Candidate number one would tax and spend. Candidate number one was responsible for the mess in Albany. And the ad finished up by flashing the telephone number of the candidate and urging viewers to call and tell this candidate to cut taxes, not take another bite out of our paychecks. Now, my understanding is that when these ads aired, there were no tax votes imminent in the assembly where that candidate was serving. There was no specific issue that was mentioned. The only message that one can glean from this particular ad was the one that was meant to be gleaned, which is to turn public opinion against the featured candidate, and $750,000 of soft money was used to air these ads. The reforms embodied in Shays-Meehan are meant to shut down these sort of semantic shenanigans. Changes are needed because parties and organizations on both sides of the political aisle are currently abusing the system. My belief is that those who are pursuing real issue advocacy should have no problem doing so in a system reformed by Shays- Meehan. This is just another alarmist argument meant to frighten Members away from the reforms that our constituents want.","word.count":433,"sep11":-3.31460674157303,"years":1998.54494382022,"days":1262,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0693896180180408,"Topic 2":0.325148016026787,"Topic 3":0.0060966357079168,"Topic 4":0.00604761067403055,"Topic 5":0.533036850565137,"Topic 6":0.00421456224618499,"Topic 7":0.00318072444722258,"Topic 8":0.0355328742136499,"Topic 9":0.00626125773478294,"Topic 10":0.0110918503662463},{"id":"10720010073141","body":"Kit Bond: Mr. President, it is very important that we debate and understand where we are going on the stimulus package. I agree with what many people have said: We do need an economic stimulus. We have been in a recession for 15, 16 months. September 11 has pushed us down even further. The economists may say we have to wait until we have two successive quarters of negative growth, but everybody knows the economy has been going downhill. I also agree that what we need to do needs to be immediate, needs to be stimulative, and should not be permanent; it should be temporary. I have a great deal of problems with what has been produced by the House and what has been produced by the Finance Committee. A newspaper that is common to the area the occupant of the chair and I serve--I often don't agree with it--had an editorial today referring to one part of the Senate Finance Committee bill and talked about chicken manure and applied that appellation to both bills, the one that came out of the House and one that came out of the Finance Committee. I wouldn't go so far myself as to say that. I would say, as we say back home, I have a minimum amount of high enthusiasm for either one of those bills. Now, on either one of them, one can say these are needed things. Any bill that provides for research in science and building infrastructure, things normally in the course of appropriations, I would support. We need to build highways. We need to do research. There are a lot of problems with which we need to pick up. Similarly, when you are talking about tax relief and tax cuts, the long-term good of the economy requires that we lower marginal tax rates and get rid of the craziness that the alternative minimum tax imposes, particularly on individuals and small businesses. But I don't think this is the time to do it. I think we need to take care of those people who are hurting. That is why I think we ought to provide something that has unemployment compensation and grants to the States to help with health care. I also believe we need to help small business. I have filed a couple of amendments that do several things for small business. Frankly, small business was largely left out of the Senate Finance Committee and the House bills. Small business is the driving engine of our economy, and nobody seemed to care about small business. They are the ones taking it in the teeth in many areas. So I filed amendments that do several things. First, my amendment provides for much more generous loan terms for small businesses that have been directly or indirectly affected by the September 11 terrorist attacks, by deferring and/or forgiving interest on these loans and lowering fees. In other words, it says to small business that if you are willing to take the chance now to invest and grow your business as this economy starts to turn around, we are going to give you a break on the amount you have to pay up front. You can defer paying interest until we come out of this. That makes a lot of sense. I think, also, we need to encourage and ensure that small business gets a share of Government procurement as part of these stimulus packages. We pass small business bills that give all kinds of benefits to small business and then the bureaucrats find ways around them. We need to tighten up and eliminate those loopholes so when the Federal Government spends money, a part of that money goes to small businesses for the purchase of goods or services. On the tax front, if there is one thing we can do to help small business it is to raise the amount of new equipment that they can expense. Today, if a small business owner buys a piece of equipment, he can expense up to $24,000 of the purchase price. My proposal is to increase that limit to $50,000 that can be written off immediately so they can get an immediate tax break and don't have to depreciate it. We would also raise the limit on vehicles. Right now, you can only depreciate about $14,000 on vehicles. A lot of vehicles--particularly vans and trucks used by small business--cost well above that amount and they can't depreciate the full cost of the vehicle. So it is a real burden on small business to buy them. For restaurants, which are dominated by small businesses, we ought to restore the full 100-percent business meal deduction. These are things we can do on an immediate basis that will have an immediate impact on small businesses, their suppliers, equipment manufacturers, and our economy as a whole. I also happen to favor one of the simplest, most direct approaches to get money into the pockets of working men and women who can spend it right away. Senator Domenici has developed a concept of having a December tax holiday on FICA, the Social Security payments all working Americans make each year. Under this proposal, any payments that are owed during December by employees or employers would not be sent in, leaving more in each worker's pay check and more for the business to protect jobs. The General Treasury would reimburse the Social Security fund so there would be no loss to Social Security Trust Fund while protecting retirees' benefits. This is one way we could get money into the pockets of people who will spend it in December. One of the things people are talking about is the expansion of the tax rebates that started in July. The rebate the President suggested is fine, but most people say it is unworkable because you can't get the rebate out until January and there's a good chance it will slow down the processing of returns and mailing of refunds in the upcoming tax filing season. I think everybody realizes that to get a strong economy we need the money in the pockets of the working men and women in America now, not tomorrow. So I would like to see a serious consideration to the December FICA tax holiday that Senator Domenici has constructed. I have several more amendments at the desk. If we are going to be here and have a vote-a-rama on a long list of amendments, you can count me in because I think these things ought to be considered. I believe there is also discussion, on the other hand, by the leadership that if the point of order is sustained, there will be serious negotiations so that a final package will come to the floor. Obviously, that is not in my hands. But I raise these points about small business and the need to stimulate the small business sector of our economy, which would be helped by easier loans, greater expensing, more Government contracts, and which would be helped by the plan that Senator Domenici has conceived. I hope when he introduces it, he will add me as a cosponsor. These things will help. I think they will give the kind of economic stimulus we need right away, and if there is to be a negotiated agreement--House-Senate, Republican-Democrat, and the White House--I hope they will take into account these vitally important provisions for small business, and perhaps avoid the paths that will be best addressed in other legislative action at other times. I urge the managers of the bill to consider the impact this stimulus package can and must have on small business.","word.count":1272,"sep11":0.179775280898876,"years":2002.0393258427,"days":2506,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.783025634377994,"Topic 2":0.0358100954203096,"Topic 3":0.00921238276475805,"Topic 4":0.029280442957762,"Topic 5":0.00664596675572457,"Topic 6":0.0103039465021537,"Topic 7":0.0739383414753367,"Topic 8":0.0255044104111716,"Topic 9":0.0220663810013251,"Topic 10":0.00421239833346442},{"id":"10519970082797","body":"Frank Murkowski: Mr. President, I have been to Puerto Rico.

Essentially this legislation does two things: it expands and reforms the work opportunity tax credit, a hiring incentive to give those on welfare an opportunity to go to work. Yesterday, I stood with President Bush in Chicago at the United Parcel Service facility where he highlighted this very program which has provided opportunities for thousands and thousands of Chicago residents to go from welfare to work; and clearly the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, which was a creation of Ronald Reagan, is one of those provisions which is working as we see our Nation's welfare rolls cut in half and 9 million Americans move from welfare to work. The other key part of the Encouraging Work and Supporting Marriage Act of 2002 is legislation which much more quickly phases in the marriage tax relief provisions which are part of what we nicknamed the Bush tax cut signed into law last year. Over the last several years, I have had the opportunity to come to this floor and talk about the unfairness of our complicated Tax Code and how our current Tax Code historically has punished marriage, a very basic institution in our society. In fact, I believe the most important institution in our society is marriage. Unfortunately, up until President Bush's signature signing the Bush tax cut into law, our Tax Code punished marriage. Let me give an example of what the marriage tax penalty is and was. Under our Tax Code prior to the Bush tax cut, 43 million married working couples paid on average $1,700 more in higher taxes just because they were married. I do not believe that is right; I do not believe that is fair. And I am proud to say that House Republicans made it a priority to work with the President to eliminate the marriage tax penalty. I would also note what creates the marriage tax penalty is married couples file their taxes jointly. A single person files single and married couples file jointly, which means there is a combined income. If there are two incomes, that pushes the couple into a higher tax bracket and in most cases creates the marriage tax penalty. I have a couple here from my district I would like to introduce, Jose and Magdalena Castillo from Joliet, Illinois. They are both in the workforce. They have a son, Eduardo, as well as a daughter, Carolina. They paid about $1,200 in higher taxes just because they are married prior to the Bush tax cut. I think it is wrong. Thanks to the Bush tax cut, Jose and Magdalena Castillo of Joliet, Illinois, saw their marriage tax penalty eliminated. Of course, we are going to have legislation this week which is going to help low- and moderate-income married couples. It will more quickly phase in so married couples in the low- and moderate-income range will see much quicker marriage tax relief. But I would also note, unfortunately because of the arcane rules of Congress, not of the House but of the other body, that the Bush tax cut was forced to be temporary which means it expires at a certain point; and the 100 million American taxpayers who have seen their taxes lowered, which is everybody who pays income taxes has seen their income taxes lowered, and 3.9 million families with children have been totally removed from the income tax rolls, which means thanks to the Bush tax cut, they no longer pay income taxes, they will see those taxes reimposed unless we make permanent the Bush tax cut. Now for couples like Jose and Magdalena Castillo of Joliet, Illinois, they are going to see their marriage tax penalty reimposed; and they will be suffering it once again unless we make the Bush tax cut permanent. I am proud to say that this House under the leadership of the gentleman from Illinois and the gentleman from California , the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means, and the persistence and convictions of the House Republican majority, we have voted in the House to make the Bush tax cut permanent because we do not want to see couples such as Jose and Magdalena Castillo of Joliet, Illinois, have to pay that marriage tax penalty again. It is wrong; it is unfair. And it is wrong that under our Tax Code, married couples paid higher taxes just because they are married. My hope is before the end of this year that we will be able to obtain bipartisan support in both the House and Senate for adoption of a permanency for the Bush tax cut, for marriage tax penalty relief, for elimination of the death tax, for across-the-board rate reductions, for retirement savings as well as the opportunities to save for college education. Those are good things; but unfortunately, they are temporary. Unless we make the Bush tax cut permanent, all of those things, marriage tax penalty relief, death tax repeal, retirement savings opportunities by increased contributions to IRAs and 401s, an opportunity to see taxes lowered overall because of rate reductions for everyone, those taxes are going to go back up. Let us make the Bush tax cut permanent. Let us help couples such as Jose and Magdalena Castillo see their marriage tax penalty eliminated permanently. Let us get the Senate and the House to make the Bush tax cut permanent.","word.count":1245,"sep11":-0.311797752808989,"years":2001.54775280899,"days":2331,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.854901915543067,"Topic 2":0.0505810498077901,"Topic 3":0.00994401702330277,"Topic 4":0.0233678689343687,"Topic 5":0.0104626879195712,"Topic 6":0.0101512303739249,"Topic 7":0.0082032502737651,"Topic 8":0.0172309492340985,"Topic 9":0.0107074974169159,"Topic 10":0.00444953347319537},{"id":"10820030001160","body":"Max Sandlin: Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment","word.count":536,"sep11":1.43820224719101,"years":2003.29775280899,"days":2954,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0333330051343275,"Topic 2":0.107408474650282,"Topic 3":0.00400103116621812,"Topic 4":0.66028267974182,"Topic 5":0.00238389861506379,"Topic 6":0.00248326170555442,"Topic 7":0.0556160967957802,"Topic 8":0.00395052313344859,"Topic 9":0.128076405565542,"Topic 10":0.00246462349196306},{"id":"10619990088375","body":"Robert Byrd: Yes.

That is what this looks like on a chart: 29,700 pension plans in force, 17,800 of them to be frozen under the 60 percent proposal. The administration has not considered it. That is why the motion to recommit is so important. We say that fully funded pension plans should not face dramatically severe additional funding requirements, they are already fully funded. Why would you want to punish employers who have funded pension plans? One very clear reason: to end pensions. And that is really what is at stake. They want to move from a defined benefit pension guarantee to defined contribution 401s. It is as simple as that. We should resist that. Pensions ensure that the risk of participating is universal. The workers participate. They ensure that the risk of investing is handled collectively. They ensure that you are not going to outlive your assets in retirement. That is what pensions provide. That is why we should be able to agree on a bipartisan basis to continue these pensions. But yet just last week at the Nation's Savers Summit, I heard a committee chairman say he prefers the 401 to pensions. Why, he was asked? Because it is part of the ownership society. Oh, we get it. You own your risk. You own your risk of investing appropriately. And you own the risk that you are not going to outlive the assets as you live on to retirement years. We ought to be doing everything we can to keep workers' pensions. We all ought to feel some failure when we read, like today's headlines, GM to cut retirement costs, following, as the article notes, not just troubled companies, but healthy as well. Verizon, IBM, Motorola, the trend continues and will be accelerated dramatically by this bill which seeks to push all of the Nation's pension plans into termination in favor of 401s. Pass this motion to recommit.","word.count":963,"sep11":3.56179775280899,"years":2005.42134831461,"days":3710,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.350334370592706,"Topic 2":0.234069010335475,"Topic 3":0.040594130944581,"Topic 4":0.0516336841534625,"Topic 5":0.0330414696208222,"Topic 6":0.131420368025291,"Topic 7":0.12471723136434,"Topic 8":0.0252301482188505,"Topic 9":0.00584321188578149,"Topic 10":0.00311637485868988},{"id":"10419950060206","body":"Donald A.

That is not only for commercial lines of insurance, which would be businesses such as shopping centers and office buildings, but it could also affect homeowners and automobile owners. Since September 11, businesses and consumers have suffered great economic losses, and we are reading about those repercussions every day. So I would like to address this very sensitive topic as we come into the closing days of this session. The insurance industry is now saying the clock is running out for those businesses that want terrorism insurance because 70 percent of reinsurance policies--that is, insurance on insurance, or, in industry terminology, reinsurance--70 percent of those reinsurance policies expire after December 31, and many insurance companies are threatening to cancel policies or to exclude terrorism coverage. We simply can't let that happen. Congress must act to make sure that insurance is available and affordable. It is the responsible thing to do. The problem is that there are so many different ideas on how to do it. I served for six years as Florida's elected Insurance Commissioner and State Treasurer. During that time, we experienced a major catastrophe--Hurricane Andrew. This natural disaster, with insurance losses totaling $16 billion, proved to be the most costliest in the history of this country. The private market was so paralyzed from this event that nurturing it back to life proved extremely daunting. Insurance companies were not offering new home owners policies; to the contrary, they were trying to flee the State of Florida and were cancelling policies for those who remained in the State of Florida. Fortunately, by establishing a private pooling mechanism, and carefully monitoring rate increases, we were able to reinvigorate and stabilize the market. Accordingly, in the waning days of this session, I would like to offer some of my experience as guidance as we proceed. Let me give you an example of what is happening just to set the stage as to how serious this is right now. The ISO, the Insurance Services Organization, which files policy provisions for many insurers, has announced that it is asking for terrorism exclusions in insurance policies across the nation. That should be the first warning sign. But there are other warning signs. For example, I will read from the Chicago Tribune of October 28. Listen to this: That is the Chicago Tribune. Then listen to a report that was sent out by Lloyd's of London. I quote from the investor newsletter of Lloyd's of London, That newsletter added that premiums were at ``a level where very large profits are possible.'' If there is any doubt about some of the shock to the system right now because of what is happening with rate increases, let me point out that the Wall Street Journal reported that insurance companies are already raising premiums by 100 percent or more on some lines of commercial insurance coverage. These accounts were presented by the Consumer Federation of America's insurance expert, Bob Hunter, at a press conference earlier today. Bob Hunter also talked about a big reinsurance company, one of the giants in Germany, named Alliance. Alliance has announced increases of 20 to 50 percent, and in some cases increases may reach 200 percent. Another example hits close to home for all of our Senators in the Northeast corridor: It is reported that the cost of insuring Giants Stadium in New Jersey's Meadow Lands for terrorism is now being increased from $700,000 to $3.5 million. That is a fivefold increase. That is a 500-percent increase. If that were not enough, the CEO of Zurich Financial Services, which is another one of the major giants from Europe which does business through subsidiaries here in the United States, told a gathering of insurers, on November 27, with respect to the terrorist attacks of September 11: What we saw in Florida with insurance rate increases after Hurricane Andrew seems to be occurring again this time on a national scale with huge increases in commercial insurance rates. That is why we must act. I understand that there are all kinds barriers to progress on this issue--people are trying to rewrite the tort laws of this country and thus you have a fight that has gone on almost as long as the Republic on this issue. If this continues, it is possible that we will not be able to pass anything in the next week. I am trying to understand what would be the consequence. Will the market respond? But I don't think that is the responsible thing. I think the responsible thing for us to do is enact a piece of legislation and get it signed into law. But I want to say to my colleagues that from all of my experience with insurance, as we deal with terrorism insurance we must be ever- mindful of consumer safeguards: Therefore, any bill that we would enact must have three fundamental protections for the consumer. I think the bill has to have three protections for consumers: No. 1, commercial insurers must offer coverage for the risk of terrorism on all policies. In other words, an insurance company could not clearly say they will cover your little two-story office building but not cover your 20-story office building. They cannot cherry-pick. There has to be mandatory coverage for all on terrorism risk. No. 2, the insurance company cannot cancel the terrorism insurance unless it is in the normal course of business, such as somebody did not pay their premiums. And No. 3, because we not only have to make terrorism insurance available, we have to make it affordable. Commercial consumers cannot afford these kinds of price increases. They cannot afford a 500-percent increase. They cannot afford a 200- percent increase. They cannot afford what Lloyds of London was saying was an 80-percent increase, particularly not if the legislation we pass here is going to have the Federal Government picking up most of the terrorism risk. So I clearly advise all my colleagues in the Senate, the third protection is that there has to be a reasonable amount of rate increase, and what it can be has to be limited. I have suggested it be in the range of about 3 percent, which would produce an additional $6 billion of premium, and that the $6 billion of premium associated with the terrorism risk not being mixed with all the other premiums like on fire and theft. Our legislation should require insurers to specify the price for terrorism coverage as a separate line item on the policy. If we do not carefully monitor proposed rate increases, the insurance companies are going to file whatever they want in an increase with 50 State insurance departments. Then those insurance commissioners, who are trying to do a good job, are going to put their actuaries to work to see if this is a reasonable filing. How do they determine if it is reasonable and not excessive and nondiscriminatory, which is usually the statutory standard for reviewing a rate increase? They have to have data and they have to have experience. We do not have any of that in our 50 State insurance departments. Thus, what will happen is, whatever the rate hike is that is filed, the insurance departments of the 50 States will not be able to say that it is excessive, and they will not be able to prevail in a court of law or in an administrative court of law. As a result, the practical effect will be that the insurance rate hike that is filed will, in fact, be in effect. And it would be 2 or 3 years before you could ever start to overturn it. What is worse, there are 10 States whose law says that an insurance company cannot file a rate until it is approved by the insurance commissioner. The legislation that is being contemplated to be passed in this body would say, this Federal legislation will supersede the State law, so that, in effect, the rate hike takes effect immediately even though the State law says, in those 10 States, that the insurance commissioner has to approve it first. That is a pretty high-stakes ball game. We simply cannot afford for this to go on. So what I am going to continue to urge, as I have privately--this is my first public statement on this, save for an interview I had last week with the Washington Post and save for the testimony I gave to the Banking Committee and as a member of the Commerce Committee when I had the opportunity to express my thoughts there--but so much more is known now as to see what is starting to happen in these last few days of this session. This is what we are confronting. Simply, if we do not watch it, we are going to allow to pass through this Chamber, and be accepted by the House, a piece of legislation that, in order to take care of the problem of the lack of terrorism insurance, will then allow the rates to go sky-high, rates, I submit respectfully to all of my colleagues, that will not be able to be affordable, particularly by homeowners and by automobile owners. Even though the bills being contemplated say this is primarily for commercial insurance, they also say, at the option of the insurance company, for personal lines of insurance, such as for automobiles and homes, they can opt into it. What homeowners' insurance company, if it has homes, for example, in the neighborhood of a nuclear power plant, is not going to opt in to this kind of protection? So what I am saying is, you better watch out. We are about to vote for something that is about to mandate huge rate hikes. The Senate and the House of Representatives do not normally handle this stuff because ever since the 1940s in the McCarren-Ferguson Act, we transferred that ability to regulate insurance to the 50 States. Thus, we are not familiar with the facts of rate-making and the experience and data a","word.count":2307,"sep11":0.23876404494382,"years":2002.09831460674,"days":2527,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0902253947656107,"Topic 2":0.337919632580777,"Topic 3":0.00773894123622446,"Topic 4":0.0268856244756118,"Topic 5":0.0228677011844701,"Topic 6":0.00518621005417561,"Topic 7":0.00627072014750498,"Topic 8":0.348946330826031,"Topic 9":0.0320039713013564,"Topic 10":0.121955473428238},{"id":"10820030090436","body":"Tom Harkin: Mr. President, I had some calls like that, too, from labor groups and building trades on the overtime issue.

It cannot be done. I rise this afternoon to support H.R. 125. It is about time we set the record straight on the gun ban debate. The misinformation campaign waged by antigun groups and echoed in the media has intentionally distorted the issue. What is an assault weapon? Just as in the general public, I am sure there are Members in this House who cannot distinguish between a fully automatic weapon and a semiautomatic weapon. The firearms banned by last session's legislation are ugly, but I have run across some very nice people in the world who are not so pretty. What a firearm looks like has nothing to do with how a firearm functions. When the media talks about the need to ban semiautomatic firearms, they hold up and point to fully automatic weapons like the much-publicized Uzi and AK- 47s and other automatic weapons, which have been illegal for more than 40 years. As the bill's language states, banning specific types of firearms has no effect on the behavior of those who commit violent crimes with firearms. The only sure way to keep gun-wielding violent criminals off the streets is to put them away in prison for a long, long time. This legislation provides a real solution. It gets tough on criminals who use a firearm in violent criminal acts. Under this bill, convicted armed criminals will be sentenced to a minimum of 5 years in prison and not less than 20 years for a second offense. A person who discharges a firearm while committing a violent crime must be sentenced to a minimum of 20 years in prison and not less than 30 years for a second offense. If we can put criminals away and keep them away, we will reduce crime. Law-abiding gunowners want these criminals off the streets. They do not care whether they are using a gun, a knife, or a baseball bat. We must have swift, sure justice. We cannot continue to ask law-abiding Americans to forgo their constitutional right to own a firearm. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to protect rights of law-abiding gunowners.

The goal was to build a bridge between Wall Street and our untapped markets in Main Street America. In that same year, Senators Paul Wellstone, Jeff Bingaman, Paul Sarbanes, Carl Levin, Max Cleland, and I introduced the Community Development and Venture Capital Act to spearhead this innovative New Markets initiative in the Senate. In 2000, our New Markets initiative was enacted with bipartisan support in Congress as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001. The New Markets Venture Capital Program, NMVC, which specifically promotes the creation of wealth and job opportunities in low-income areas, was only one part of the initiative agreed to by Speaker Hastert and then-President Clinton. The other elements of that agreement included the New Markets Tax Credits, NMTC, additional empowerment zones, and a new program: Community Renewal Zones. The overall goal of the legislation was to provide a number of different approaches to alleviating poverty so that we could better understand what works best. With the exception of the NMVC Program, all of the other programs have moved forward. However, the NMVC Program has not been given the opportunity, the funding, or the support to reach its full potential as Congress intended. The NMVC Program has had many successes since its inception 5 years ago. CEI Community Ventures, Inc. from Maine--close to my home State of Massachusetts--has invested venture capital funds in Look's Gourmet Food Company, which manufactures and sells all-natural, high-quality, shelf-stable seafood products under the ``Bar Harbor T'' and ``Atlantic T'' brands. Another example can be found in Vermont, where Carolyn Cooke and Poppy Gall founded Juno Rising/Isis Women's Apparel, an outdoor clothing company targeting the needs of today's active women. Their products can be found in outdoor stores throughout the country. Today, I rise to introduce legislation that will not only reauthorize the New Markets Venture Capital Program for 3 years, but will provide critical components for success: providing appropriate funding authorization levels, expanding the NMVC program into all regions of the country, encouraging investment in small manufacturers, making the NMVC Program consistent with the NMTC as Congress intended, incorporating the operational assistance grant model from the Rural Business Investment Program, and establishing a long-overdue Office of New Markets Venture Capital. The legislation is a companion to H.R. 4303, introduced by Representatives Gwen Moore of Wisconsin and Hal Rogers of Kentucky. While few differences exist between our bills, both send a clear legislative signal that there is strong bipartisan and bicameral support from Congress to reauthorize this program. Mr. President, this program has a history of strong bipartisan support. In fiscal year 2001, together we appropriated $150 million for debenture guarantees and $30 million in grant financing to support up to 15 NMVC companies. Unfortunately, only half of this money was obligated to support 6 NMVC companies, and the remaining funds were rescinded in the Fiscal Year 2003 Omnibus Appropriations Act Conference Report. Now today this program faces further challenges with the President's Fiscal Year 2007 budget request asking for no funding for the NMVC Program. This is the sixth year in a row the President has not backed this program, although Congress restored funding in 2002 and initially provided funding in 2003. The Small Business Administration's, SBA's, failure to obligate the remaining funds and the President's lack of support for funding the NMVC Program raises an important question: Has the challenge in the 21st century of improving local economies in low-income urban and rural communities been met? All evidence says no. A 2006 report on America's Children by the Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics stated that in 2004, 17 percent of children live in poverty--a total of 12.5 million. In addition, 42 percent of children with single mothers and one in three African-American children live in poverty. The Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that in areas such as Flint, MI, where the NMVC has not yet had the time or resources to reach, the unemployment rate is at 7.3 percent, well above the national average of 4.6 percent. Congress must use this reauthorization process as an opportunity to stimulate business activity in all communities and create jobs for low-income residents throughout the entire country. Prior to the creation of the NMVC Program, Congress attempted to fill this unmet need through various programs. In fact, Congress created the NMVC Program based on the SBA's Small Business Investment Company Program, SBIC. Since its beginning in 1958, the SBIC Program has provided approximately $46 billion of long-term debt and equity capital to more than 99,000 small U.S. companies. Although the SBIC Program has been popular, it does not sufficiently reach the underserved areas of our country that need economic development the most. The NMVC is targeted specifically to very low-income areas, including historically underutilized business zones--HUB Zones--and low-income rural and urban neighborhoods, which are overlooked by traditional venture capital investors. I do not have an NMVC Company in my State, and I am sure that many Sates, like Massachusetts, could benefit from the opportunities that the NMVC creates. To ensure that the NMVC Program expands into diverse areas around the country, the legislation encourages the SBA Administrator to establish not fewer than one company from each of the 10 geographic regions of the country. In addition to diversifying the geographic distribution of NMVC companies to our underserved communities, there is a great need to diversify the types of investments approved by the SBA, particularly in the area of manufacturing. According to a 2004 study by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the most recent recession in the business cycle hit U.S. manufacturers and their workers hardest--a downturn that first was felt in 2000. The manufacturing community lost 2.6 million jobs, accounting for all of the net job losses from the fourth quarter of 2000 through the third quarter of 2003. Much of the manufacturing sector continues to operate well below its previous peak and potential. For example, in places such as Milwaukee, where in 2002, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 59 percent of working-age African-American males were either unemployed or out of the workforce. Milwaukee has also lost 33,000 manufacturing jobs in the past 5 years. We need to do all we can to bring back these lost manufacturing jobs, and the NMVC Program could play a role. Relying on the market to bring venture capital funding to Milwaukee and other manufacturing hubs is not the solution. According to a study by the University of Kansas, Milwaukee ranks 49th out of the 50 largest U.S. cities in terms of venture capital dollars. Imagine the difference that a venture capital investment could make in this area, creating one job for every $15,000 invested. As I mentioned previously, this legislation is a companion to the bipartisan legislation introduced by Representatives Moore and Rogers in the House. Both of our bills include small manufacturers in the mission of the program, by encouraging the SBA Administrator to select at least one NMVC company that is primarily involved in the investment and development of small manufacturing firms. Mr. President, the legislation also makes the NMVC Program and the NMTC consistent in defining low-income geographic areas. Both programs were designed to work together--the NMTC was intended to be a tool to encourage NMVC companies to raise private investment capital in low- income communities. Conforming their definitions will assure a smooth coordination between the two programs for future investors. The nexus between the NMVC Program and the NMTC is only one aspect that makes this program unique among all of the SBA's programs. Another unique aspect is the operational assistance grant program that fund managers can use to assist entrepreneurs in low-income communities to develop a business plan, manage employees, or market their products and services. These grants are an essential tool for fostering community development using venture capital firms because investors are able to reach out into communities not served by conventional investors. Many of the NMVC companies are also members of the surrounding community, therefore, they will have the local expertise and guidance for entrepreneurs to start and sustain a viable business. Some NMVC companies are having a difficult time meeting the SBA requirement that each company raise an upfront dollar-for-dollar match in order to obtain an operational assistance grant. To avoid this unnecessary burden, the legislation incorporates a provision modeled after the joint SBA/Department of Agriculture Rural Business Investment Program which does not require a match from the company and limits the amount of the grant. Mr. President, these improvements to the NMVC Program are important but they cannot be implemented without dedicated staff at the SBA. In October 2005, I wrote a letter to the SBA expressing my concern about the lack of staffing and resources devoted to the NMVC office within the SBA's Investment Division. The SBA informed me that staff members within the Office of SBIC Operations were getting cross-trained on the NMVC Program to ensure adequate staffing and provide ample support to meet the needs of the six NMVC companies currently assigned to the Office of New Markets Venture Capital within the","word.count":1765,"sep11":4.9747191011236,"years":2006.83426966292,"days":4213,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0558000023388485,"Topic 2":0.0410093477430366,"Topic 3":0.0144541432859957,"Topic 4":0.00649830664934094,"Topic 5":0.0408484146558387,"Topic 6":0.082020091751845,"Topic 7":0.00732109568995184,"Topic 8":0.605946299835226,"Topic 9":0.109396936121591,"Topic 10":0.0367053619283253},{"id":"10720010038415","body":"Edward Kennedy: WYDEN. Mr. President, One of the Senate's most popular procedures cannot be found anywhere in the United States Constitution or in the Senate Rules. It is one of the most powerful weapons that any Senator can wield in this body. And it is even more potent when it is invisible. The procedure is popularly known as the ``hold.'' The ``hold'' in the Senate is a lot like the seventh inning stretch in baseball: there is no official rule or regulation that talks about it, but it is has been observed for so long that it has become a tradition. The resolution that Senator Grassley and submit today does not in any way limit the privilege of any Senator to place a ``hold'' on a measure or matter. Our resolution targets the stealth cousin of the ``hold,'' known as the ``secret hold.'' It is the anonymous hold that is so odious to the basic premise of our democratic system: that the exercise of power always should be accompanied by public accountability. Our resolution would bring the anonymous hold out of the shadows of the Senate. Senator Grassley and I have championed this idea in a bipartisan manner for six years now. In 1997 and again in 1998, the United States Senate voted unanimously in favor of our amendments to require that a notice of intent to object be published in the Congressional Record within 48 hours. The amendments, however, never survived conference. So we took our case directly to the leadership, and to their credit, Tom Daschle and Trent Lott agreed it was time to make a change. They recognized the significant need for more openness in the way the United States Senate conducts its business so Tom Daschle and Trent Lott sent a joint letter in February 1999 to all Senators setting forth a policy requiring ``all Senators wishing to place a hold on any legislation or executive calender business [to] notify the sponsor of the legislation and the committee of jurisdiction of their concerns.'' The letter said that ``written notification should be provided to the respective Leader stating their intentions regarding the bill or nomination,'' and that ``holds placed on items by a member of a personal or committee staff will not be honored unless accompanied by a written notification from the objecting Senator by the end of the following business day.'' At first, this action by the Leaders seemed to make a real difference. Many Senators were more open about their holds, and staff could no longer slap a hold on a bill with a quick phone call. But after six to eight months, the Senate began to slip back towards the old ways. Abuses of the ``holds'' policy began to proliferate, staff- initiated holds-by-phone began anew, and it wasn't too long before legislative gridlock set in and the Senate seemed to have forgotten what Senators Daschle and Lott had tried to do. My own assessment of the situation now, which is not based on any scientific evidence, GAO investigation or CRS study, is that a significant number of our colleagues in the Senate have gotten the message sent by the Leaders, and have refrained from the use of secret holds. They inform sponsors about their objections, and do not allow their staff to place a hold without their approval. My sense is that the legislative gridlock generated by secret holds may be attributed to a relatively small number of abusers. The resolution we are submitting today will not be disruptive for a solid number of Senators, but it will up the ante on those who may be ``chronic abusers'' of the Leaders' policy on holds. Our bipartisan resolution would amend the Standing Rules of the Senate to require that a Senator who notifies his or her leadership of an intent to object shall disclose that objection in the Congressional Record not later than two session days after the date of the notice. The resolution would assure that the awesome power possessed by an individual Senator to stop legislation or a nomination should be accompanied by public accountability. The requirement for public notice of a hold two days after the intent has been conveyed to the leadership may prove to be an inconvenience but not a hardship. No Senator will ever be thrown in jail for failing to give public notice of a hold. Senators routinely place statements in the Congressional Record recognizing the achievements of a local Boys and Girls Club, or congratulating a local sports team on a State championship. Surely the intent of a Senator to block the progress of legislation or a nomination should be considered of equal importance. I have adhered to a policy of publicly announcing my intent to object to a measure or matter. This practice has not been a burden or inconvenience. On the contrary, my experience with the public disclosure of holds is that my objections are usually dealt with in an expeditious manner, thereby enabling the Senate to proceed with its business. Although the Senate is still several months away from the high season of secret holds, a number of important pieces of legislation have already become bogged down in the swamp of secret holds this year. The day is not far off when any given Senator may be forced to place holds on numerous other pieces of legislation or nominees just to try to ``smoke out'' the anonymous objector. The practice of anonymous multiple or rolling holds is more akin to legislative guerilla warfare than to the way the Senate should conduct its business. It is time to drain the swamp of secret holds. The resolution we submit today will be referred to the Senate Committee on Rules. It is my hope that the Committee will take this resolution seriously, hold public hearings on it and give it a thorough vetting. This is one of the most awesome powers held by anyone in American government. It has been used countless times to stall and strangle legislation. It is time to bring accountability to the procedure and to the American people.&lt;bullet&gt;","word.count":734,"sep11":-0.553370786516854,"years":2001.30617977528,"days":2245,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.00697096630762086,"Topic 2":0.196437584008731,"Topic 3":0.00251920014124216,"Topic 4":0.00468421693274596,"Topic 5":0.00337991936164676,"Topic 6":0.00219639005953623,"Topic 7":0.00617195972117686,"Topic 8":0.00394771424181717,"Topic 9":0.770447357447676,"Topic 10":0.00324469177780661},{"id":"10820040002337","body":"Jerrold Nadler: Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Iowa just hit the nail on the head. He said the purpose of this bill is to recognize that there are two victims, two people involved in this. That is exactly the point of this bill, and that is exactly why we should not pass this bill without the Lofgren substitute. I am glad the previous speaker and some of the other speakers on the other side stripped away the false rhetoric on this bill. This bill is not about punishing an assault on a fetus separately; the substitute as well as the bill does that. This is not about giving it an additional punishment; the substitute as well as the bill does that. This is about saying that there are two victims, not one victim; that the fetus or the embryo or the zygote, depending on the status of the pregnancy, is a separate legal person. That is the point of the bill. That is why we must have the substitute, why we cannot agree to the bill, because the whole point of the bill is to establish legally separate fetal personhood, which would undermine the entire rationale of Roe v. Wade and undermine a woman's right to choose, because if a fetus is a separate legal person, how can she choose to terminate the pregnancy? This is revolutionary notion going way back to Biblical law. If we look at the original Five Books of Moses, it says very plainly if you assault a woman and she dies, you should be put to death. And if you assault a woman and she miscarries, you shall pay her monetary compensation. In other words, by killing the fetus, you have damaged an interest of the woman for which she is due compensation, but you have not committed murder as you have if you kill the born person, the woman. So we have never in our history recognized a fetus as a separate legal person. The Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade specifically says we have never recognized a fetus as a separate person. If we were to do so, then we would get into the 14th amendment question that you cannot deprive a person of life, or liberty or process, without due process of law; and that is the purpose of this bill. That is the purpose of similar bills in the State legislatures, I suspect, to give underpinning to a future Supreme Court majority to say that we recognize a fetus as a person within the meaning of the 14th amendment and, therefore, abortion is murder and, therefore, Roe v. Wade is overruled and, therefore, States have no right to legalize murder and you would need a constitutional amendment to permit abortions in this country. That is the real point of this bill. And strip away all the disingenuous rhetoric about everything else, because everything else we agree on. We agree that there ought to be an additional penalty if you harm the fetus when you assault a woman. We agree that it should be a separate additional crime. The only question here between the bill and the substitute is should the separate additional crime for harming the fetus be a crime against the woman as we say, an additional separate crime against a woman deserving an additional separate penalty? Or should it be an additional crime against a second person, the fetus being recognized as a person? That is the issue in this bill and this substitute. To say that it is not and to quarry the abortion debate is quite simply disingenuous. That is why the bill was introduced. That is why they are pushing it. It is why we are opposing it.

In a proclamation to the island residents, the commander of the U.S. forces, General Nelson A. Miles, declared, ``We have not come to make war upon the people of a country that for centuries has been oppressed but, on the contrary, to bring you protection, not only to yourselves but to your property, to promote your prosperity, and to bestow upon you the immunities and blessings of the liberal institutions of our government.'' Taking General Miles at his word, the people of Puerto Rico sought immediately to make the promise of those immunities and blessings a reality. We were disappointed when the Foraker Act of 1900 defined the territorial relationship with the United States, and our frustration continues unabated. We have now been a territory or, as many claim, a colony for 100 years; and to our country's shame, we are still disenfranchised. We are denied that most fundamental right in a democracy, the right to vote. Throughout the century, applying the trickle-down theory of democracy, Congress has only grudgingly extended democratic rights to the people of Puerto Rico. First we were granted citizenship in 1917 without the right to elect our own governor. Then, 31 years later, in 1948, we were allowed to elect our own governor, but we were not allowed to exercise our right to self-determination. I firmly believe that self-determination is one of those unalienable human rights that the Founding Fathers of this democracy held dear. It is not something that 3.8 million American citizens of Puerto Rico should have to earn or demonstrate that we deserve, though if that is the value system of this democracy, we certainly have done both by fighting and dying in this country's service and by enthusiastically and responsibly exercising our right to vote and shape our local government. What will influence Congress? What will prompt it to act, if it is not, as I would hope, the very rightfulness of Puerto Rican self- determination? The only thing I can figure out is the voters. Voters get every politician's attention. Sadly, it is not the voters of Puerto Rico that I am speaking of, because we are denied the right to vote in presidential elections and we are denied voting representation in Congress. However, the Hispanic or Latino vote will count. Hispanics are on their way to becoming the largest minority in this country. They represent 34 percent of the population in New Mexico, 25 percent of the population in California, 30 percent of the population in Texas, and 19 percent of the population in Arizona. Like the U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico, Hispanics are conscientious voters. A bipartisan poll of registered Hispanic voters commissioned by Univision Communications, Inc., revealed that 94 percent of the respondents plan to vote in this year's elections. Mark Penn, a Democrat and coauthor of the survey, with Mike Deaver, a Republican, thinks that the findings demonstrate the growing importance of Latinos in the American political process. Hispanics, he notes, provide a crucial swing vote in some of the Nation's biggest States. I am heartened by this survey's findings that 56 percent of Latinos support statehood for Puerto Rico, whereas only 27 percent do not. I am confident that a much larger percentage of Hispanics endorse Puerto Rican self-determination. Puerto Rican self-determination is becoming a telltale issue for Hispanics, revealing a politician's attitude towards the consensus and the political empowerment of the Hispanic electorate. It is a matter of solidarity. Members of Congress may feel they can continue to dismiss the political aspirations of the U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico with impunity, but the Hispanic vote is a growing power to be reckoned with, and the right of the U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico to self-determination is an issue that will come home to roost at the poll booth. Those that oppose the right of Puerto Ricans to self-determination will be perceived as biased or prejudiced against Hispanics. I am asking that Members support the bill for self-determination in Puerto Rico. It is the right thing to do. It is the right thing to do for Republicans, it is the right thing to do for Democrats, it is the right thing to do for Congress, and above all, it is the right thing to do for the Nation.","word.count":730,"sep11":-3.42134831460674,"years":1998.43820224719,"days":1224,"party":"Other","chamber":"","Topic 1":0.124027803974285,"Topic 2":0.016601915051685,"Topic 3":0.0122338113911057,"Topic 4":0.0196657898424535,"Topic 5":0.181108055758452,"Topic 6":0.00366727508022713,"Topic 7":0.072433709033427,"Topic 8":0.0920249017824453,"Topic 9":0.0175738388055109,"Topic 10":0.460662899280408},{"id":"10519970025194","body":"Norman Dicks: Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word","word.count":111,"sep11":-4.22752808988764,"years":1997.63202247191,"days":937,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.367482618638028,"Topic 2":0.0269207732900136,"Topic 3":0.0203109886831452,"Topic 4":0.109178590369666,"Topic 5":0.0106523276877785,"Topic 6":0.0109388435696006,"Topic 7":0.185084634950722,"Topic 8":0.230965221737532,"Topic 9":0.0172345784735437,"Topic 10":0.0212314225999703},{"id":"10920060036475","body":"Charles Grassley: Mr. President, on Wednesday, February 1, 2006, the House of Representatives passed the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, DRA, clearing the way for the President to sign this bill into law. This legislation was the product of a great deal of work on the part of Members and our dedicated staff and the experts who work in the congressional support agencies. I would like to highlight two provisions in the DRA: the Family Opportunity Act and the reauthorization of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and pay special tribute to the Members and staff who worked so hard on them over many years. Mr. President, I am particularly pleased that after years and years, the Family Opportunity Act is about to become law. This legislation has been something of a crusade of mine. This legislation extends Medicaid eligibility to families with a severely disabled child that are faced with either staying poor in order to continue to qualify for Medicaid or, worse, relinquishing a child to the State so that the child can receive the services that the child needs. The introduction of the Family Opportunity Act was motivated by the circumstances of individual families, the Melissa Arnold Family and the Dylan Lee Family. I offer my heartfelt thanks to these families for sharing their struggles with me and for being the inspiration for this legislation. I pay special tribute to my partner in this endeavor, Senator Edward Kennedy, who is a tireless champion on behalf of children and those with disabilities. During the many years we worked side by side on this bill, Senator Kennedy was most ably assisted by Connie Garner, of his staff. On my own staff, I would like to single out the efforts of Hope Cooper who worked for many years on the Family Opportunity Act and whose knowledge and compassion were invaluable assets in developing the bill. I also appreciate the work done by policy leads, Leah Kegler, Becky Shipp; health policy director, Mark Hayes; deputy staff director, Ted Totman, and staff director for the Finance Committee, Kolan Davis. I am grateful for the work done by Jeanne De Sa and Eric Rollins at the Congressional Budget Office and Ruth Ernst at the Office of Legislative Counsel, especially for their patience in analyzing and drafting the many different versions of the legislation. Mr. President, the reauthorization of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, TANF, has been a long and very difficult process, spanning three Congresses. Everyone who has worked on this reauthorization has been guided by a fundamental principle: helping those in deep and persistent poverty achieve the economic self sufficiency needed to overcome that poverty. We may disagree on some of the best ways to overcome poverty, but everyone who devoted their labor to this program did so out of the best of intentions. I particularly thank my friend and partner on the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Max Baucus, for his work on this program over the past 5 years. We didn't always agree, but we kept working together until we finally got to a compromise that satisfied us both. I hope at some point we can revisit some of the common themes we developed together in the PRIDE bill. I thank Senator Baucus's staff who worked on this issue over the past 5 years, Doug Steiger, Kate Kahan, and Liz Fowler. They are passionate, knowledgeable, and care deeply about low-income programs and the individuals who rely upon them. Other Members and their staff who contributed to the policy and the process include, the initial ``Tripartisan'' members: Senator John Breaux and his staff, Sara Triagle and Michelle Easton; Senator Orrin Hatch and his staff, Becky Shipp; Senator Jay Rockefeller and his staff, Barbara Pryor; Senator Olympia Snowe and her staff, Carolyn Holmes; Senator James Jeffords and his staff, Justin King; Senator Blanche Lincoln and her staff, Elizabeth MacDonald and Mike Anzick. Other critical Members and staff include: Majority Leader Bill Frist and his staff, Eric Ueland and Libby Jarvis; Minority Leader Tom Daschle, and his staff, Joan Huffer; Senator Rick Santorum and his staff, Randy Brandt; Senator Christopher Dodd and his staff, Grace Reef; and Megan Hauck, who contributed as a advisor to Senator Don Nickles, as well as working at the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Legislation and the White House. Throughout much of the process, Members and staff were indebted to the expertise of the Director of the Office of Family Assistance at the Administration of Children and Families, Andrew Bush and the Assistant Secretary for Human Service Policy in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, Don Winstead.

One of the other elements of our alternative budget plan would embrace once again, as was the policy during the Clinton administration and when Democrats controlled the United States Congress, was the concept of PAYGO. That is, I know, with you as a member of the Budget Committee and Mr. Spratt as the ranking member, is an idea that our Democratic Members have championed as a part of our alternative. And we have done that on a number of occasions and attempted to get the Republicans to go along with us and the concept of PAYGO. PAYGO is very simple. We came from States, and in our State legislatures you have to operate in the black. Just like people who are members of their families, they struggle not to have to go into debt, not to have to live paycheck to paycheck and not to have to go into massive credit card debt. Unfortunately, the Republican leadership here does not subscribe to that philosophy, and that is evidenced by their rejection of pay-as- you-go rules whereby we would not spend more than we have. On March 17 of last year, Mr. Spratt, our ranking member on the Budget Committee, offered a substitute amendment to the 2006 budget resolution that failed 165 to 264, no Republicans supporting pay-as- you-go legislation. And we have the rollcall indicating that we were supportive. Again, Mr. Spratt offered another amendment dealing with PAYGO that would have reestablished PAYGO, 224 Republicans voting ``no,'' none voting ``yes,'' and it failed, to 232. So we have certainly tried. It is not for our lack of trying to make sure that we restore some fiscal discipline here. The thing that has been the most frustrating for me as a new Member of Congress, and I am sure it is a frustration you have faced, is that the Republicans try to lead people to believe that they are the party of fiscal responsibility. Yet, I am someone who believes that actions have to back up words and talk is cheap, and that seems to be all that they have been about since I have gotten here.","word.count":360,"sep11":4.78089887640449,"years":2006.6404494382,"days":4144,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.120459703100075,"Topic 2":0.140675541423042,"Topic 3":0.511059774505168,"Topic 4":0.0399194919833998,"Topic 5":0.0103326988200694,"Topic 6":0.00609143220808605,"Topic 7":0.116965212784351,"Topic 8":0.00807170433801464,"Topic 9":0.0422749279289843,"Topic 10":0.00414951290881009},{"id":"10820040011091","body":"George Nethercutt: Mr. Speaker, Washington State is facing a health care crisis because medical liability lawsuits have run amok.

What this means is women who are seeking an OB-GYN in some of our communities cannot find one to deliver their babies. That is a crisis. Emergency rooms are not able to stay open 24 hours a day; that is a crisis. We are losing doctors to Idaho, right across the line from my State.

There is every reason in the world that critics of any reform can try to give to mask the concept that we have to address the issue of medical liability reform first. We will not do that until we pass a bill in this House and we pass a bill in the other body so there can be communication and discussion and resolution of this problem. To do nothing does not solve the problem, Mr. Speaker. So I am pleased that this HEALTH Act is being brought up again. We have to make sure we establish again and again and again the commitment of the House to medical liability reform, because doctors, hospitals, nurses, and patients are at risk if we do not change this system, modify this system, reform this system with a commonsense proposal that will lower costs and premiums so that doctors can stay in business. The damage that is being done here is that we are losing very good physicians and hospitals are at risk, risking closing, and also nurses are leaving the practice. They are going elsewhere because they are concerned about the liability insurance that they cannot get in States like mine. I urge my colleagues, vote for this measure, vote again in this House to pass it. Then let us urge the other body to adopt the same sort of commonsense reform. We can do that.

It was my hope that we could reach an understanding. I thought, based on conversations, we might be able to work out some procedure to ensure that the three main issues--the gas tax repeal, the TEAM Act, and the minimum wage were split into three separate bills--that the Senate would be able to reach an agreement on an overall consent that would include these issues in a relatively short timeframe. But unfortunately that does not seem to be the case. I think it is fair to say that we have offered pretty much what my colleagues had requested, with some minor changes, a consent agreement that does, in fact, divide the three issues into separate bills and limits time on each issue. I think they could be concluded in as little as 5 or 6 hours. But now I understand that there are additional requests to not only separate the issues, but also to require the approval of the final language that the House is marking up in the committee today relative to the minimum wage. Obviously, I cannot dictate what the House does with minimum wage and cannot ensure what might finally come out of the conference. But it seems to me that what we should do is move ahead before Memorial Day, resolve these three issues, as well as the taxpayer bill of rights, which I understand there is no opposition to. The gas tax repeal is being held hostage because of the demands about the minimum wage. The so-called TEAM Act is unacceptable to my colleagues on the other side. I understand there will be a filibuster on that issue. I guess the bottom line is, we have been trying to figure out some way to resolve this issue. We have not reached it yet. I do not believe we will ever be in a position to say to my colleagues on the other side that we will guarantee, notwithstanding it is a Republican House of Representatives and a Republican Senate, that you draft the minimum wage proposal. I do not think that will happen because we have some ideas, amendments for the minimum wage. I do not know what my House colleagues have in mind, but they may report that out later on today. So I just suggest that we continue to work with the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle. Time is running. I hope that we can act on all these issues prior to Memorial Day. But this week we will probably be on the budget. Next week we hope to do the missile defense measure, along with the DOD authorization bill. That would not leave a lot of time for these three issues.

Mr. President, our most recent experience with the fiscal year 2008 Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act shows the need for a biennial appropriations and budget process. That one bill clearly demonstrated Congress is incapable of completing the budget, authorizing, and appropriations process on an annual basis and unfortunantly, this is not the first time. Congress should now act to streamline the system by moving to a 2- year, or biennial, budget process. This is the most important reform we can enact to streamline the budget process, to make the Senate a more deliberative and effective institution, and to make us more accountable to the American people. Moving to a biennial budget and appropriations process enjoys very broad support. President George W. Bush has supported a biennial budgeting process. Presidents Clinton, Reagan, and Bush also proposed a biennial appropriations and budget cycle. Leon Panetta, who served as White House Chief of Staff, OMB Director, and House Budget Committee chairman, has advocated a biennial budget since the late 1970s. Former OMB and CBO Director Alice Rivlin has called for a biennial budget the past two decades. Vice President Gore's National Performance Review and the 1993 Joint Committee on the Reorganization of Congress both recommended a biennial appropriations and budget cycle. A biennial budget will dramatically improve the current budget process. The current annual budget process is redundant, inefficient, and destined for failure each year. Look at what we struggle to complete each year under the current annual process. The annual budget process consumes 3 years: 1 year for the administration to prepare the President's budget, another year for the Congress to put the budget into law, and the final year to actually execute the budget. Today, I want to focus just on the congressional budget process, the process of annually passing a budget resolution, authorization legislation, and multiple appropriation bills. The record clearly shows that last year's experience was nothing new. Under the annual process, we consistently fail to complete action on multiple appropriations bills, to authorize programs, and to meet our deadlines. While we have made a number of improvements in the budget process, the current annual process is redundant and inefficient. The Senate has the same debate, amendments and votes on the same issue three or four times a year--once on the budget resolution, again on the authorization bill, and finally on the appropriations bill. Several years ago, I asked the Congressional Research Service, CRS, to update and expand upon an analysis of the amount of time we spend on the budget. CRS looked at all votes on appropriations, revenue, reconciliation, and debt limit measures as well as budget resolutions. CRS then examined any other vote dealing with budgetary levels, Budget Act waivers, or votes pertaining to the budget process. Beginning with 1980, budget related votes started dominating the work of the Senate. In 1996, 73 percent of the votes the Senate took were related to the budget. If we cannot adequately focus on our duties because we are constantly debating the budget throughout the authorizing, budgeting, and appropriations process, just imagine how confused the American public is about what we are doing. The result is that the public does not understand what we are doing and it breeds cynicism about our Government. Under the legislation we are introducing today, the President would submit a 2-year budget and Congress would consider a 2-year budget resolution and 2-year appropriation bills during the first session of a Congress. The second session of the Congress would be devoted to consideration of authorization bills and for oversight of Government agencies. Most of the arguments against a biennial budget process will come from those who claim we cannot predict or plan on a 2-year basis. For most of the budget, we do not actually budget on an annual basis. Our entitlement and revenue laws are under permanent law, and Congress does not change these laws on an annual basis. The only component of the budget that is set in law annually are the appropriated, or discretionary, accounts. The most predictable category of the budget are these appropriated, or discretionary, accounts of the Federal Government. Much of this spending is associated with international activities or emergencies. Because most of this funding cannot be predicted on an annual basis, a biennial budget is no less deficient than the current annual process. My bill does not preclude supplemental appropriations necessary to meet these emergency or unanticipated requirements. In 1993 I had the honor to serve as cochairman on a joint committee that studied the operations of the Congress. Senator Byrd testified before that committee that the increasing demands put on us as Senators has led to our ``fractured attention.'' We simply are too busy to adequately focus on the people's business. This legislation is designed to free up time and focus our attention, particularly with respect to the oversight of Federal programs and activities. Frankly, the limited oversight we are now doing is not as good as it should be. Our authorizing committees are increasingly crowded out of the legislative process. Under a biennial budget, the second year of the biennium will be exclusively devoted to examining Federal programs and developing authorization legislation. The calendar will be free of the budget and appropriations process, giving these committees the time and opportunity to provide oversight, review, and legislate changes to Federal programs. Oversight and the authorization should be an ongoing process, but a biennial appropriations process will provide greater opportunity for legislators to concentrate on programs and policies in the second year. A biennial budget cannot make the difficult decisions that must be made in budgeting, but it can provide the tools necessary to make much better decisions. Under the current annual budget process, we are constantly spending the taxpayers' money instead of focusing on how best and most efficiently we should spend the taxpayers' money. By moving to a biennial budget cycle, we can plan, budget, and appropriate more effectively, strengthen oversight and watchdog functions, and improve the efficiency of government agencies. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.

Tomorrow, we will be voting on whether to proceed to the consideration of the Family Prosperity Act, which is the compromise--I emphasize compromise-- permanent solution to the death tax; second, extending important tax provisions such as college tuition deductions, research and development, sales tax deductibility; and, third, raising the minimum wage with a 40-percent increase. This Senate will decide tomorrow morning whether these issues are sufficiently important to people across this country who are paying attention or whether they are not sufficiently important to bring to the Senate. That is what this vote is all about. A ``yes'' vote tomorrow morning to proceed to the bills tells the American family that we are listening to you, that we are with you, that we hear you, that we understand your daily challenges. A ``no'' vote to proceed to the bills tells the American family these issues are simply not sufficiently important for the Senate to consider, a permanent solution to the death tax, extending those tax provisions, raising the minimum wage. Friday's vote--tomorrow morning--is an important vote. I made it very clear that we will not split up the bills. I made it clear this is a package and we will move to proceed to them as such. Each Senator will, of course, be accountable to their constituents over the recess for how they vote, either with the American family or against the American family. Earlier this week, one of my distinguished colleagues came to the Senate and quoted President Truman and his whistlestop campaign and the ``do nothing Congress.'' Why? Because my colleague does not believe the issues addressed in this particular bill, the Family Prosperity Act, are matters of importance to the American people. Some do not believe eliminating the death tax is important to the American people, some do not believe extending tax relief is important to the American people, and some don't believe raising the minimum wage is important to the American people. Yet the majority of the American people believe each one of these issues is important and does deserve consideration. If you look at the permanent death tax, roughly 70 percent of Americans support repeal of the death tax. This is not repeal. We brought that to the floor and we got 55 votes, so we are moving in that direction, but that is not sufficient. So we have a compromise permanent solution. This is an issue that touches the lives and livelihoods of Americans from Washington, DC, to Washington State. Back home in Tennessee, Ann Bennett's family has farmed the same piece of land in Kingsport for the past 70 years for one generation and the other two generations make it a total of 130 years. Already, they have paid over $100,000 in death taxes so her father could inherit the farm from his father. When Ann's father passes on, Ann and her sisters have to come up with $2 million just to hold on to that family farm. At its core, the death tax is a cruel and unfair burden inflicted on America's small businesses, on farmers, and on families during a time of grieving and pain. It punishes everyday Americans such as Ann Bennett by forcing them to give up businesses that their loved ones worked their entire lives to build and to pass on. Whether it is farming or ranching or construction, they are all capital intensive, they are all labor intensive. But the cost of passing these enterprises on to future generations in one piece is often prohibitive. Partly as a result of the death tax, about 90 percent of family businesses don't survive for a third generation. Even those who manage to pass their family business on are adversely affected. Instead of spending money to innovate--to grow their businesses or to invest in new jobs that help our economy--they pay the Federal Government. We have allowed time to address many pressing issues already this Congress. We have acted. We have done something. And now it is time for us to do something about the death tax. It was imposed as a temporary measure during World War I. But since then it's managed to wedge its way tightly into our Tax Code. Americans have waited long enough for Congress to take the death tax burden off their backs with a permanent solution. Today is our chance to act. Similarly, for nearly 20 years Tennesseans waited for Congress to restore State sales tax deductibility. It is one of the provisions in the so-called ``tax extenders''. From 1986 until 2004, hard working Tennesseans were placed at a disadvantage--simply because Tennessee was one of seven States that choose to raise revenue primarily through a sales tax instead of an income tax. Congress and President Bush acted in 2004 to restore the State sales tax deductibility--and to restore fairness to Federal tax policy. But the provision expired last year--and more than 640,000 Tennessee families will suffer if the tax relief isn't extended. That is unacceptable. The State and local sales tax deduction is just 1 of more than 20 tax policy extensions included in the Family Prosperity Act. These extensions will keep taxes low, helping Americans find and keep work. They help families tackle the increasing cost of living. And they strengthen the economic security of hardworking Americans everywhere. To me, that is important. The final piece of the Family Prosperity Act increases the minimum wage. Specifically, it raises the minimum wage rate $2.10 over 36 months in three increments of 70 cents. That is a 40 percent increase in the minimum wage. It includes a tip credit provision that protects employee wages at their current level. In the seven States where there is no tip credit, this bill would allow the credit to apply only against future State increases in the minimum wage. It would not result in any workers' wages being lowered. Some have said otherwise, but that is simply not the case--and colleagues should not be misled by opponents of this bill into believing something that is simply not true. For young workers entering the job market for the first time--the minimum wage hike is welcome news. We're helping them meet the increasing cost of day-to-day living. As I said earlier this week, this--the Family Prosperity Act--is the last chance--the last chance--the Senate will have during the 109th Congress to give these workers a boost. There will always be new, emerging challenges to address here on the Senate floor. And it is our responsibility to address them--to deliver effective solutions in a timely manner. But it is also our responsibility to address those challenges that compound over time--the challenges and burdens that develop slowly and affect Americans with latent urgency. The death tax is one of those issues. So are tax relief extenders and raising the minimum raise. That is why we are taking up the death tax once again. That is why we are extending key tax relief provisions for other 2 years. And that is why we are raising the minimum wage. We are not ``doing nothing.'' We are doing something--about issues that concern hardworking Americans across the Nation.","word.count":1208,"sep11":5.01966292134831,"years":2006.87921348315,"days":4229,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0648312434752289,"Topic 2":0.0265394645711288,"Topic 3":0.0201206031655019,"Topic 4":0.354354267754468,"Topic 5":0.0014858593424932,"Topic 6":0.0140758642019475,"Topic 7":0.493581896359567,"Topic 8":0.00412006055601047,"Topic 9":0.019324609382791,"Topic 10":0.00156613119086404},{"id":"11020070022784","body":"Louie Gohmert: I thank the gentleman for yielding Much has been said about this legislation, my legislation. I want to thank Chairman Rahall and Mr. Young for their leadership in helping me correct a grave injustice, not just for the Native Americans, but also for the non-Native Americans, my constituents. I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, H.R. 2176, which is a commonsense fix of a very serious matter. The bill would provide for the settlement of certain land claims of the Bay Mills Indian Community and of the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe in Michigan. I have been working on this problem for over 10 years, and I first introduced legislation in 1999 in an effort to resolve this issue. I became involved in this land claim dispute at the request of the property owners at Charlotte Beach, not of the Native American tribes. Tribal claims to the land have created a cloud on their title, owned by my constituents in Charlotte Beach. As a result, local assessors have reduced the property values of the Charlotte Beach land owners by 90 percent because of the valid clouded title created by the Indian land claim dispute. The tribes' claim to the land in question dates back to 1855, when the U.S. Government signed the Treaty of Detroit, deeding the land to the tribes. However, the land was later sold to non-native land speculators without the Native Americans' consent, eventually resulting in an eviction of the tribal members. In order to finally resolve this land claim dispute, a settlement agreement was reached in 2002 between former Governor John Engler and the tribes. The settlement agreement has been reaffirmed by Michigan's current Governor, Governor Jennifer Granholm. After years of extensive negotiations between the parties, this bill represents a straightforward solution to this localized problem in my district. In order to implement this agreement, Congress must approve the negotiated land settlement. Unfortunately, incumbent casino gaming interests are opposed to this commonsense solution, and they have circulated misleading information in an attempt to derail this legislation. So let me take the opportunity to set the record straight on my legislation. First, this bill has nothing to do with ``off-reservation gaming acquisitions.'' It is a land claim settlement. Off-reservation gaming occurs when a tribe purchases private land and petitions the Secretary of Interior to place the land into trust for gaming purposes. This legislation ratifies a land claim settlement negotiated by the State of Michigan. This was done under the authority granted in IGRA's land claim exception clause. Second. In regards to the argument against the location of these lands, the selected lands were chosen by Governor John Engler in consultation with local communities, not with the tribes. The sites were selected for economic development. Local support had been expressed through a local referendum and through unanimous resolutions by the cities and counties, and it has an existing gaming market on the Canadian side of the border where U.S. dollars are being spent. Our legislation follows, rather than sets, congressional precedent for settling land claim disputes. Congress has passed over a dozen settlement acts on which replacement lands are eligible for gaming, including two that specifically state that the land is eligible for gaming, most recently that of the Torres Martinez Tribe of California and that of the Timbisha Shoshone Tribe, in 2000. Our legislation does not violate the wishes of Michigan voters. Opponents have attempted to confuse Members about the wishes of Michigan voters on this issue by citing passage of the 2004 referendum, which seeks to limit the expansion of private gaming in our State. The actual wording of the referendum states, ``A voter approval requirement does not apply to Indian tribal gaming.''","word.count":145,"sep11":5.83988764044944,"years":2007.69943820225,"days":4521,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.00402723664336972,"Topic 2":0.164475624750824,"Topic 3":0.00379801691756265,"Topic 4":0.00237670588430306,"Topic 5":0.302558104112245,"Topic 6":0.00435121836835595,"Topic 7":0.00106636141036066,"Topic 8":0.191830259022957,"Topic 9":0.00580706194223841,"Topic 10":0.319709410947783},{"id":"10620000029514","body":"Joe Pitts: Madam Speaker, on this day, September 6, 1774, 226 years ago, the first Congress assembled in Philadelphia. According to the Records of Congress, Congress established two important precedents on that day. First, rules of governing its procedures; and, second, it decided to open its sessions with prayer. John Adams provided the details on that second decision, reporting that ``When Congress first met, Mr. Cushing made a motion that it should be opened in prayer. It was opposed by one or two, because we were so divided in religious sentiment that we could not agree on the same act of worship. Mr. Samuel Adams rose and said, `He was no bigot, and could hear a prayer from a gentleman of piety and virtue, who was at the same time a friend to his country, and therefore he moved that Mr. Duche, an Episcopalian clergyman, might be desired to read prayers to the Congress tomorrow morning.' The motion was seconded and passed in the affirmative.'' Interestingly, although objections were raised against public prayers two centuries ago, Congress quickly learned that prayer was a unifying rather than a dividing force. Now, two centuries later, we still benefit from what they learned 226 years ago today.","word.count":202,"sep11":-1.03932584269663,"years":2000.8202247191,"days":2072,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.11408743018523,"Topic 2":0.0855161301795422,"Topic 3":0.00613531397006267,"Topic 4":0.166924073725355,"Topic 5":0.00687490585617435,"Topic 6":0.0050654480510384,"Topic 7":0.0218074035509021,"Topic 8":0.264262411809388,"Topic 9":0.322882496630637,"Topic 10":0.00644438604167123},{"id":"11020070028601","body":"Frank R.

Levin: Mr. President, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2202, the Immigration Control and Financial Responsibility Act of 1996. It has been said before, but it bears repeating that as a nation we must close the back door to illegal immigration if the front door of legal immigration is to remain open. This landmark legislation represents a major step toward that goal. Mr. President, as passed by the Senate, H.R. 2202 significantly augments the Nation's Border Patrol. The bill also provides the Department of Justice with important new legal tools to fight alien smuggling and document fraud. In addition, H.R. 2202 enhances the ability of the Justice Department to secure the prompt deportation of criminal aliens. Equally important, H.R. 2202 protects the taxpayers by taking numerous steps to assure that legal immigrants come to the United States to work, not to go on welfare. The one major provision of H.R. 2202 with which I disagree is the one that establishes pilot programs for various systems to verify the employment eligibility of new workers. Some have called this part of this bill the beginning of an eventual ``national identification system'' or ``national identification card.'' I share this concern. During the Senate's consideration of this illegal immigration bill, therefore, I voted to support the Abraham-Feingold amendment to strike the national identification pilot programs provisions from the legislation. On balance, though, H.R. 2202 is a strong bill. It will strike a powerful blow against illegal immigration. In the majestic words of the poet Emma Lazarus, America still lifts her ``lamp beside the Golden Door'' for legal immigrants. With this bill, however, we are now moving to put a new padlock on the back door to keep out those who seek to violate our laws against illegal immigration.","word.count":151,"sep11":-6.05056179775281,"years":1995.80898876404,"days":288,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.702586591378305,"Topic 2":0.10946686095811,"Topic 3":0.0206760252966967,"Topic 4":0.0386901282445053,"Topic 5":0.021021152607219,"Topic 6":0.0196610520849785,"Topic 7":0.0166835444742598,"Topic 8":0.0336547195124648,"Topic 9":0.0278846965391467,"Topic 10":0.00967522890431426},{"id":"10920050063471","body":"Mary Landrieu: Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with my good friends, Senator Pryor, Senator Domenici, and Senator Warner.

Again, I appreciate the fact that we will come together and vote on this resolution today as both Republicans and Democrats, because these schools, these DOD schools are exceptional in many ways. I want to just touch on my personal experience down at Camp Lejeune. Mr. Speaker, I have the privilege, as the gentleman from North Carolina said, to have Camp Lejeune, Cherry Point, Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in my district. In Camp Lejeune, for the 10 years I have been in office, I have had many occasions to go visit the schools at Camp Lejeune, both elementary schools and senior high schools. As fate would have it, shortly after the decision to go into Iraq, I had the opportunity to speak to the seniors in the auditorium, and I could tell that some of those young people, their faces, you could tell that they had parents who had already been deployed overseas, and I spoke to them and tried to encourage them to tell them how much we in Congress on both sides of the aisle appreciate the commitment their parents have made to this great Nation. I mention that for this reason: I found when I was there that day that there is a special bonding among the teachers and the administration and the students at these DOD schools, this one in particular at Camp Lejeune, that there is an environment there that is cohesive to the situation that these young people are finding themselves in because their parents have been deployed. One parent, in some cases, it was 2 parents, quite frankly, who had been overseas defending freedom in Iraq and also for the American people. There is one thing that I always wonder, is why, when something is working so well, why the Federal agency, in this case, the Department of Defense, wants, to study and see what the future of the schools needs to be? That is why I was so pleased that the gentleman from North Carolina introduced this resolution, and again, both sides are supporting the resolution. These schools are exceptional. These young people, time after time, when they take national tests, the students at the DOD schools are really doing as well, if not better, in most cases, than even the public schools. I am not here to compare one school to another school, but the record speaks for itself. These young kids at the DOD schools excel when it comes to these national tests. Also, I was touched that I had the privilege to visit the children at Camp Lejeune with special needs. I never will forget a little girl that met me in the hall when I was speaking to the teachers, and she held my hand as we walked to her class. I had a chance to observe and to talk to the teacher and to the assistant teacher as to the fine work they are doing with children with special needs at our DOD schools, again, this is Camp Lejeune. So my friend, the gentleman from North Carolina and the others, both Democrat and Republican who are on the floor today, to say thank you to our teachers, to our principals, and to our administrators at these DOD schools, we very much appreciate the great job they are doing. I do say, Mr. Speaker, God bless our men and women in uniform and their families and God bless America.","word.count":600,"sep11":2.71348314606742,"years":2004.57303370787,"days":3408,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0942587326706341,"Topic 2":0.0390622330882629,"Topic 3":0.00838375823910669,"Topic 4":0.00739266571363779,"Topic 5":0.0126838132219776,"Topic 6":0.0853409632574818,"Topic 7":0.0298373748421184,"Topic 8":0.403701722722803,"Topic 9":0.0338233155521844,"Topic 10":0.285515420691794},{"id":"10920060049274","body":"Lindsey Graham: I thank Senator Kennedy for yielding. I will try to add a little bit different perspective. Senator Kennedy is right. If you look at the chart with the numbers, the revenues taken in at a point in time from the immigrant legislation exceed the outlays, and that is what CBO says. My good friend Senator Coburn and others dispute that. I think CBO is something you use when you agree with them and something you run away from when they disagree with you. Their methodology is probably flawed when I agree with them and it is probably flawed when I disagree with them. What I am trying to bring to the table about the economic impact of this debate is that there are more people involved than just the Federal Government. It does seem as if, from a Federal Government perspective, it is probably good business to get people to pay taxes and get them legalized versus having them undocumented. That is one of the economic conditions we are dealing with, is how do you sign up people, who are here to work, in a regularized fashion so we will know who they are and they will contribute to social programs, not just take away, and they will not have to live in fear, and they can help through their tax contributions. It is true some of them withdraw services from programs set up for people who are on economic hard times, but generally speaking, I would argue the 11 million people we are talking about assimilating and the future flow people we are talking about coming here work very hard. We all have impressions of this group. My impression of the undocumented workforce we are talking about is it is not a group of people sitting around wanting something for nothing. They are doing five and six jobs a day, working very hard, and economically there has to be room in America for somebody like that. If there is no room in America for somebody who is willing to do the hardest job in America from sunup until sundown, then America has changed. We have 4.7 percent unemployment nationally. I am a Republican. I am going to take credit for it, along with my President, and share it with my Democratic colleagues. Whatever we are doing or failing to do, one thing I can tell you for sure: the economy is as good as it is ever going to get in your lifetime--4.7 percent unemployment. The GDP growth is over 4 percent. There is wage growth over 4 percent and an 11,000 stock market. One thing for sure is that the 11 million undocumented workers have assimilated into our economy and are not a drain because it is humming. That is just a fact. We can't issue a press release on Monday taking credit for the good economy and talk about a workforce that has been here for years and say it is going to kill the economy because it has not yet, nor will it ever. Our biggest problem in America from an employer point of view is how do you sign people up, knowing who is legal and who isn't. Let's fix it. Because you really don't know. What do employers tell me more than anything else? I need workers, particularly in the construction business, tourism business, agricultural business. I advertise within the native population, and I can't get enough workers. Our bill requires proof that an American has not been put out of a job, a native American citizen hasn't been put out of a job because of someone coming out of this pool of undocumented workers. The truth is, colleagues, we need these workers. A few years ago, Japan crossed a demographic line of having more older people than younger people. We are getting there. It is going to be impossible, because of the demographic changes in our country, to fill all of the jobs we need to keep this economy humming without assimilating more people. How do you do that? That is what this bill is about. The economics of assimilating hard- working people, who believe in hard work, who want to play by the rules, raise families, and join the military, is a net positive. You will never convince economists that the people we are talking about are a drain on our society. They have jobs that do not pay a lot right now, but they have a heart and a mindset that makes America a wonderful place to live. Just watch them go and watch them grow. Some of the children of this illegal immigrant, undocumented workforce are now in college, in military academies, and fighting our wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, just like every other group that came to America. You start on the bottom, and people around you don't really appreciate you at first, but you eventually work your way up. That is going to happen here. The budget impact of assimilating this undocumented workforce into our economy needs to be looked at in terms of dynamic scoring. That is what Senator Kennedy is calling for--dynamic scoring--because that is what he is basically saying. You need to look at all the things they do and not just at the services they take. You need to look at the economic needs of our economy for workers. We are short of workers. Let us not drive away people who are willing to work. Let us punish people who broke our laws but punish them proportionate to the crime. There are several avenues in the bill as to how you can come to America and work, but there is one thing in common for every approach to solving the illegal immigration problem. Here is what is in common: You have to work to stay. We are not letting people come here and just sit on the corner and suck us dry. In the underlying legislation, if you are out of work for over 45 days, you are ineligible for the program. You have to learn English, as part of this bill. You just can't come here and not assimilate. You have to take a civics class. You have to hold a job. You cannot break the law, and you have to assimilate into our society. An economic benefit will be gained if we allow that to happen. A social benefit will be gained if we allow that to happen. The cost of doing nothing is catastrophic. And how do you score it? How do you score the cost of having a border that is a joke? How do you score the cost of having a legal system nobody knows how to apply? How could you score the cost of having millions of people living around you who are scared to death? What I hope my colleagues will look at when it comes to the budget is not only what the Congressional Budget Office says but the reality of where we are as a nation. We need good, honest, hard-working people, decent people who will get up early and stay late to keep this economy humming. And they are here among us. Make them pay a just and fair debt for getting here by cutting ahead of the line, but do not ruin our economy in the process. I hope that when we look at the economic condition that this bill will create in America for our budget and our society, we will look at it in a dynamic way, in a realistic way, and come to grips with the idea that in 2006, America has assimilated these 11 million people who are working very hard. What do we do with them now? They are here. How do we control those who want to come after them? I am all for employing people on our conditions--not theirs--of regularizing, legalizing, making people pay a debt, pay fines, pay back taxes and future taxes, pay your way the best you can. But I am very confident that the net benefit to our country and our society by assimilating a needed workforce in a humane fashion is a budget winner and a winner for our society as a whole. I gladly will vote against this budget point of order because while you look at the dynamics of the economic condition of our country and the value the immigrant workforce has now and in the future, it is a plus for our country. And doing nothing is the consequence of this bill falling or failing. What will be the cost for the next generation of politicians to do something we can't do among ourselves now? It will be more, it will be harder. Let us do it now. Let us get it right the best we can and realize that America needs honest, hard-working, decent people now more than ever. They are among us, and let us figure out a win-win.","word.count":1493,"sep11":4.82022471910112,"years":2006.6797752809,"days":4158,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.162220123198245,"Topic 2":0.0837759842727801,"Topic 3":0.124530475337364,"Topic 4":0.00473654721080279,"Topic 5":0.150096828148003,"Topic 6":0.0202199589448087,"Topic 7":0.054876700949446,"Topic 8":0.391529273637848,"Topic 9":0.00430898842840715,"Topic 10":0.00370511987229619},{"id":"11020070070712","body":"Richard J. Durbin: Mr. President, earlier today, when I was at a hearing, my friend and colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley, came to the floor to speak about a provision which I have added to this bill. I would like to address Senator Grassley's remarks. Senator Grassley said that an amendment which I added in the Appropriations Committee, in his words, would ``lead to anarchy in the Medicaid financial arrangements.'' He said it would prevent CMS from taking any action relating to the rules related to Medicaid reimbursement and SCHIP reimbursement. Senator Grassley recounted a time not that long ago when there was abuse of the Medicaid Program; where, in fact, States had figured ways to receive Medicaid funds and multiply them through accounting methods and use them in many instances for other purposes. In fact, Senator Grassley talked about the fact that under this behavior of the past, the money the States managed to multiply through accounting techniques could be used for roads or for stadium construction. That is true. I thought it was an outrage. As a result, there was a hue and cry on Capitol Hill for a change in the law or more enforcement and these abuses were rooted out. I am happy to say my State of Illinois did not participate in any of these scams. I am proud they did not. Other States did, and it stopped, as it should have. Then there was a negotiation between the Federal Government and States about this Medicaid formula. It is extremely complex. I wish it were as easy as some would portray, but it is not. So many States had negotiated with the Federal Government to reduce the Medicaid payments or to adjust Medicaid payments to acceptable levels. Many provisions of Medicaid reimbursement that had been agreed to by the Federal Government were changed and amended. That happened. The Federal Government, through CMS, had the authority to do that, and they did. There are still several States in negotiation about this reimbursement from the Federal Government. I am hoping that negotiation will end in a positive way, as others have in the past, and I think it will. In the meantime, the Department of Health and Human Services comes in with a rule, a proposed rule, and says: Well, we would like to change the law in terms of these Medicaid reimbursements. Unfortunately, this rule they proposed is so sweeping it would cut off in my State of Illinois some $600 million in reimbursement to Medicaid providers, primarily public hospitals serving poor people. I want this negotiation to continue. Clearly the Federal Government has the authority to continue this negotiation. I will not stand and defend any misuse of Federal funds or fraud. My concern, and the reason I offered this amendment, was the rule is so sweeping it goes too far. Senator Grassley has made a point, and others have backed him up, that this is probably the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee of the Senate, not the Appropriations Committee that brings this bill to the floor. I will acknowledge that point, but I also want to make it clear, this isn't the first time we have talked about this issue. In fact, it has been 2 years now when Senator Grassley was chairman of the Finance Committee that we appealed to him to have Congress take the initiative and work out this problem. Unfortunately, Senator Grassley couldn't schedule it in his busy schedule on the Finance Committee, and nothing was done. The purpose of this amendment is simply to declare a moratorium on the new rule until we can put together this new approach through the Finance Committee. That is it. I am not standing here to defend any fraudulent practices. I don't want to take away from our Government any powers to enforce the law to stop any waste of taxpayers' dollars, but I want to make one point clear as well. When our State of Illinois entered into an agreement with the Federal Government about Medicaid reimbursement, it wasn't so we could use some backhanded accounting approach to build a road or a stadium. No. What we tried to do was to use accounting methods which would increase our opportunity to provide medical services to poor people and uninsured people. Our money we are receiving through Medicaid is used for health care and health care exclusively. This is the way it should be. It is a Medicaid program for health care. What we have done in Illinois with these funds is extend the reach of health care to uninsured people and provide services that otherwise would not be provided, such as specialized services many poor people never have a chance to receive. I am proud our State has used this opportunity to expand care to people who need it: neonatal care for children who were born too soon and need the absolute best care immediately, and specialized care for those in every stage of life that otherwise wouldn't be available to them. I say to my colleagues first, Senator Grassley is right, we should not tolerate fraud in any way in Medicaid. This amendment does not. Secondly, we should urge every State to negotiate their accounting standards so they are consistent with the Federal Government, and I think that is taking place and should continue. In addition, I think this rule needs to be stopped at this point in time. Let the Finance Committee step in. Let us come up with an approach that works. In the meantime, some States that could be affected by this rule are concerned. If there is a cutoff of funds from the Federal Government to treat poor people, we know what will happen. These people will fall between the cracks, they will come to an emergency room for charitable care if they are lucky, they won't have the preventive care they need to keep themselves and their families happy, and they will pay a price in their life in terms of the quality and length of their own lives that are at stake here. I urge my colleagues: Let's keep this provision in this supplemental appropriations bill. I urge my colleague Senator Grassley, whom I dearly respect as a real leader here in the Senate, to work with Senator Baucus and others. Let us address this issue, not with this sword hanging over our heads about a rule that could come down and cut off hundreds of millions of dollars worth of funds for health care for poor people, but in a rational way that gives to each State what it is entitled to, and no more.

It is projected that we will have a $1.6 trillion surplus in the Federal budget. House Resolution 4578 would set aside 90% of the budget surplus, $1.4 trillion, to protect the Social Security system by depositing this amount into a new Treasury account entitled the ``Protect Social Security Account.'' The Social Security system is a supplemental retirement benefit to recipients for their life of diligent service and dedication to their jobs, their families, and their community. Accordingly, H.R. 4578 will help stabilize the Social Security system from the threat of permanent insolvency. In turn, H.R. 4578 will help to ensure that the future inheritors of the Social Security system reap a harvest from the seeds of hard work and toil that they will sow as time progresses. In closing, H.R. 4578 is certainly one important step forward in ensuring a sound Social Security system for future beneficiaries.

In lengthy testimony before the congressional joint inquiry that reviewed the events surrounding the September 11 attacks, Mr. Clarke is equally effusive in his praise for his actions of the Bush administration. It is my hope we will be able to get that testimony declassified. That request has been made so all Senators may review it and discuss it as well. But it is effusive praise under oath. I do not know what Mr. Clarke's motive is. I have no earthly idea what his motive for these charges is. Is it personal gain? Is it partisan gain? Is it in some way personal profit? Is it animus because of his failure to win a promotion with the Bush administration? I just do not know. None of us is going to ever know. But one thing is clear, and that is his motive could not possibly be to bring clarity or true understanding of how we avoid future September 11 attacks. There are five points I would like to make, five points that I find absolutely inexplicable about Mr. Clarke's performance this past week. I have waited to come to the floor until the end of the week because I couldn't really believe what Mr. Clarke was saying, based on what we know of his past performance and his participation in the former administration. I wanted to have time, and I will make these five points in a quick fashion. Point No. 1: In an e-mail to the National Security Adviser 4 days after the September 11 attacks, Mr. Clarke expressed alarm that ``when the era of national unity begins to crack'' an effort to assign responsibility for the 9/11 attacks will begin. Mr. Clarke, in the e-mail, then proceeds to lay out in detail a defense of his own personal actions before the attack and those of the entire administration, all of that spelled out in the e-mail. Mr. Clarke clearly, when we look at his e-mail, was consumed by the desire to dodge any blame for the 9/11 attacks; while at the very same moment rescuers were still searching the rubble at the site of the World Trade Center looking for survivors, he was looking for some way to dodge blame for himself. In my mind, this offers some insight, maybe even perfect insight, as to what drove him to write his book. The second point, in August 2002, the interview I read, Mr. Clarke gave a thorough account of the Bush administration's very proactive policy against al-Qaida. When presented with that interview, Mr. Clarke tries to explain away that media performance, the interview itself, by suggesting, well, I just gave the interview in that way as a loyal servant to the administration. A loyal administration official? Does Mr. Clarke understand the gravity of the issues this body, we in the Congress, the United States, is facing as we review through that 9/11 Commission the gravity of the charges that have been made by him? If in the summer of 2001 he saw the threat from al-Qaida as grave as he now says it was, and if he found the response of the administration so inadequate, as he now says it was, why did he wait until Sunday, March 21 of 2004 to make his concerns known? It simply does not make sense. There is not a single public record of Mr. Clarke making any objection whatsoever in the period leading up to or following the 9/11 attacks. There is nothing in the public record. There is no threat from him to resign. There is no public protest. There is no plea to the President, to the Congress, to the public to heed the advice he now says was ignored. If Mr. Clarke held his tongue because he was loyal, then shame on him for putting policies above principle, but if he is manufacturing these charges for some sort of personal profit or some sort of political gain, he is a shame to this Government. Fortunately, I have not had the opportunity to work with such an individual who would write solicitous and self-defending e-mails to his supervisor, the national security adviser, and then by his own admission lie to the press out of some self-conceived notion of loyalty, to reverse himself on all accounts for the sale of a book, a book which obviously is very popular. It is selling now as I speak. The third point I would like to make is Mr. Clarke told two entirely different stories under oath. In July 2002, in front of the congressional joint inquiry on the September 11 attacks, Mr. Clarke said under oath the administration actively sought to address the threat posed by al-Qaida during its first 7 months in office. It is one thing for Mr. Clarke to dissemble in front of the media, in front of the press, but if he lied under oath to the Congress, it is a far more serious matter. As I mentioned, the Intelligence Committee is seeking to have Mr. Clarke's previous testimony declassified so as to permit an examination of Mr. Clarke on the two differing accounts. Loyalty to any administration will be no defense if it is found he has lied before Congress. Fourth, notwithstanding Mr. Clarke's efforts to use his book first and foremost to redirect, to shift blame, to shift attention from himself, it is also clear Mr. Clarke and his publisher did adjust the release date of his book in order to make maximum gain from the publicity around the 9/11 hearings. Assuming the controversy around this series of events does, in fact, drive the sales of his book, Mr. Clarke will make a lot of money for exactly what he has done. I personally find this to be an appalling act of profiteering, of trading on insider access to highly classified information and capitalizing upon the tragedy that befell this Nation on September 11, 2001. Mr. Clarke must renounce any plan to personally profit from this book. Finally, it is understandable why some of the families who lost loved ones on that tragic and horrible day, September 11, find Mr. Clarke's performance this week appealing. The simple answers to a terrible tragedy, to the very human desire to find an answer of why, to help explain why on that beautiful fall day 2\\1/2\\ years ago a series of events shattered their lives forever. In his appearance before the 9/11 Commission, Mr. Clarke's theatrical apology on behalf of the Nation was not his right, was not his privilege, and was not his responsibility. In my view, it was not an act of humility but it was an act of arrogance and manipulation. Mr. Clarke can and will answer for his own conduct, but that is all. Regardless of Mr. Clarke's motive or what he says or implies in his new book, the fact remains this terrible attack was not caused by the Government of the United States of America. No administration was responsible for the attack. Our Nation did not invite the attack. The attack on 9/11 was the evil design of a determined and hate-filled few who slipped through the defenses of a nation, a nation that treasures its freedoms, that treasures its openness, that treasures its convenience. That our defenses failed is cause enough to review the sequence of events leading up to that awful day, and we must and will understand how to do better, balancing our determination to protect our Nation with that equal resolve to protect our liberties. The answer to Mr. Clarke's--and I clearly feel they are self- serving--charges is that, in fact, we all bear that responsibility, and we recognize that. Every one of us who served in Government before and at the time of the 9/11 attacks also has the responsibility to do our best to avoid such tragedy in the future. If we are to learn lasting lessons from the examination of the 9/11 attacks, it must be toward this end, not an exercise in finger pointing, not an exercise in blame shifting, not an exercise in political score settling.","word.count":1365,"sep11":2.60393258426966,"years":2004.46348314607,"days":3369,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0982081812405626,"Topic 2":0.120560051325526,"Topic 3":0.0188799266827798,"Topic 4":0.0208629028760847,"Topic 5":0.3075840384939,"Topic 6":0.00596038397401552,"Topic 7":0.00536212698347979,"Topic 8":0.0655605494156066,"Topic 9":0.0101838385789803,"Topic 10":0.346838000429064},{"id":"11020080019582","body":"Roy Blunt: I thank my friend for that information. There are really two topics there I want to talk about just briefly. One is the refinery capacity itself. I think there's probably more reason than capacity that there's only been one permit in 30 years for refineries. But refineries are really a separate issue from whether the oil is available or not. In fact, you could argue, we'd have more refinery use if we had more oil available. I do know that we imported gas last year. I think importing oil is bad. I think importing gas and paying somebody to take that raw material of oil and turn it into gas is a worse idea. It's hard for me to believe that people that run refineries would be doing that if the refineries were the problem. In terms of the leases, clearly, in the last 7 years, the amount of leased public lands has almost doubled. Most of that drilling has been for gas. In fact, our natural gas numbers are quite a bit better than they were before that started. Secondly, I think something like 52 percent of the exploration produces no product. It's a 10-year lease. Most of those leases are now beginning to get into the middle of that 10-year period of time. I certainly hope that we're encouraging, without doing anything that violates what we've already agreed to, that we're encouraging that to be done. And I think, frankly, I personally think, and have for a long time, that drilling in the ANWR in the area that was set aside for drilling by President Carter and the Congress in 1980, is part of the solution. But it's only part of the solution. And wherever we have those resources, we're the only country in the world where coastal drilling is possible that doesn't allow it to happen. I think we need to revisit that. And I think the American people are at the point that they want to revisit that as well. But this discussion is exactly the discussion we hope to have, a discussion that leads to more production and looking for the future. My good friend said that many on our side think that drilling's the only solution. I haven't heard that. What I've heard is many on our side think it's part of an immediate, short-term solution. But in the last Congress and the Republican Congresses before that, there was lots of legislation that encouraged alternatives, renewables. We want to still do that. Most of that requires a lot of transition in the economy and will take a while. Announcing that we were going to go vigorously after our own resources, I, at least, believe would have impact on that last topic you brought up, the futures market. If we announced we were going after substantial resources that we have, in fact, resources that are now believed to be significantly more substantial than they were 5 or 10 years ago, that would have impact on the futures market. And we should be looking at that market and see what's driving that and what we could do about it, in addition to thinking we're going to just simply regulate a worldwide market from the United States of America. I would yield.","word.count":545,"sep11":6.92696629213483,"years":2008.78651685393,"days":4908,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0241754508641491,"Topic 2":0.446048872467773,"Topic 3":0.162973184128662,"Topic 4":0.0381603175142291,"Topic 5":0.0193588385300463,"Topic 6":0.287215188195105,"Topic 7":0.00264869308862482,"Topic 8":0.00866363782684882,"Topic 9":0.0089216236702228,"Topic 10":0.00183419371434015},{"id":"10920050020831","body":"Mark Souder: I thank the gentleman.

Mr. Speaker, the Federal Government spends a lot of money. The American people understand that instinctively. In fact, let me give some context to it. The United States' economy is a $14 trillion annual economy. The second largest economy in the world is Japan, approximately $4 trillion annual economy. The third largest economy, if you define it this way, would be the Federal Government. So 1 year of spending by the Federal Government would be the third largest economy in the world. $3 trillion, the largest budget in history, is what passed on this floor 4 weeks ago. Again, to provide a little context to that. $3 trillion budget. That's the Federal Government spending your tax dollars, the American families' taxpayer money for families in Ohio and across this country spending at $100,000 a second, $6 million a minute, $350 million an hour. I mean, even by politicians' standards, that is spending money like crazy. The Federal Government spends, again, just to provide some context, and I appreciate the work that everyone has done and what the previous figures have said. The Federal Government spends $25,000 per year per family. Instead of spending $25,000 per family, if we would just spend $20,000 we could balance the budget in 1 year. Just spending $20,000 per family, we could do it. The previous speakers have talked about the tax burden that was also contained in this budget, $600 billion in taxes. You always hear about tax-and-spend politicians. I actually argue that it's just the opposite. In fact, the gentleman from Tennessee just talked about this. It's spending tax. Spending always drives the equation. So to make sure that this $3 trillion could be spent, this budget contains the largest tax increase in the history of our country. At a time when families are already dealing with tough economic situations in their family and in their communities, the last thing we need is higher taxes. You can compound all of this situation by what we heard last week. And I just want to read from the trustees' report, the 2008 Social Security and Medicare trustees' report, because I think it's poignant to this, a discussion about where we are at this point in our Nation's history. The trustees said, We are increasingly concerned about the inaction on the financial challenges facing the Social Security and Medicare programs. The longer action is delayed, the greater will be the required adjustments, the larger the burden on future generations, and the more severe the detrimental economic impact on our Nation. The longer we wait to do anything, the tougher it is going to be to address it and fix the problem. In fact, outgoing Comptroller General David Walker has said this: We run the risk, for the first time in American history, turning over a worse financial picture to the next generation. It's never happened before in the history of the United States. One of the reasons we are the greatest countries in history is because parents make sacrifices for their children so they can have a better economic situation, a better life, a better standard of living than what we have. We run the risk of beginning to turn that. We have got to begin to address that. I just want to bring up two simple concepts that were proposed in the Budget Committee by Members of the Republican party and the RSC. We offered two simple ideas. One was, it's time for a second Grace Commission. If you remember, President Reagan put together the Grace Commission. He had outside business people come in and look at the Federal Government, look at the government, say, Where is the waste? Where is the fraud? Where is the redundancy? Where is the ridiculousness? Let's get rid of it and save taxpayer money and better spend taxpayer money. Back in the 1980s, they identified $400 billion in waste, fraud, and redundancy. Certainly we can find some savings by doing that. The Grace Commission, unfortunately, was defeated in committee. We also offered an amendment that said let's hold the line on spending. Outside of the military, let's just hold the line, and let's keep the baseline lower, which saves us a lot of money in the outyears. And we made the argument in committee that this won't solve the problem, but this will better position our Congress, better position our government to deal with what we know is coming, to deal with what the trustees reported last week is coming relative to Social Security and Medicare. Two simple ideas that we couldn't even get passed in committee because the majority party wouldn't go for it. Things that we need to do to long-term begin to address the situation. As the previous speaker said, and I will close with this and turn it back over, he's confident that we will get this right. I am, too. Not because the politicians in Washington get it but because the American people do. The old adage is often true: Most politicians don't see the light; they feel the heat. And they feel the heat from their constituents because their constituents have the common sense of the folks, like in East Tennessee and back in western Ohio as well, and they understand the situation is real, they understand it's time for politicians and elected officials to step forward and say, Enough is enough. Let's fix this because it's about our kids and about our grandkids. That's why I applaud the leadership of the gentlewoman from Tennessee.","word.count":952,"sep11":6.72752808988764,"years":2008.58707865169,"days":4837,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0528727511288829,"Topic 2":0.585085843436197,"Topic 3":0.0446968636981394,"Topic 4":0.0861636776434748,"Topic 5":0.00843826013505903,"Topic 6":0.164765005834597,"Topic 7":0.00394639452833531,"Topic 8":0.00463113072195679,"Topic 9":0.0467259240693937,"Topic 10":0.00267414880396454},{"id":"10620000058021","body":"Daniel Akaka: Mr. President, I am proud to introduce legislation which would award the Medal of Honor to James K. Okubo, Ed W. Freeman, and Andrew J. Smith. There is no doubt that these three individuals are deserving of this award based on their brave and selfless service in defense of our great nation. The passage of this measure makes it possible for these men to receive a long overdue and well-deserve honor. This legislation marks the culmination of my efforts to recognize James K. Okubo for his acts of gallantry during World War II. James K. Okubo was born in Ancacortes, Washington, raised in Bellingham, Washington, and interned at Tule Lake, California. Mr. Okubo entered military service in Alturas, California on May 22, 1943 and was discharged from the Army in December 1945. Following his military service, Mr. Okubo was a professor at the University of Detroit Dental School. Mr. Okubo passed away following a car accident in 1967. Mr. Okubo served as a medic, member of the Medical Detachment, 442nd Regimental Combat Team. For his heroism displayed over a period of several days in rescuing and delivering medical aid to fellow soldiers during the rescue of the ``Lost Battalion'' from Texas, he was recommended to receive the Medal of Honor. The medal, however, was downgraded to a Silver Star. The explanation provided at the time was that as a medic, James S. Okubo was not eligible for any award higher than the Silver Star. Due to my concern that Mr. Okubo did not receive full recognition for his acts of heroism and bravery, I requested reconsideration of Mr. Okubo's case under section 1130, Title 10 of the United States Code. The Senior Army Decorations Board reviewed the case and submitted it to Secretary Caldera recommending an upgrade to the Medal of Honor. Secretary Caldera approved the recommendation which resulted in this important measure. This legislation is especially significant as fellow members of Mr. Okubo's unit will be awarded the Medal of Honor next week. It is my hope that this legislation will be enacted shortly, thereby allowing the Okubo family to participate in this auspicious event with the other families of members from the 100th Battalion, 442nd Regimental Combat Team. Mr. Okubo's heroism on the battlefield is an inspiration to all who believe in duty, honor, and service to one's country. Mr. Okubo takes his rightful place among America's great war heroes. He is a shining example of the sacrifices made by so many other Asian Pacific Americans during World War II, who served our country so ably in spite of the difficulties they faced as members of a suspect minority.","word.count":441,"sep11":-1.27808988764045,"years":2000.58146067416,"days":1987,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.112891634911012,"Topic 2":0.416014996983485,"Topic 3":0.0129700473699922,"Topic 4":0.0230257032834679,"Topic 5":0.394929346657944,"Topic 6":0.00528220887801909,"Topic 7":0.00953011354978842,"Topic 8":0.00999874365157409,"Topic 9":0.00906505505892476,"Topic 10":0.0062921496557925},{"id":"11020080050050","body":"Richard J. Durbin: Mr. President, Senator Reid could not be here this morning and asked me to come to the floor if a response was necessary, and a response is necessary. There are two fundamentally different approaches when it comes to America's energy futures between the Democratic side and the Republican side. The Democratic side believes that first we have to do everything we can to protect consumers of America from price gouging. We know what is happening. We cannot go to Illinois, Arkansas, Kentucky, or Colorado and not run into people saying we cannot understand why gasoline prices are so high. We know the price of a barrel of oil has gone up to record high levels because of price manipulation by the Saudis, OPEC, and other countries, and the Republican approach to this totally ignores it. We know the oil companies across the United States last week reported record profits in the first quarter of this year. Since President Bush came to office, the profits of the oil companies have more than quadrupled and the price of gasoline has more than doubled. Does the Republican approach even address this? The answer is no. We have, in the Democratic approach, a windfall profits tax, which says to these oil companies: There is a limit beyond which you cannot go in gouging consumers and overcharging them for your products. As airlines are faced with bankruptcy, as truckers cannot afford to fill their rigs on the highways, as the cost of energy is passed on to us as higher food prices and the like, it is absolutely unconscionable that the oil companies continue to show record profits quarter after quarter, year after year, at the expense of our economy. The Democratic approach deals with that. We go to the fundamentals. The windfall profits tax says to the oil companies: There is a limit to what you can take. Beyond that, the Government is going to tax you and make it clear to you that raising prices is not the answer. Second, we are going to stop putting more oil at high prices into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. If there ever was a time we should not be taking oil off the market, this is that time. We also provide in our bill for going after this OPEC coalition, the price collusion that is going on at the expense of the American economy. We deal with price gouging to make sure the companies that engage in it know they are going to pay a heavy price for that kind of conduct. And we go after speculation, if it is excessive, to try to make sure we fuel any fires of speculation that might be adding to the cost of energy. What do the Republicans offer in return? Drilling, drilling, drilling. They do not understand one fundamental fact: The United States has within its grasp, in our territory and territory we control, only 3 percent of the world's supply of oil--3 percent.

In assessing the push factors, we must not overlook the role of the government of Mexico. On a human level, it is a sad fact that people are motivated to make what is often a dangerous trek north to the United States because of the absence of economic opportunity in Mexico itself. Yet this flow of illegal immigration into the United States acts as a pressure relief valve by allowing the Mexican government to escape political accountability to those it has failed. Ironically, the Mexican government's laissez fare attitude towards immigration out of Mexico is not reflected in its policy concerning its own southern border. When you hear the President of Mexico or other Mexican politicians rail against the House-passed border control bill, please keep in mind that when it comes to their own border policies, all of the rhetoric concerning the right to migration is suddenly nowhere to be found. In the end, the Mexican government's policy will prove to be shortsighted and will ultimately cause serious damage to their own country. Imagine the long-term effects of a nation losing millions of its hardest working younger people. The future of Mexico is sending its government a clear and unmistakable message of adios as they vote with their feet. Furthermore, when one factors Mexico's demographic future into the equation, a dire picture emerges. According to an article by Philip Longman in the May/June issue of Foreign Affairs, ``Mexican fertility rates have dropped so dramatically, the country is now aging five times faster than is the United States. It took 50 years for the American median age to rise just five years, from 30 to 35. By contrast, between 2000 and 2050, Mexico's median age, according to U.N. projections, will increase by 20 years, leaving half the population over 42. Meanwhile, the median American age in the year 2050 is expected to be 39.7.'' Thus, ultimately illegal immigration from Mexico into the U.S. is not good for either Mexico or the United States. According to the Associated Press, President Fox has characterized the House immigration bill as, quote, stupid. To his credit, the same AP story quoted President Fox as acknowledging that his government must ``generate opportunities here in Mexico.'' However, it is the responsibility of the United States Government to control our own borders and to take action to reduce the pull factors which draw people to the United States. We must demagnetize the attraction of illegal employment in the U.S. Unfortunately, our track record here reflects a failure of government policy on our side of the border. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, IRCA, or Simpson- Mazzoli, for the first time imposed sanctions on employers for the hiring of those ineligible to work in the United States. Yet since the passage of that bill, administrations of both political parties have failed to enforce the law. The fact that there were only three cases last year, three, of a notice to file a prosecution for the unlawful hiring of illegal aliens is utterly indefensible. There must be a will to enforce the law. I wish to recount what in retrospect was the death knell to an effective regime of employer sanctions. An amendment to Simpson-Mazzoli was accepted which completely undermined the employment verification system. In its place, a series of documents required to be submitted with the I-9 employment eligibility verification form was substituted. The end result was the creation of a new cottage industry for the production of false documentation. I would like to emphasize once again that it was the negation of an effective employer verification system, which in combination with the lack of enforcement, undermined the usefulness of employer sanctions as an immigration enforcement tool. It was for this reason that the basic pilot project was created in 1996 by this Congress. The system allows employers to voluntarily check the names and Social Security numbers of its employees against the records maintained by the Social Security Administration and the Department of Homeland Security. Building on this project, H.R. 4437, the House-passed bill, would create a nationwide mandatory program. Unlike the watered-down language in the 1986 bill, the employment verification provisions in the House-passed bill offers a genuine prospect for effective employer sanctions necessary to demagnetize the attraction of unlawful employment in the U.S. An effective employer sanctions regime, coupled with the need to fully fund the additional 2,000 Border Patrol positions authorized this year and in the out years, is essential if we are going to control illegal immigration. At the same time if we are to maximize the cooperation of employers with the implementation of an effective system of employer sanctions, it is necessary to ensure that in those cases where U.S. workers are unavailable, employers have the option of employing temporary foreign workers. Let me suggest that regulating the stream of workers which have crossed back and forth our southern border since the 1870s will facilitate the job of a larger Border Patrol and the implementation of an effective system of employer sanctions. By definition however, in a temporary worker program, the workers should be temporary. Along the lines of an amendment I offered unsuccessfully in 1986, workers could work in the United States for up to 10 months of the year. During that time a portion of their wages could be withheld. The money would be placed in an escrow account and would only be returned to the workers upon their return to their home country--in most cases--Mexico. The proposal has a built in incentive for the temporary workers to return home to work their own small farms and to reunite with their families. In fact, Mexico and Canada have entered into a temporary agricultural worker program along these lines, which by all accounts has operated quite successfully. Finally, we cannot avoid the issue of what we will do with those who have entered our country illegally and have settled in our communities. I certainly do not favor an amnesty. But the use of the word ``amnesty'' does not excuse anyone on this side of the argument from explaining exactly what they propose to do with as many as 11 million people. By the same token, those who have violated our laws should not be allowed to cut in line in front of those who have obeyed them. A middle ground solution would allow those undocumented persons with sufficient equities in our society to remain. They could continue to work and travel back and forth between the United States and their home country. They would be legal residents, ``blue card'' holders if you will. However, they would not be afforded the legal equivalent of a diamond lane to citizenship. If they wish to become citizens, they would be required to return home, file an application and get in line like everyone else. Such requirements are necessary to reassure Americans who have been turned off by the ideologically driven multicultural agenda of those groups promoting identification with the Mexican flag, an alternative national anthem, and celebration of May Day in solidarity with leftist Mexican trade unions. It is hard for me to conceive of anything which could do more damage to the case one might make on behalf of those who demand acceptance by us to be equal partners in our society. For the common element of all immigrants who have come to this land has been a deep and burning desire to become Americans. The welcome mat extended to previous generations of immigrants was predicated upon a commitment to a common patrimony. Nothing less should be expected of those who currently seek to become a part of the tapestry of a larger tradition and history of American immigration.","word.count":247,"sep11":3.71629213483146,"years":2005.57584269663,"days":3765,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.373648946580288,"Topic 2":0.303451509597796,"Topic 3":0.136043105009621,"Topic 4":0.0196952873045307,"Topic 5":0.0929972983209541,"Topic 6":0.0269204726791738,"Topic 7":0.00918711533187131,"Topic 8":0.0192777172932521,"Topic 9":0.0119260986453415,"Topic 10":0.00685244923717056},{"id":"11020080056255","body":"Christopher J.

Now, if the Senator wants to say, well, what about these $75,000 jobs? The GAO pointed out that there is no increase in the salary of these workers. I thought supply and demand said that if we have that great a demand, we are going to see an increase in salaries; right? Wrong. The GAO report says there is no indication of that.

That is the case, in many instances. Madam President, I find it difficult to just accept the Senator's argument that this really is just the pure free market system working at its best. I think we owe something to American workers. It is so interesting that all of these companies want to have a free enterprise system--except when it comes to paying wages and salaries.

From the debate that we've had thus far, you might think that this is pretty straightforward. Upstream states against downstream states, in a conventional battle about who gets water, how much they get, and when they get it. I'm not going to kid anybody. That is a big part of the debate. I'm from an upstream state. We believe that we've been getting a bad deal for years. We want more balanced management of the system. That will, among other things, give more weight to the use of the water for recreation upstream, at places like Fort Peck reservoir in Montana. Under the current river operations, there are times when the lake has been drawn down so low that boat ramps are a mile or more from the water's edge. Our project manager at Fort Peck, Roy Snyder, who does a great job at that facility, has talked to me about how much healthier the river would be with a spring rise/split season management. But it's not just a conventional battle over water. There's more to it. A lot more. You wouldn't necessarily know that from the text of the provision itself. It says that none of the funds made available in the bill: That's what the bill says. Here's what it does. Simply put, it prohibits the Secretary of the Army from obeying the law of the land. Specifically, it prohibits the Secretary from complying with the Endangered Species Act. Let me explain. Like any other Federal agency, the Army Corps of Engineers has a legal obligation, under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, to operate in a way that does not jeopardize the existence of any endangered species. That's just common sense. After all, private landowners have to comply with the Endangered Species Act. Why should federal agencies get a free pass? They shouldn't. The federal government should do its part. That's why section 7 is a fundamental part of the ESA. Without section 7, the ESA would be unfair to private landowners and, in many cases, would provide no protection for endangered species whatsoever. Let's turn to the Missouri River. The river provides habitat for three endangered species: The pallid sturgeon, the piping plover, and the least interior tern. Accordingly, in developing its new master manual, which will govern the operation of the river, the Corps is legally required to propose a management approach that protects the habitat for these three species. Now, under section 7, when there's a pretty good chance that a federal agency's actions might jeopardize a species, the agency must consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service. That's the right approach. When it comes to the nuts and bolts of running a river system, the Corps is the expert. But, when it comes to the nuts and bolts of protecting a species, the Fish and Wildlife Service is the expert. No question. So, as it is legally required to do, the Corps has consulted with the Fish and Wildlife Service, initially under what's called the ``informal consultation process.'' There have been problems. Serious problems. When the Corps issued the first Environmental Impact Statement for the Master Manual, back in 1994, the Fish and Wildlife Service issued a draft opinion saying that, in it's judgment, the proposed operation would jeopardize the three species. In 1998, the Corps issued a revised EIS. Once again, the Fish and Wildlife Service said that, in it's judgment, the proposed operation still would jeopardize the three species. Then we made progress. On March 30 of this year, the Corps announced that it was entering into a formal consultation with the Fish and Wildlife Service and would rely on the Service's biological judgment to propose an alternative that does not jeopardize the species. In other words, it would fully comply with the ESA. We expect the Fish and Wildlife Service to issue it's biological opinion any day now. That opinion will explain, based on the best scientific information available, how to provide the needed protection for the recovery of the 3 endangered species on the river. Nobody outside the agency knows for sure what the biological opinion will say. But, based on all of the scientific discussion that's gone on so far, there's a good likelihood that it will require more releases of water in the spring, to maintain the instream flows necessary to provide habitat for the sturgeon, plover, and tern. That probably will mean fewer releases in the summer which, some will argue, could affect barge traffic downstream. That's where section 103 of the bill comes in. It prevents the Corps releasing more water in the spring. In other words, if the biological opinion comes out the way most folks expect it to, section 103 prevents the Corps from complying with the Endangered Species Act. So, again, this debate is not just about the allocation of water between upstream and downstream states. The debate is also, fundamentally, about whether, in one fell swoop, we should waive the application of the Endangered Species Act to one of the largest rivers in the country. The river, I might add, that is the wellspring of the history of the American west. I suggest that the answer is obvious. We should not. Mr. President, let me also respond to a point that some of the supporters of section 103 have made. They argue, in essence, that we've lost our chance. Sort of like the legal notion of estoppel. This provision has been in the bill for several years, they argue. We've never tried to delete it before. So, I suppose they're trying to imply, it's somehow inappropriate for us to raise it now. This argument is a red herring. A distraction. Up until now, we've never been in a situation in which there was an impending biological opinion under the endangered Species Act. So, by definition, the earlier provisions did not override the Endangered Species Act. What's more, in the absence of a biological opinion, there was no real likelihood that the Corps would implement a spring rise. So the provision was theoretical. Symbolic. It had absolutely no practical effect. Now, Mr. President, it most certainly will. That's why we are raising the issue. One final point. If we pass section 103, and the Corps is directed to operate the system in violation of the Endangered Species Act, there will be a lawsuit. That will have two effects. First, it will slow things down. Second, it may well put us in the position of having the river operated, in effect, by the courts rather than by the Corps. We've seen this happen along the Columbia Snake River system, and it's not been an easy experience for anyone. In closing, I suggest that there's a better way. After all, once a biological opinion is issued, there will be an opportunity for public comment, so this decision will not be made in a vacuum. In fact, there have been countless public meetings and forums on the revision of the Master Manual over the years. And that's as it should be. So let's not create a special exemption for the Corps. Let's require them to abide by the same law that we apply to everybody else. Let's allow the regular process to work. Let's allow the agencies to continue to consult and figure out how to strike the balance that's necessary to manage this mighty and beautiful river: for upstream states, for downstream states, and for the protection of endangered species; that is, for all of us.","word.count":1287,"sep11":-1.15449438202247,"years":2000.70505617978,"days":2031,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0669218430680237,"Topic 2":0.0289853952422342,"Topic 3":0.0338521136289872,"Topic 4":0.00824011780399949,"Topic 5":0.0393743661084565,"Topic 6":0.00728253202613909,"Topic 7":0.00852724538770129,"Topic 8":0.296067232025639,"Topic 9":0.49146710342021,"Topic 10":0.0192820512886087},{"id":"10519980020210","body":"Jerry Lewis: Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.

Vento: Mr. Chairman, almost all of the money in this bill that is being expended is for good purposes. The problem is not with what is in the bill, it is what is not in the bill, what is out of it. I am glad we are able to do something on community service, put $100 million in, but we take $1 billion out of LIHEAP. I am glad we are able to provide some money for education, but when someone says the Federal Government is the program, is the sum and total program for higher education, that is it. The nonprofits and others are running out. But the real problem is that beneath the veneer of fighting for fiscal discipline and budget balance, the policy path evoked by this measure will build upon the distorted priorities of the 1996 Republican appropriation effort, in sum, adding to the human deficit in this Nation, a human deficit which is borne by those with less power, the children, the working poor, the students, and those who struggle to achieve the promise of America. The opportunity to get ahead. Investment in people is our best American investment. It pays the greatest dividends. Yet this measure in the Republican-led House has repeatedly broken faith with our children, our workers, and, in reality, our American future. I urge my colleagues to oppose this measure for that reason. As a teacher, as a science educator, I understand. In my district, 25 percent of the kids are Southeast Asians. They need the bilingual education. They need the help so that they can achieve the type of success and the American dream that has been the promise, the renewed promise, of this Nation. But we cannot do it because we have put 7, 8, 9, $10 billion more into Pentagon spending, because we need to have tax breaks. What is wrong with this measure is that the money is going in other directions where it is not needed. I think it is more justified here. And if it is efficiencies and new definitions and all the other rhetoric that is going on here today in terms of what we are going to do, the fact is, the bottom line is the States are not capable of the miracle of loaves and fishes. So if we do not give them the dollars, we are going to hurt the people that we purport to be helping in this bill. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to the fiscal year 1997 Labor, Health and Human Services, Education appropriations bill being considered today. Investments in education, whether in our children or workers, determine a nation's standard of living and a country's ability to be competitive in the global marketplace. This legislation, like last year's spending bill, targets labor, education and job training programs for the most severe funding cuts. These types of programs, which invest in America's working families and children should not and must not be undermined. This legislation reduces funding for elementary and secondary education programs such as Title I, Safe and Drug Free Schools and bilingual education. The cut in title I funding is in addition to the funding freeze the program endured last year, which translated into a real cut for growing school districts. Title I provides students who are falling behind their classmates additional academic help. In my district in St. Paul, MN, the title I program cannot currently reach every student who needs such assistance. Reducing funding for this program would cause even more students to fall behind in their studies, and this type of policy has consequences that reach far beyond these students' school years into their post-academic lives. We cannot ignore some students, inhibiting their success, simply because they have difficulty learning. In the same regard, we also cannot ignore that today's school environment is becoming more violent and dangerous in many, especially but not solely urban, areas. The Safe and Drug Free Schools Program is one initiative, run in virtually every school district in the nation, working to fight that trend. However, the program after protracted debate over a 57 percent cut was finally level funded in last year's Republican budget, and the bill we are debating today proposes to reduce funding for this program by again $25 million in fiscal year 1997. This means that in fiscal year 1997, the Safe and Drug Free Schools Program will be funded at a level below its allocation in fiscal year 1995, at a time when the need for such drug, alcohol and violence preventative programs are dramatically increasing! One other population of students who will be hurt by this legislation is immigrant children. Funding for bilingual and immigrant education programs is set to be reduced by 11 percent in this spending bill. Multiethnic communities and schools will be hit especially hard since these schools must continue providing such services with less Federal help. Investing in the education of these children is important. These children should not be left out in the cold regarding educational opportunity, unable to improve their lives and become productive members of our society. The bill also takes aim at higher education, increasing funding for some student aid programs while eliminating or sparsely funding others. The measure modestly increases the maximum Pell grant award by $30; not enough for a book much less inflation but this bill does increase funding for the Work-Study Program. However, at the same time, the bill reduces Perkins Loan funding by 82 percent and eliminates the State Student Incentive Grant Program altogether. In a time when the cost of a higher education is skyrocketing, the need for such a degree is growing, and parents are less able to help with such expenses, we cannot afford to pull the financial rug out from under our Nation's students. The Federal Government is the lifeline of higher education funding, States and nonprofits are stretched to the limit, yet this Congress proposes to do less compounding and cutting off opportunity for 100,000 students. Today's workers could also lose the ability to acquire additional education and job training under this bill due to the lack of sufficient funding for such programs and services. This measure freezes spending on such programs at the fiscal year 1996 level. Our Nation benefits greatly from developing the skills and abilities of future generations of workers and allowing those workers to update that knowledge and skill. No amount of infrastructure, technology, or opportunity will help our Nation's workers and future workers if they are unable to meet the challenges of the world of work. Another drastic provision in this measure is the reduction in funding for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration [OSHA] by $6 million from the fiscal year 1996 level in this Republican spending bill. This funding is vital to workers, whose lives, health and safety are literally at risk on the job. Each year, thousands of workers are killed on the job and millions suffer disability related injuries. The National Safety Council estimates that work-related accidents and deaths cost the Nation over $100 billion every year. Cutting the budget of the principal public entity OSHA, that attempts to reduce that figure and increase workplace safety not only is a slap in the face to every American worker who puts their health and safety on the line, but also does not make fiscal sense. Furthermore, the National Labor Relations Board [NLRB] is targeted for a 15 percent cut when combined with funding cuts from last year. This proposed reduction would cripple the NLRB's ability to adjudicate labor disputes and appears to be yet another slap at working people who seek equitable wages and work conditions based upon worker rights promised in Federal law. I agree that we should work toward a balanced Federal budget, but there are many ways to achieve such a balance than abandoning the investments that America has long made in its working families. Not all of the cuts need to be made from people programs and surely the ideological mindset that guides these cuts cannot be glossed over by the rhetoric of budget balancing. The Pentagon, space programs, corporate welfare and natural resource giveaway are just some of the many Federal programs that should also be subject to fiscal discipline and tough choices. The price for reducing investments in America's people should not be new tax breaks for corporations and investors or increasing the defense budget to a greater level than that Department even requested. But this 104th Congress has acted repeatedly to insulate from shared sacrifice this laundry list of special interests and placed foremost for cuts the vital programs that affect health, education, job training, and the environment. This Labor, Health and Human Services, Education Appropriations measure for fiscal year 1997 continues the assault on working Americans and families that was so vigorously waged last year. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this measure and return our Nation to one that values all of its people. Beneath the veneer of fighting for fiscal discipline and budget balance, the policy path evoked by this measure would build upon the distorted priorities of the 1996 Republican appropriation effort, in sum, adding to the human deficit in this Nation. A human deficit which is borne by those with less power, the children, the working poor, the students and those who struggle to achieve the promise of America; the opportunity to get ahead. Investment in people is our best American investment; it pays the greatest dividends yet this measure and the Republican-led House has repeatedly broke faith with our children, our workers, in reality our American future. I oppose and urge Members to oppose this appropriation measure.","word.count":1617,"sep11":-5.3061797752809,"years":1996.55337078652,"days":553,"party":"Other","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.417727825068675,"Topic 2":0.278345021447092,"Topic 3":0.005324578218506,"Topic 4":0.108139595711345,"Topic 5":0.00763947194479268,"Topic 6":0.00348151730688153,"Topic 7":0.12665178941925,"Topic 8":0.014459182414635,"Topic 9":0.0190198539854246,"Topic 10":0.0192111644833983},{"id":"10419950049594","body":"William F.

The development of the Yellowstone and Grand Tetons National Parks winter use plan draft environmental impact statement has been a landmark exercise for inclusion and cooperation between state, local and Federal Agencies involved in the land management planning process. While this endeavor has not progressed without flaws, it has established that local and state governments possess the expertise and ability to respond in a timely and educated manner to address issues critical to the development of a comprehensive land-use document. In spite of these efforts, however, the United States Department of the Interior has announced a decision to usurp this process and has chosen to implement an outright ban on all snowmobiles, in virtually all national parks, including Yellowstone. I must admit I am not surprised at the over-reaching nature of this action. In fact, several months ago I predicted that the Park Service would ban snowmobiles in Yellowstone Park and would extend its ban on snowmobiles to all national parks. I am further concerned that this action will spread to include other public land including the national forests. In fact, discussions with National Forest supervisors surrounding Yellowstone indicate that all it will take is an adverse opinion by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to ban snowmobiles altogether. The United States Forest Service could claim that increased snowmobile use on our national forests will impact the Canadian lynx, or some other threatened or endangered species, without proof or documentation to put such a ban in place. After a ban in the forests, we can expect action on BLM lands. After snowmobiles, what next? A ban on automobiles and then even on bicycles? If that sounds farfetched, think back just three years ago when we were assured that snowmobiles would not be banned in Yellowstone Park. Soon, we may even expect that bans on other types of recreation will follow and our public lands will no longer be available to the public. As one of the Senators representing the bulk of Yellowstone, I feel it is my duty to correct some of the misconceptions that surround this proposal by the federal government to prohibit access to our nation's oldest and dearest of national parks. Millions of visitors come to Yellowstone National Park each year to experience first hand the park's unique and awesome beauty. They come from all over the world to see Earth's largest collection of geothermal features and to witness some of the largest free-roaming bison and elk herds in the United States. In a proposal announced March 24, 2000 the U.S. Department of the Interior declared its plan to permanently ban snowmobiles from the park beginning in 2002. This announcement was followed by a later statement, on April 27, 2000, where the Department of Interior expanded a proposed ban to dozens of other national parks across the country. If federal officials and national special interest groups have their way, however, a visit to Yellowstone National Park may become as rare and endangered as the trumpeter swan or black footed ferret. There is little evidence to support claims that this proposal was made to protect the environment or to reduce the impact on Park animals. In fact, later statements by park personnel indicate that the main reason for this ban was to comply with changing Park Service policy which was developed to supersede ongoing efforts to reach a reasonable compromise on national park winter use. As I stated earlier, the decision to ban snowmobiles was announced before the Park Service had completed its review of comments on a draft environmental impact statement created by the park and adjacent states and counties to address concerns over winter use in Yellowstone and its neighbor, Grand Teton National Park. The announcement also came before officials could incorporate revisions and amendments to major studies that the Park Service relied on in drafting the draft environmental impact statement. The Park Service admits these initial studies were seriously flawed and exaggerated snowmobile pollution estimates. The original draft study on snowmobile emissions erroneously computed emissions amounts using pounds instead of grams as is used to compute all standard emission amounts. So what is the real reason for banning snowmobiles from Yellowstone and all other national parks? The Park Service's proposal to ban snowmobiles is all about deciding who will have the privilege of experiencing the Park up close and in person, and who will be forced to stay home. Unfortunately, this will leave an even larger segment of the United States ignorant of how vast and wonderful our parks really are. It is vitally important, therefore, that a true picture be painted for the American public to understand what is really being taken away from them. One poll touted by national environmental organizations claims most Americans favor banning snowmobiles, partially based on an image of snowmobiles as heinous, smog producing, noisy devices used to run down poor, defenseless animals and lacking a conception of the size of the park and the limited number of snowmobiles accessing the park on any given day. The administration failed to inform the public of other alternatives to an outright ban that were in the works. For example: snowmobile manufacturers are interested in cleaner, quieter machines. There was also discussion about reducing the number of snowmobiles that could access the park every winter. Not many people realize that local leaders were very involved in trying to resolve the situation to avoid implementing a full fledged ban. In addition, the snowmobile industry has been working for several years to develop air and noise standards with the Environmental Protection Agency so there is a clear target for cleaner, quieter machines. Industry has stated time and time again that once they have clearly defined standards they will develop the technology to meet those standards One company even gave the Park Service some advanced model snowmobiles to test. Right now, snowmobiles are only allowed on groomed roads, the same roads used by cars in the summer and average less than two-thousand snowmobiles a day. A speed limit of 45 miles per hour is strictly enforced. Any driver who puts one ski off the designated trails is subject to fines and possible arrest. The same goes for speeding. This is a significant point to make by the way, because the Executive order this ban is based on regulates off-road vehicle use on our national parks, and as I just noted, snowmobiles are not off-road vehicles in national parks. What a snowmobile ban really does is deny access for old and young riders with physical limitations that preclude them from snowshoeing or cross country skiing into the park. The only alternative left for those visitors unable to snowshoe or ski into the park will only be able to access the park via a mass transit vehicle known as a snow coach. Because of its size, and the type of terrain, it is incredibly impractical to limit access to Yellowstone to just snow coaches or cross country skis and snowshoes. Yellowstone is made up of approximately 2.2 million acres, most of which is already closed to public access other than by foot, snow shoe or skis, and has less than 2,000 snowmobiles inside the park on any given day. By comparison, the State of Connecticut is slightly larger than Yellowstone Park with more than 3.3 million people, many of which drive a car every day. Perspective is important. On its face, and in the safety of your own living room, the idea of riding a van-sized, over snow vehicle may sound like a romantic mode of travel, but in reality, snow coaches are large, cumbersome vehicles that grind, scrape, and shake their way across high mountain passes. It is impossible to ride in a snow coach for long periods of time. As a result, the proposal to only access the park by means of mass transit further restricts time and access to the park by virtually eliminating all entrances to Yellowstone except for the gate at West Yellowstone, Montana. The terrain and elevation at Wyoming's East Gate is so rugged and high that it is impractical for snow coaches to travel in that area of the park. Sylvan Pass reaches an elevation of 8,530 feet and is surrounded by mountains that rise well over 10,000 feet on one side, and gorges with sheet drops of several thousand feet on the other. This is definitely not a place for a snow coach. Furthermore, by moving the southern access point from Flag Ranch to Colter Bay, the Park Service makes any southern day trip into Yellowstone an impossible 113 miles round trip. This also creates a serious safety problem for Idaho snow groomers who, in the past, filled up their gas tanks at Flag Ranch. Under the current proposal, these facilities will be closed and the groomers will not have enough gas to make one complete round trip. This creates a serious safety problem and shuts off access to more than 60 miles of non-Park Service trails. Once again, I would like to reiterate that the complete banning of snowmobiles is not the only available alternative for national park recreational winter use. For the past three years, I have worked with the communities surrounding Yellowstone to develop a more practical and more inclusive approach to Yellowstone winter use. After holding dozens of meetings with residents and business owners, we have been able to create a proposal that preserves the park's environmental health while at the same time ensuring future access--for everyone. This amendment will enable the Park Service to rethink its actions and hopefully incorporate a more positive approach to winter management.

Under these provisions, Americans are allowed access to U.S. products sold overseas at lower prices provided that those medicines, when reimported, are demonstrated to be safe and effective. At the time the Senate considered this appropriations bill, the Senate adopted an additional safeguard to protect consumer health and safety. By a vote of 96 to 0, the Senate agreed to an amendment which Senator Kohl and I offered to the amendment of Senator Jeffords to include the Medicine Equity and Drug Safety Act of 2000 on this bill. That amendment is retained in this conference report, and requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make two determinations before the changes to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, FFDCA, in section 745 can be implemented. The Secretary is required to demonstrate to the Congress that implementation will: pose no additional risk to the public's health and safety, and result in a significant reduction in the cost of covered products to the American consumer. As contained in section 745, section 804 enlists the expertise and conscience of the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make a specific and clear demonstration to assure these changes to the law will produce their intended result and do no unintended harm. In a written report to the Congress, the Secretary is to demonstrate the factual basis for his or her decision. That report should include relevant analysis and information that implementation of these changes in law will pose no additional risks to the American public's health and safety and will significantly reduce retail prices. After all, the motivation for these changes in law is to let U.S. drugs be brought back from Canada and other countries where they cost less, allowing these drugs to be available to individual American consumers at lower prices. If reimportation results primarily in profits for importers and does not result in a reduction in the price of drugs to American consumers, then the intent of these provisions is not achieved. I believe that with the additional safeguard provided by the original amendment adopted by the Senate, we can be more assured that this new drug reimportation system, if implemented, will not have adverse unintended effects on public health and safety and will achieve its intended result of making drugs more affordable for individual American consumers.","word.count":249,"sep11":-2.15730337078652,"years":1999.70224719101,"days":1674,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0894110184312084,"Topic 2":0.218836804305814,"Topic 3":0.0190823350113034,"Topic 4":0.148656058778276,"Topic 5":0.0680655222735245,"Topic 6":0.00224205703927286,"Topic 7":0.00925446873464025,"Topic 8":0.187381006700179,"Topic 9":0.0131344169813557,"Topic 10":0.243936311744427},{"id":"10419950133024","body":"Howell Heflin: Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Hal Self, who was recently selected as one of the 6 new inductees into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame for 1996.

Robert N. Giaimo was a profound figure in this body, someone who represented the values, the dreams and aspirations of the people he represented. For eleven terms he served the Third District of Connecticut that I am now honored to represent. And as a fellow child of Italian immigrants from North Haven, Connecticut, he did so with distinction, with honor and with special purpose. During his 22 years in the Congress, 1959 to 1980, his contributions were as momentous as they were numerous. Serving during a time of great upheaval in this country, it was Bob Giaimo who led the first successful effort to end funds for the fighting in Southeast Asia. He co-sponsored legislation that led to the creation of the National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities, unleashing the creative potential of millions of Americans. And when the Congress decide it was time to get control of the Federal budget process, they chose Bob Giaimo to chair that committee which he did with integrity for 4 years. Bob's priority was always making sure that the work that we did in the Congress, the programs and the funding impacted those who needed it most. Madam Speaker, the legacy of Congressman Robert Giaimo lives on today in his former staff, some of whom went on to serve in the Connecticut State legislature. It lives on in the people he served in our district for whom he made opportunity real. It lives on in his successors, in the work that I do in the Congress. Our thoughts and our prayers are with the family, his daughter, B.L., and his wife, Marion. Bob Giaimo was an inspiration to so many and we will miss him. Just very, very briefly, I can recall being 8 years old when Bob Giaimo went to visit my parents, Louise and Ted DeLauro. He said he was running for the United States Congress and would they support his effort as they were involved in politics as well. They did support that effort. He won the race. I have in my possession, in my family's possession, a letter saying thank you to Louise and Ted DeLauro for their help in getting him elected. He reached enormous heights, yet he never forgot where he came from.","word.count":388,"sep11":4.82303370786517,"years":2006.68258426966,"days":4159,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0904460121963251,"Topic 2":0.366490643537444,"Topic 3":0.23497184980501,"Topic 4":0.0261744477758568,"Topic 5":0.0421865521146378,"Topic 6":0.00637016968776456,"Topic 7":0.00258062819203385,"Topic 8":0.0786580772654112,"Topic 9":0.0113561058292222,"Topic 10":0.140765513596296},{"id":"10920060007857","body":"Jeff Miller: Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate the 58th birthday of the State of Israel.

The United States recognized Israel within 11 minutes of its creation as an independent nation; however, not all developments in Israel's infancy as a nation were welcome. Attacked in 1948 from all sides by surrounding Arab nations, Israel defeated its enemies but soon learned it would have to develop as a democratic nation while vigilantly patrolling its borders for foreign invaders. In addition to being a picturesque country located on the Mediterranean Sea, Israel is home to many religious sites that are sacred to people of the Muslim, Christian and Jewish faith. This concentration of Holy sites makes it all the more unfortunate that Israel and its people are the targets of so many terrorist attacks.

This rule makes in order four Democrat amendments and only three Republican amendments. This means that 80 percent of requested Democrat amendments were made in order, but just 33 percent, or one-third, of Republican amendments filed with the Rules Committee were made in order. Mr. Speaker, this isn't balanced. It's restrictive and not in the tradition of having an open debate on important issues. Last night at the Rules Committee, Financial Services Committee Chairman Frank said that he supported allowing debate on an amendment relating to illegal immigration and legitimate concerns of ensuring that persons illegally present in this country do not benefit from the new Federal program created by this bill. Rules Committee Democrats responded by making in order the least substantive, most meaningless and unenforceable immigration amendment possible. A Republican amendment by Representative Ginny Brown-Waite. of Florida had very clearly and explicitly made certain that anyone illegally present in this country cannot rent or buy a house from this new government program. That amendment was not made in order. Every Democrat on the Rules Committee voted to deny the House voting on this meaningful amendment. Mr. Speaker, when Democrat leaders aren't totally shutting down debate, they are giving the House window dressing instead of substance on important issues. Not content with blocking two-thirds of Republican amendments and restricting the opportunity of every Member of this institution to come to the House floor and offer amendments to improve, fix or alter this bill, House Democrat leaders went even further to shut down the minority, squelch dissent and take away their parliamentary rights. Section 2 of this rule takes away the right of any Member of this House to make a motion that the House rise out of the Committee of the Whole and places it solely in the hands of the Democrat majority leader or the Democrat chairman of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. Speaker, the new majority promised to run the most open, honest House in history. Instead of keeping their promises to the American people, Democrat leaders are acting with impunity as they shed any semblance of openness, fairness or regular order. I don't believe many of the freshmen Democrat Members who were elected in the last election came to Congress to block debate and prohibit Members from offering amendments on the House floor. Yet, Mr. Speaker, they have joined lock-step with Speaker Pelosi in stooping to a level of oppressive partisanship that far exceeds the sins of any previous Congresses. It's a shameful record that shatters the promise Democrat leaders made to the American people to run an open, honest House. Mr. Speaker, all this is being done to pass a bill that would create a brand new, Big Government, $15 billion Federal program to buy, remodel, resell or rent thousands and thousands of houses across the country. Who will profit from this new $15 billion government program are the lenders who made the bad loans and then foreclosed on families who didn't make their mortgage payments. It's a bailout for home lenders that knowingly took risks. It's terribly unwise and wasteful of taxpayer dollars to create a new government program that invites other lenders to take gambles on home loans because the American taxpayer will come along and wipe away their bad decisions. Mr. Speaker, why should American taxpayers be footing the bill for calculated mistakes made by others? Why should American taxpayers, who are making their mortgage payments each month or who are paying rent, have to come along and fund billions of dollars to give away grants and zero interest loans for those who speculated, gambled and lost? Mr. Speaker, taxpayers should not take this hit. Now I recognize that this bill is titled the Neighborhood Stabilization Act and that its stated intent is to help rehabilitate neighborhoods in metropolitan cities and urban communities that have multiple foreclosed homes sitting vacant and empty. But, Mr. Speaker, why should rural and middle America be forced to have their tax dollars used to bail out lenders in big cities and urban areas? I believe, Mr. Speaker, we should work to find incentives for people to purchase these homes and improve these neighborhoods. But we should oppose a new $15 billion spending program so the Federal Government can be involved in flipping houses or renting out homes. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this oppressive rule and the bad underlying bill. With that, I reserve the balance of my time.","word.count":768,"sep11":6.82584269662921,"years":2008.68539325843,"days":4872,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.14390563051985,"Topic 2":0.222275306266941,"Topic 3":0.01774888544719,"Topic 4":0.00318030181378776,"Topic 5":0.0784499572667895,"Topic 6":0.519535978566461,"Topic 7":0.0035345594630083,"Topic 8":0.00562171776811345,"Topic 9":0.00405389409992697,"Topic 10":0.0016937687879319},{"id":"10820040026732","body":"Thad McCotter: Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Mexico . As a member of the Committee on International Relations, Subcommittee on the Middle East, I would like to thank the gentlewoman from Florida for bringing into the committee some victims who had survived Saddam Hussein's brutality so we could personally hear from them. They also had with them a documentary filmmaker, Mr. Janos, who showed excerpts of his film interviewing survivors, the grieving mothers and widows of Saddam Hussein's executioners. It is not often that we truly get a chance to plumb the unfathomable depths of human pain, but I believe we experienced that in committee yesterday. We had a chance to see a grieving mother whose husband was killed, whose children were killed, saying she would never laugh again in her lifetime, and praying to God for a short life and a merciful death so she could forget. We saw a mother break down because she remembered the cries of her child in a cell, a 6 year old, crying out that he had no milk, he was hungry. Well, he is gone and she remains to grief. We had a Mr. Ibraham and a Mr. Taimor. They were both testaments to the evil of the Iraqi dictator. Mr. Ibraham, a Shiite, had been chased through that country, arrested several times, housed in Abu Ghraib prison, and was so shocked by what he experienced there he could not speak about it, especially about what happened to the women. We also saw Mr. Taimor who had been shot by Iraqi executioners in front of a mass grave and while bleeding had to crawl out. We in this country hear much from many that Iraq was a mistake. I ask one thing of those people, I ask them to say it to those victim's faces. We hear the hippocrits in this country say that Saddam was a bad man, but the United States should not have taken him from power. I ask them to say that to the Iraqi victims' faces. For those people who believe America is the greatest threat to peace in the world, I ask them never to show their faces in public again. Whether we like it or not, what we are seeing internationally is a clash of revolutions. It is a clash of revolutions that is fought not upon maps but upon minds. It is the American revolution of freedom for the individual and republican forms of democracy and private enterprise that chased every king from Europe or put them on the dole, that has chased imperial Japanese forces and put a democracy in place, and the world is better. We have seen the Philippines that we once annexed and helped bring into a stable democracy, and throughout the globe we see people trying to emulate the freedom and opportunity we have here. Yet the second revolution, which is lot upon many, is the Iranian revolution, a revolution of extremism and totalitarianism perverting the peaceful tenets of Islam to accomplish political objectives. Right now our revolutions meet in Iraq. That is why those in this country who do not think deeply about this believe we can retreat from Iraq and that the only consequence will be the United States will have to act multilaterally. The reality is we cannot retreat because unless freedom and democracy are established on the borders of the Iranian revolution, the Iranian revolution will continue to be exported through means both traditional and terrorist. The stakes have never been greater. I know it is very difficult for many to remember that we are and remain the seminal revolutionary country, and that in many ways it is hard to admit we are a moral force for good in this world, and that absent the United States, what would the world be like. Well, we might have trouble remembering that, but when I had the chance to ask the victims of Saddam if they thought any other country on the face of the earth could or would save them from his butchery, their answer was no, only the United States could do that. Only the United States would do that. I asked them if they thought it was a mistake, and they said no, that they believe we were a great and a good country for helping to save them. So as we engage in the debate through now and the election and perhaps throughout the remainder of our lives, let us remember what is at stake, the clash of revolutions. Either we will prevail or we will be defeated, and if we are defeated, as President Lincoln said, we will lose the last best hope of earth.","word.count":784,"sep11":2.93539325842697,"years":2004.79494382022,"days":3487,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0857687719823517,"Topic 2":0.109844257417163,"Topic 3":0.0111362589452932,"Topic 4":0.657122449511273,"Topic 5":0.00108720801263111,"Topic 6":0.0325795272883956,"Topic 7":0.0126916730456465,"Topic 8":0.00633528934036265,"Topic 9":0.0662493890213938,"Topic 10":0.0171851754354892},{"id":"10419960040110","body":"Doug Bereuter: Mr. Speaker, this Member is pleased to support H.R 3852, the Methamphetamine Control Act. Methamphetamine is a powerful drug that is relatively easy to manufacture. The use of this dangerous drug is escalating rapidly due to its low cost and highly addictive qualities. Methamphetamine use is expanding into the Midwest. According to the Nebraska State Patrol, in 1991, Nebraska had 25 arrests for possession of methamphetamine or delivery. In 1995, there were 374 methamphetamine arrests. This is a 350-percent increase. Communities along the I-80 corridor are the hardest hit. The severity of the problem in Nebraska was highlighted last spring by the tragic death of a teenager in York, NE, at his prom from an overdose of methamphetamine. It was a shock and wake-up call to this prototypical county seat community of 7,500 and to all of Nebraska. The Methamphetamine Control Act increases penalties for trafficking and manufacturing methamphetamine substances or other materials used to produce methamphetamines. It appropriately establishes mandatory minimum sentences for methamphetamine trafficking. For trafficking 5 to 49 grams of the drug there will be a 5-year minimum sentence. The bill requires a 10-year minimum sentence for trafficking 50 or more grams. These new penalties are crucial to efforts to decrease the availability of this dangerous and proliferating drug. In closing, Mr. Speaker, we must pass this bill in the short time left in this session of Congress. It must also be passed by the Senate with these tough but appropriate sentencing provisions so that it can be sent to the President for signature. The Nation must become serious and effective in combating this very serious problem. This bill must become law this year in order to do all we can to fight the use of this dangerous drug.","word.count":292,"sep11":-5.08988764044944,"years":1996.76966292135,"days":630,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0959873480497104,"Topic 2":0.13215281379536,"Topic 3":0.00585536846960796,"Topic 4":0.0482352016047987,"Topic 5":0.00521652701149339,"Topic 6":0.00468308534181439,"Topic 7":0.683769407428829,"Topic 8":0.007218812424675,"Topic 9":0.0129140933904489,"Topic 10":0.00396734248326226},{"id":"10820030059608","body":"Ted Stevens: Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his eloquent statement.

This legislation evolved out of Congressman Hansen's personal trials and tribulations of trying to cancel his own Private Mortgage Banking Insurance. And Representative Hansen's testimony before the committee defined the problem and the solution. Think of this as a ``Consumer Bill of Rights.'' Private Mortgage Insurance is both an important but little understood instrument in the current mortgage industry. PMI enables families to purchase homes with as little as a 3-5 percent downpayment by insuring the mortgage lender against default. In 1996, more than 1 million people bought or refinanced a home with PMI. It made homeowners out of more than 16 million families. PMI is normally required whenever a borrower does not have a 20- percent downpayment. PMI costs homeowners between $20 to $100 per month and protects the lender against the risk of loss on low-downpayment loans. PMI can be canceled under certain conditions, when a good payment history is met and 30 percent or more is achieved on the cost of the home. The problem arises when homeowners are not informed of what PMI is and when and how they can stop paying it. Overpayment of PMI is potentially costing hundreds of thousands of homeowners millions of dollars per year. Passage of this bill will ensure that homeowners will be better equipped to understand what PMI is, who it insures, and what rights the homeowner has to cancel it. This legislation requires automatic termination of private mortgage insurance after the homeowner attains a certain equity level in his or her home. In addition, the bill would require the mortgage companies and financial institutions that originate and service mortgages provide homeowners with information on the terms and conditions of PMI and how it can be canceled, both voluntarily and by law. It is time to correct this problem and to stop overcharging the consumer. This is good public policy and I urge my colleagues to support it.","word.count":346,"sep11":-3.24438202247191,"years":1998.61516853933,"days":1287,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.169885044060734,"Topic 2":0.223671360413267,"Topic 3":0.00665851877547644,"Topic 4":0.0213419259224143,"Topic 5":0.119234521245451,"Topic 6":0.0108627535200586,"Topic 7":0.398942671020836,"Topic 8":0.0379474245478466,"Topic 9":0.00599407247551447,"Topic 10":0.0054617080184022},{"id":"10419960039548","body":"Roger F.

Res 530, a bill that makes a strong statement of advocacy for human rights and urges the People's Republic of China to adhere to the principles of international law and respect for the fundamental human rights of individuals. This bill is timely in light of the equally urgent crisis that occurs today in Haiti. We must work to ensure that all of our international neighbors uphold the principles of international law. On July 9th of last year, I participated in a rally held on the Capitol lawn to uphold justice and freedom for the practitioners of the Falun Gong religion. As I stood that day to support the practitioners of Falun Gong and their unwarranted persecution, I stand today to request that Congress must insist that China adheres to worldwide standards on human rights and toleration. We as a nation have a unique relationship with the People's Republic of China, and we must take every action to maintain and foster that relationship. Yet we cannot overlook the injustices committed in that nation. The persecution of the Falun Gong, an organization whose three principles are truthfulness, compassion, and tolerance, is a prime example of that very injustice I speak of. I must preempt my statement by clarifying that this bill will not serve to diminish the strength of our two great nations' relationship; rather it will cultivate an environment of peace and regional security. This bill will send the People's Republic of China a clear message that it must alter its current position on Human rights in order to be a true member of the world community. As one of our largest trading partners our relationship with China has become closer then ever. We are constantly building new bridges of communication; politically, socially, and economically. Yet we cannot be content with these developments. We cannot sit idly by while China forces women to abort their children and imprisons people based on their religious beliefs. The World Community has set general principles for human rights. The simple fact is that China is not meeting these standards. The fear of change and diversity has infected the minds of those who are in a position to wield power and physical strength. The situation will not change until we take a clear position condemning China for its human rights abuses. Because of our unique relationship with the People's Republic of China we have a strong footing upon which to make these claims. By working with China, with the explicit goals of improving human rights conditions in that country, we can make China a better, safer country and create a new and stronger relationship between the United States and China. Our demands that China meet internationally accepted levels for human rights will not serve to hinder China's development, rather it will enable China to flourish. I will end by saying that we as Americans have a duty to stand up for those who are less fortunate, for those who voices are forced into silence, and for those shackled down by tyranny. We espouse and will constantly fight for human rights, freedom of speech, and freedom of religion in this country as well as internationally. Join me in supporting H.

This is a bill that will reauthorize the Promoting Safe and Stable Families Program, legislation that I have worked on since its creation in 1997. I am proud to join my colleagues Senators Grassley, Baucus, Hatch and Snowe in support of this bill. Chairman Grassley deserves our deep thanks and gratitude for real leadership on this legislation and a truly bipartisan process. The Finance Committee has a strong history of bipartisanship on child welfare and foster care. And I should note that this bipartisanship is palpable at the staff level as well and the fine staff of the Finance Committee also deserve our thanks for making this agreement possible. The children at risk of abuse and neglect in their own homes are among our most vulnerable children. Over the years, progress has been made to promote each child's safety, health and need for a permanent, safe home. But with 518,000 in foster care, there is clearly more work to be done for our children. The 2006 Deficit Reduction Act included an additional $40 million per year provided for the Promoting Safe and Stable Families Program. Our legislation will target this new money to clear needs for our child welfare system. One priority will be to create new competitive grants to support regional partnership to combat methamphetamine, ``meth,'' or other drug abuses that are affecting the child welfare system. Meth is devastating areas in West Virginia and around our country. When law enforcement breaks up a home meth lab, child welfare workers are often needed on site to deal with the children as their parents are taken to jail. Such children have been exposed to toxins and are at risk of having been abused or neglected when their parents were high on meth. Substance abuse is a huge problem for families in the child welfare system, but there is hope that prevention and treatment can help. Family-based comprehensive long term treatment facilities are reporting some impressive results in helping children and families. Other innovative court projects and law enforcement programs are being developed. This bill invests real dollars to promote and evaluate the most effective programs. The other priority of this legislation will be to make new investments to help states achieve what is considered the best practice of having monthly caseworker visits to 90 percent of the children in foster care. This standard helps improve outcomes for our most vulnerable children, and it is a worthy goal. The bill will also reauthorize and expand the Mentoring Children of Prisoners Program, created in 2002 as part of the reauthorization. The expansion is a 3-year pilot program to use vouchers as a new delivery mechanism for services in the hope of helping children in rural and underserved areas. Three States, West Virginia, Vermont and Utah, do not have any Mentoring Children of Prisoners grants, but there are children living there and in rural areas who need a mentor. Under the voucher program, qualified mentoring programs in local communities could get funding to serve such children. This is worth trying as a new model. Earlier this year, I hosted a roundtable in Beckley, WV on adoption, foster care and child welfare. I met with a judge, local officials and parents involved in our system. I heard an inspiring story of a young man who was adopted from foster care and has become a spokesperson for other children. Following this roundtable, it was very clear to me that we need to provide support and services to families in the system, and this new legislation should help. For years, I have worked with my colleagues to try and improve our child welfare system and foster care. This bill is our next step forward. Its costs have been offset, and the priorities of combating meth and substance abuse, as well as more caseworker visits are goals that we all can rally to support. My hope is that this bill will provide the incentives and push for West Virginia and every state to do more for our most vulnerable children.","word.count":610,"sep11":3.92977528089888,"years":2005.7893258427,"days":3841,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.00950859601069708,"Topic 2":0.524055450384313,"Topic 3":0.0273876521770748,"Topic 4":0.00885194595862193,"Topic 5":0.0398801822184856,"Topic 6":0.00545632696219586,"Topic 7":0.00750684535669016,"Topic 8":0.225174535446076,"Topic 9":0.133366742870322,"Topic 10":0.0188117226155244},{"id":"10820040036587","body":"Sheila Jackson-Lee: Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman for his remarks. It is worth hearing each of my colleagues characterize what will really be in the annals of the history pages of this body, and I think all of us came to the floor tonight just to make sure that the story was not misinterpreted, because after every election there are defeats. There are winners and losers and most of the articles are written in the first week and then nothing else is said, and oh, those guys lost. I thought it was very important that the Texas delegation come tonight to be able to say that those guys did not lose. If anybody lost, this body lost, America lost and Texas lost, and I will take just a moment myself to add just a few points into the record, as all my colleagues have indicated in calling each of their names. So I just simply want to say to Martin Frost, thank him for being the political moderate but having the balance, along with his great influence on the Committee on Rules, and I might say that any Member in this body that has ever had an opportunity to go to the Committee on Rules, the powerful Committee on Rules, knows the value of Martin Frost's insight and encouragement and questioning to make a bill better or to be able to see the reason in what you offered so that the others who are in the room might be able to join in his reason and vote for good amendments to make bills better. We thank him for that. We thank him for coming as our leader in the delegation week after week, leading us and guiding us around very important issues, and might I say, for those of us who came in the last decade, I believe that we were dealing with the redistricting issue for at least 8, 10 years as it relates to the constituents. Everybody says the Member, but it was the constituents, and those of my colleagues who are here tonight recall the hearings that were held around the State of Texas. Thousands upon thousands of witnesses came forward and said they did not want any changes. So it is not that we are speaking here tonight for these colleagues. Their constituents, voters, who are our bosses, told them that they wanted no changes, but one manipulated the system, refused to listen to the people. I remember a witness coming up and saying, is anybody going to listen to us? Does anybody want to do what we said or asked them to do? This is just a voter, a witness, that waited hours in the hearing room to testify before the State Senate, hours into the night. I think it was 1:00 a.m. Is anybody going to listen to us? So, Martin, we thank you for understanding that representation belongs to the people, and when you engaged in redistricting, you realized it was to make the people whole and to make them large. Thank you, also, Martin, for taking this very terrible crisis that we had of violence in schools and helping to organize the Bipartisan Youth Task Force Against Violence that I sat on. Thank you for doing that and making a difference. Charlie Stenholm, 26 years of service in the House and to Texas and to the Nation. I have just got to say one thing. It is this House, the gentleman from Texas said it. He called it the People's House. We like to say that in debate. I believe it is known in that manner through history and through the concept of the Founding Fathers. They wanted people to be different in this body. Charlie Stenholm is a farmer. I mean, he grows cotton. He understands farming and ranching, and he understands a large portion of this Nation that really believes they have been left out, the farmers of America, the ranchers of America, people that maybe some of us only know about because of what we consume. It is important to note that this is an $80 billion industry in Texas, and look what happened? Because of reckless disregard for the people of Texas and even for this House, an ill-conceived plan now found a man that had been elected in what was really a very conservative district, some might say a Republican district, had been elected over and over again because those people understood that he was their servant. Now we have lost that expertise, and as I indicated, just 24 hours ago we were on this floor listening to his reason about how can we raise the debt again, how can we allow the numbers to go up even higher. Of course, we will lose that voice. Thank you, Charlie, for, as was said by colleagues, having a pure sense of what is right and never wavering from it. Let me also thank Nick Lampson. As many of my colleagues know, he is my neighbor in Houston, and I was there. We were all sort of caught up in the tragedy of the loss of this precious little 12 year old as Nick was just coming to Congress, and I do not know what struck him. I remember the specifics of it. He left Congress and went and joined the search for this very dear, little girl, something like the gentleman from Texas said, none of us can even mouth the words of losing a child. So he joined the search, and I guess out of that came the inspiration of putting forward the Missing and Exploited Children's Caucus. He has been in conferences. He has spoken. He has put it on the map. He has been about the business of organizing communities around the idea of being against child abduction, and the caucus has over 130 members. It really has made a mark in its effort to fight against child pornography and many, many other issues. So we thank him for that. He introduced the Bring Our Children Home Act with a 103 original cosponsors, and he really made this something that is clearly a mark that will not be forgotten on this Congress. We thank him for that. We all know that Ciro Rodriguez is called the nice guy, but he is a nice guy, but he is a tough guy on the issues that are, in fact, close to his heart. Here is a guy that I would see on the floor of the House night after night after night, chairman of the Hispanic Caucus, but he was on the floor talking about health care, not only for Hispanics but for Americans, and he was always talking about it for children. He chaired the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Health Task Force, but he took it very seriously. I traveled with him. I saw him traveling around the country, going to summits on the question of health care and recognizing that we have 44 million Americans without health coverage, and he got up all the time and said how can we do this. Thank you, Ciro. He fought to raise the attention on diabetes and HIV/AIDS and substance abuse and mental health, and he led the fight in Washington for Hispanic health awareness, and so we cannot thank him enough. He is a guy with a big heart. I guess it is that social work degree that he has, and we simply thank you, Ciro, and your wife for working to make the NIH better, helping to get more moneys to the NIH and certainly helping to put the focus of health care improvement in Hispanic Americans clearly on the map. We thank you so very much. He has been called many things, but he was awarded the Community Superhero Award, and that speaks to Ciro in the words that he has done and what he has done on this floor as it relates to health care. Max Sandlin, someone said, is the lawyer's lawyer. I remember it is a shame that we do not do what the gentleman from Texas said and just meet right here in the middle because Max was a former judge, and the only thing that he wanted us to do was to be pure in our debate. If we had some issues about the law or legal procedures, he did not want us to politicize it, scapegoat lawyer, scapegoat injured individuals who have no other way of addressing their grievances, people who have been damaged by the Food and Drug Administration, poor quality drugs or someone's child has been on a playground and fallen down because the equipment does not work properly or some other product liability issue. He wants to get to the core element, debate the merits, and he brought forth some of the most crafted, thoughtful legislation dealing with balancing the rights of consumers and others that may be concerned about the costs of litigation. He was always here, not to be carrying forth the message of the single thought of trial lawyers, our friends, of course, who helped protect many Americans, but he was prepared to craft very intelligent legal arguments. It is a shame that we could not meet right here in the middle of the floor for Max Sandlin's very, very articulate, and well- thought-out legislative initiatives could not be heard. He spoke very clearly that as a judge he understood what justice was all about, and I will always admire and respect him for his leadership, his work with the Democratic Children and Health Task Forces, again his very defined work on the Committee on Ways and Means, a new Member that he was, but still a Member that was prepared to tackle those hard issues on Medicare and the legal liability issue of Medicare. You could always count on Congressman Max Sandlin to explain to you and get the legal liability issue out and make the bill better to serve all of us, and I thank him for that. Let me thank Jim Turner. I had the pleasure of serving with Jim Turner, and I met Jim Turner in Crockett, Texas. He was the mayor of Crockett. I knew him has a long-standing public servant. They loved him in Crockett, Texas, he and his family, his wife. He loved them, and lo and behold he comes to be a senator out of the Senate in Texas, and then he comes here to the United States Congress. He did not come here to think that he was going to be the ranking member on the Select Committee on Homeland Security. He did not come here knowing what would happen on 9/11, but I tell my colleagues what happened when he got to get that position, as he, even in the knowledge of having to retire because there was no district for him, he did not sit down. Chairman of the Blue Dog Coalition, many who may not know the Blue Dogs, the Yellow Dogs, the Blue Dogs had a different perspective.

McGovern: I thank the Chair The bill before us places some simple but highly effective safeguards on the Government's surveillance program. These safeguards will in no way impede our efforts to defeat the terrorist networks and prevent attacks on Americans. I want to highlight a few provisions of the bill that the Intelligence Committee reported, and which are at the center of our debate this week. These provisions require the FISA Court and Congress to play a greater role in overseeing the Nation's surveillance program. I should say a greater role and an appropriate role in overseeing the Nation's surveillance program. First, the FISA reauthorization will require the FISA Court to review the administration's procedures for determining that the targeted surveillance is reasonably believed to be outside the United States. Second, the FISA Court must review the procedures for minimizing the identities of and information about Americans incidentally detected during the surveillance of foreign targets. Third, the court must approve or disapprove the targeting of Americans overseas under this new authority on an individual basis, based on its review of whether there is probable cause to believe the person is an agent of a foreign power. Fourth, the bill includes a 6-year sunset to allow Congress to evaluate how the new authorities are carried out, and to ensure abuses do not occur before authorities are extended further. The threats and technologies are changing so fast that Congress will need to update the legislation during that time. Finally, the bill requires the intelligence community to conduct an annual review and requires detailed semiannual reports to be submitted to the House and Senate Intelligence and Judiciary Committees concerning collections authorized under the bill, including instances of noncompliance. These provisions represent a dramatic improvement to our Nation's international surveillance program, and I am pleased they are the foundation of the bill. But we can do more to strengthen the bill and do better to enforce the rule of law. I support Senator Cardin's amendment, which I cosponsored, to have a 4-year sunset for the bill rather than 6 years. If we learn of problems in the program, if the technologies continue to change or if the threat changes, we should have the opportunity to change the law. Over the coming days, we will also debate how to handle the question of immunity for companies that participated in the warrantless surveillance program from 2001 until 2007. In my view, if a company was knowingly acting in violation of existing law, the courts should review their actions to determine if there was wrongdoing. If, however, the Attorney General or an intelligence agency approached that company, and the company clearly tried to follow the law and act in good faith, it should not be held liable. That is why I am cosponsoring Senator Feinstein's amendment which establishes an independent process for reviewing whether a company should receive immunity. Under this amendment, the FISA Court would follow a three-step process for determining whether a lawsuit has merit. Senator Feinstein has proposed a smart and fair solution to this very difficult problem. The FISA reauthorization has become unnecessarily politicized, in my view. We are fully able to strengthen our Nation's international surveillance capabilities while protecting the privacy of Americans. I hope the Members of this Chamber can put the rhetoric and threats aside and move forward to assure that America is, in fact, protected, both in terms of threats against them in violence from terrorists and at the same time that we protect their civil liberties. I hope we can pass the FISA bill soon. I hope the President will do what is right and sign it.

But, this amendment would allow for waivers across the board in 16 States without any idea of what is in these waivers. I point out to my colleagues, that the administration has approved a record 67 waivers in 40 States. We've reduced welfare by 1.3 million people. The food stamp rolls are down. We are heading in the right direction. Today, however, we are debating a national welfare reform program. That should be our focus. The sense-of-the-Senate resolution that would approve waivers to 16 States without any idea what is in those waivers, I think is wrong, with all due respect. We don't have any idea what sort of impact these waivers will have on children, Mr. President. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by my colleague from Tennessee. I am uneasy about this amendment because it would express the sense of the Congress that 16 welfare waivers should be approved, without us knowing what those waivers propose to do. The President already has approved a record 67 welfare reform waivers in 40 States. That's quite a record. Welfare caseloads are down by 1.3 million people, food stamp rolls are lower, and child support collections are up. So a lot of progress has been made in recent years, States are experimenting, and we're debating a national welfare reform bill. I think we'd all like to see the passage of a bipartisan welfare reform bill that puts people to work and protects children. But this amendment asks us to give our approval to 16 different welfare plans without the benefit of knowing exactly what they propose to do. In my view, it should make us uneasy to approve 16 plans without knowing what the impact would be on the children in those States. Mr. President, my understanding is that in one of the State waivers, the State asks to set a 5-year lifetime limit on welfare benefits that would begin in 1987. That's a retroactive time limit. If this is true, a mother who had been off assistance for the last 4 years, but lost her job by no fault of her own, would be told she could have no assistance at all. What would happen to her children? We don't know, because the details of the plan do not accompany the amendment before us today. I understand that another waiver would terminate food stamp benefits if a mother does not comply with the work program. Now I know my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have argued that kids won't be hurt by welfare reform after the time limit, because food stamps are still there. Not under this sort of waiver as far as I can tell. So Mr. President, I urge caution on this amendment.

But, to accommodate this Senator and the time constraints that I have this afternoon, I wish to make a few appropriate remarks about why, in my opinion, we should not adopt the amendment that is going to be offered by the Senator from North Dakota. Mr. President, this amendment seeks to change the way mergers are handled by curtailing the current ICC rail merger review process. Under the current process, and the process in the bill before us--the bill by the chairman of the committee and this Senator from Nebraska-- the so-called Intermodal Surface Transportation Board will approve, disapprove, or condition rail mergers based on the public interest standard currently used by the ICC, not a narrow, Department of Justice-type of antitrust analysis. The public interest standard--which is part of the bill offered by the chairman of the committee and myself--allows the board to weigh the public benefits of a merger against its competitive harms. This standard allows the board to condition and approve mergers that are in the public interest even though they might violate some of the existing antitrust laws. This review has served my farmers, the farmers of South Dakota, and other farmers as well. This concept must be kept as part of our overall transportation network if we want it to run efficiently, especially with regard to rural areas. The current process provides for the input of the Department of Justice. Let me repeat that. The bill before us, the Pressler-Exon bill, provides for the input of the Department of Justice. This amendment goes beyond that and gives the Department of Justice the final say--or the veto, if you will--on rail mergers. Even though a merger might be approved by the Board because it is in the public interest, is protection of captive shippers, and is in the best interest of the transportation system, the Department of Justice with all of the lawyers, or some other third party, could still bring suit and force divestiture based on antitrust laws under the Dorgan amendment that is going to be proposed. Mr. President, this amendment erodes the jurisdiction of the Commerce Committee, and the new ISTB board because it invests too much authority in the Department of Justice. Lawyers are a very important part of our society, depending on your point of view. It seems to me, Mr. President, that, if we are going to turn the Department of Justice into a veto authority which they did not have under the Interstate Commerce Commission and take away the independent functioning of the board that we are setting up with the Pressler-Exon measure in the Department of Transportation, we are taking a significant step backward. I see nothing whatsoever wrong with the Department of Justice being the lawyer-adviser to the new board that is created. They should be consulted as to whether or not there is a serious violation of antitrust laws. But customarily in business, in my experience in business, and my experience as an individual, I have never let my lawyer make decisions for me. I consult with my lawyer, if I need one. I listen to his counsel and advice as to what is right [[Page S 17585]] and what is wrong. But I think the decision has to rest with me. Likewise, for the newly independent board that is created under the Pressler-Exon bill, which vests in a new department under the Department of Transportation, we do not need to hamstring that board and their efforts with regard to what should and should not be done with regard to mergers. So I hope if the amendment offered by the Senator from North Dakota comes to a vote the Senate will overwhelmingly oppose it. The Senator from North Dakota was involved in a similar effort with regard to the FCC legislation wherein he and some others felt that the Department of Justice should have the final say so in matters before the Federal Communications Commission. That measure was turned down overwhelmingly by the U.S. Senate because, if we have supposedly independent operating boards, such as the Federal Communications Commission, they should not be hamstrung or dictated to by the Department of Justice. It seems logical as to why we should not accept the amendment being offered by the Senator from North Dakota because it would essentially do the same thing that the Senate voted down with regard to the Federal Communications Commission. Therefore, I hope that we will give these new independent boards the authority that they obviously need to make decisions based upon the public interest. If turned over to the Justice Department, I believe that too much of the decisions would be made on legal technicality rather than that it is in the best interest of the public, in this case transportation, especially with regard to small States. I yield the floor.","word.count":836,"sep11":-5.93820224719101,"years":1995.92134831461,"days":328,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.128917227113991,"Topic 2":0.0146695150949142,"Topic 3":0.243800321801419,"Topic 4":0.354927215263795,"Topic 5":0.00586237786301949,"Topic 6":0.032857560027373,"Topic 7":0.00406705772488621,"Topic 8":0.120326930083013,"Topic 9":0.0145750670846814,"Topic 10":0.0799967279429077},{"id":"10519980059607","body":"James Jeffords: Mr. President, the Senate is resuming consideration of the Workforce Investment Partnership Act, S. 1186. This legislation incorporates job training, vocational education, and adult education. Last Friday, the Senate began debate on S. 1186. Amendments by Senators DeWine, Domenici, Lautenberg, and Ashcroft were adopted and made a part of this substitute. We have only today to have the final vote on the legislation, and we have 1 hour equally divided for that purpose. The legislation before this body today is one of the most important proposals we will consider this year. S. 1186 proposes a streamlined, practical, business-oriented approach to job training which empowers States with the ability to transform the current patchwork of programs into a comprehensive system. The purpose of this bill is to better coordinate and to consolidate in certain circumstances 90 federally funded programs and promote joint partnerships between education leaders in the business community in developing a workforce development system that is first rate. Perhaps the best illustration of why we need to revamp our workforce system can be clearly seen on a weekly basis in the want-ad sections of the newspapers throughout the Nation. There are presently 190,000 unfilled positions in the technology field. The reason for the difficulty in filling these positions is not because of low unemployment numbers but because of the lack of skilled workers. Many of these jobs do not require 4 years plus postsecondary education. In fact, if we had the proper high school vocational education system, these could be filled by students graduating from high school. They require an excellent vocational education system and the ability to pursue technical education following high school graduation or receive this education as high school students. One of the most fascinating facts to come out of the Senate Labor Committee's hearings on the workforce is that Malaysia has replicated our tech-prep model. In other words, we have presently a model system with a few schools using it which, if duplicated throughout this country, could provide us with what we need today. The unusual thing is that in this country it takes us a long time to replicate anything through our school systems. Malaysia came over here, studied our Tech- Prep Program, and went back to Malaysia and implemented it overnight-- again, moving them into a position to improve their competitiveness and perhaps exceed our own competitiveness. That is the kind of challenge we have now had delivered to us by our competitors in the international markets. It is up to us to take the steps necessary to ensure that we can meet the international competition which we are facing and not have 190,000 jobs out there begging because we cannot provide the skilled workforce. Fifteen years ago, ``A Nation At Risk'' was published and warned us about this problem. This report posed the question as to whether the United States would have an adequately trained workforce to meet the global challenges of the 21st century. Fifteen years later, here is what we have. According to the latest census information, 22 percent of the population in the United States aged 25 and over have completed less than 12 years of schooling. These are the kinds of problems with which we are faced. A most recent national adult literacy survey indicated that 44 million adults have literacy difficulty. This means that over 20 percent of adults in this country have trouble using reading, writing, and computation skills to say nothing of qualifying for jobs that are available, for which we should have the workforce. The same is true in my State of Vermont. All States have this very serious problem. With the statistics I just mentioned, the United States is still the most productive country in the world, but we are losing our edge to other industrialized nations such as Japan and Germany as well as other rapidly developing countries such as Taiwan, Korea, and China. Recent international exams have demonstrated that notwithstanding this warning we had 15 years ago, we have not made significant headway in being able to meet the challenge of that competition and to provide the workforce for those 190,000 jobs that are going begging right now. Over the past 25 years, the standard of living for those Americans without a 4-year postsecondary degree has plunged. In the next decade, we are in danger of being surpassed as the world's foremost economic power if we do not begin to redefine our priorities at the national, State, and local levels. This is an excellent bill, Mr. President. Senator DeWine, my good friend from Ohio, who was in charge of the subcommittee that developed this bill, along with Senator Wellstone, has produced a wonderful bill. It is going to do a great deal to bring us forward as we face the problems of the Nation and the problems of our national competitiveness. Mr. President, at this point I will be happy to yield the floor. Senator Wellstone, I believe, desires to be heard.","word.count":831,"sep11":-3.44101123595506,"years":1998.41853932584,"days":1217,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0546748853413578,"Topic 2":0.0176007188134363,"Topic 3":0.111938991697087,"Topic 4":0.0211189668600488,"Topic 5":0.00288675032615576,"Topic 6":0.00448170604581748,"Topic 7":0.623263087660048,"Topic 8":0.0108548927401161,"Topic 9":0.151504354461971,"Topic 10":0.00167564605396223},{"id":"10720010007356","body":"Non-Voting Delegate: Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio for yielding me the time.

Last year, the Republicans passed their economic plan. Due to their plan, we lost $4 trillion in surplus in about 15 months. We lost the opportunity for long-term economic growth. We lost the chance to promote opportunity in people's lives. And, most importantly, we lost the chance to pay down the debt and be ready to stabilize and take care of Social Security for the baby boomers. But, worst of all, the plan was dishonest. When you presented the plan, you could have gone ahead and not had a sunset in the plan and made the tax cut go out into the future, which is what you are trying to do today. I believe you did that because you wanted to mislead the American people and the Congress on what was actually happening. You had another chance when you presented your budget a few weeks ago to say that the tax cut should not have a sunset, that it should go out into the future. Once again, you did not do it. You did not do it because we are already back into the Social Security trust funds spending those dollars for current revenue needs. We are already back into the Social Security trust fund spending those dollars for current needs. We passed in this House five times a lockbox that said we would never spend the Social Security funds. Majority Whip DeLay vowed the people's hard-earned money would be saved so they can enjoy their well-deserved retirement. Majority Leader Armey vowed that the House is not going to go back to raiding Social Security and Medicare. In 2001, Chairman Nussle vowed that this Congress will protect 100 percent of the trust funds. Period. No speculation. No supposition. No projections. I think that everybody here probably voted at least once for the lockbox. Well, if you vote for this bill today, you are throwing the lockbox on the ground, breaking it open and taking all the money out of it finally. This is the definitive vote in this Congress on whether you want the economic plan to be permanent or whether you want to save Social Security, stabilize Social Security and ensure that it will always be there for every citizen. In truth, the bill that we ought to have in front of us today is not this bill. The bill we ought to have in front of us is how to make certain that Social Security will not be privatized, that it will not be raided, that it will always be there for everybody in the future. The Republicans have a plan of privatization. We think it leads to cuts in benefits and raising the retirement age. You do not want to bring it up this year because you do not want it to be an issue in the election. But mark my words, it is going to be an issue in the election, and the issue is, who is for Social Security and who is against it? Who is for saving Social Security and who is for reducing it? Who is for making it stable and who is for tearing it apart? The lockbox is broken open. This is the definitive vote of this Congress, not on taxes. That has been decided. The issue is, what is going to happen to Social Security? I urge Members to vote ``no'' against this bill. Vote for the motion to recommit.

I would be happy to. If we go to title I, we will see in the last year the Presidency and the Congress were controlled by the Democratic Party, there was $6.7 billion spent on title I. When the Republicans took over the Congress, by the way, that started to move up. In the years since President Bush has come into office, that number has jumped dramatically, so we are now up to $13.3 billion being spent on title I. The same is true of IDEA, which is a more startling number because the Clinton administration never proposed increases in IDEA until the last year and they were the result of a Republican Congress forcing those increases into the Clinton administration. Again, the IDEA numbers went down during the first years of the Clinton administration and started to go back up when the Republicans took control of the Congress. I was very involved when we demanded $1 billion a year. This President has proposed more increases in the first 3 years in IDEA funding--$1 billion each year onto each prior year--than the Clinton administration proposed in their entire 8 years in office. This is an example of that during the Clinton administration. IDEA funding was increased by $1.4 billion over their 8 years. In three years in office, President Bush has increased that money by $3.7 billion. It brings me back to a side issue. I found it entertaining that basically if we listen to the Senator from Massachusetts, he said all this new funding which has flowed into the various accounts--and it has been dramatic, as shown by the first chart, into special education and title I--it was a function of amendments offered by the Democratic leadership and the Democratic membership of this Congress. I point out I am not aware the Democratic Party controlled the Congress for these 3 years and it certainly did not control the Presidency, so I am not sure how they managed to do that. The fact is we could not pass the amendments unless the President agreed to them, signed the bills, and the Republican Congress agreed to them and passed it. What can be pointed out is when the Clinton administration and the Democratic Congress did control the issue of funding, had unilateral control of the issue over funding because they had both Houses of Congress and the Presidency, their accounts went down. It was not until a Republican Congress and a Republican Senate made it its No. 1 priority under Senator Lott, Senator Specter, and other Members of this Congress that we started to see the IDEA funding go back up dramatically. This is a very substantive point because it makes the case that what we are hearing from the other side is truly politics, the politics of education, not the substance of education. The substance of education is whether a low-income child in America today is better off in the system than they were 3 years ago. There can be no question but that child is. Finally, after years and years and years, we are finding out whether that child is being educated at the same level as his peers, through assessment, and when we find that out and if we discover that child is not being educated up to his peers, we put in place systems to address that. It is also important while we are on this topic to address the nature of this amendment. The amendment does not actually say the funding will go to education. The amendment sets up a reserve fund. The only thing the amendment actually does is raise taxes. It raises taxes by $17 billion and puts that money in an account. That account may or may not get spent. What we do know is it will raise taxes. What does $17 billion in new taxes account for? We heard from the other side it will go against those wealthy Americans who are making too much money and we need to tax them some more. That may philosophically be what they want to do, but as a practical matter that is not the effect this amendment would have. The proposals which are most at risk today in the tax laws do not impact wealthy Americans; they impact moderate- and middle-income Americans. It is the child tax credit that lapses, it is the marriage tax penalty which goes back into place, and it is the 10-percent bracket which gets kicked back out if we do not extend the tax reductions which are on the books. Ironically, the $17 billion of higher taxes which this amendment is going to force on the American people is probably going to be borne primarily by people who are married, because the spousal deductions and the marriage tax penalty, if not extended, add up to $15.7 billion, an ironic joining of numbers but clearly a logical place where it will occur. If the $17 billion tax increase occurs, it will occur as a result of these extenders not being put in place. Therefore, the spousal tax, which is $15.7 billion and which basically says if you are married you should not have to pay more than if you were separated, will end up being most likely the place I suspect this tax increase will occur. This amendment is unique in that it does not really impact the education accounts because it puts it into reserve. It does, however, raise taxes, and most likely on married people. While we are on the subject of how well funded No Child Left Behind is, we should go into some specifics. The No Child Left Behind part of title I--and what we have are charts that reflect how significantly we have increased funding under title I since President Bush came into office. Over the 8 years President Clinton was in office, he raised the dollars into title I by $2.6 billion. In the 3 years since President Bush has been in office, we have seen a $4.6 billion increase or almost twice as much, at least 70-percent higher funding levels from President Bush as from President Clinton. The argument is made that is still not enough, that we should be funding this to the full authorized level. I have been around this place for 11 years and I think I understand we do not fund at authorized level and everyone in this institution understands the authorized level is a statement, not a number. It is a goal. But it is not necessarily the goal that will be reached. What proves that beyond any serious doubt is the fact when the Democrats did control both the Presidency, the House and the Senate, they did not fund title I at full authorization. If there is credibility to their argument today, they would have had to have funded the authorization at its full level back when they controlled the Congress. But there is not credibility to their argument because they did not do that. In fact, when we look at the level of funding increases that occurred during their administration when they had the Presidency and when they held the Senate, it was pretty much flat funded, and it has only been with President Bush that the dramatic increases in these accounts happen. Do we have enough money in the pipeline to address title I and No Child Left Behind? That is an argument we hear a lot about. We do know the number has increased dramatically. States are getting a lot more money. In fact, a lot of states are not pulling down the full amount they have available to them. We know there is some good anecdotal information coming in right now that says No Child Left Behind is being adequately funded. I was interested to see a recent study by two public officials in Massachusetts, one of whom was the Massachusetts State school board chairman and another who was a member of the school board in Massachusetts. James Peyser is chairman of the Massachusetts Board of Education and Robert Costrell is a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, on leave, and currently serves as the chief economist for the Executive Office for Administration and Finance. These two gentlemen did a study of how much money was coming in under No Child Left Behind and whether it was adequate. The report says they thought there was sufficient money in the pipeline in Massachusetts to effectively implement the law. Here are a few things they cite: The $391 million of Federal Department of Education money that has been set aside specifically to administer the additional State assessments required under No Child Left Behind is more than adequate. That was their conclusion. They did say: Another finding: The estimated cost of testing required by No Child Left Behind runs at $20 per student, a small fraction of the per-pupil cost in the United States. Today, the per-pupil cost in the United States is $7,392. Interestingly enough, if you take the $391 million that the Federal Department of Education has set aside--and this is not their numbers-- to do the assessment work, you find it exceeds the $20 by a rather dramatic number. I know in New Hampshire, for example, it exceeds it by a factor of almost 10. In fact, the dollars increased per pupil from 2000 to 2004 in Federal spending, these two gentlemen discovered, was about $300 per pupil across the country, which certainly far outstrips the cost of the per-pupil testing requirement, which is the primary requirement in this law. So you have folks who are very intimately involved in this business in Massachusetts concluding that the funds which are flowing, which have represented a very significant increase in funding--as shown by this chart, $13.3 billion right now under this budget--more than exceeds what is needed to efficiently deal with the No Child Left Behind requirements. One of the reasons we hear a lot about No Child Left Behind not being funded I think is that most States and school districts today are under significant pressure. But the pressure is not coming from No Child Left Behind; the pressure is coming from local property tax burdens and State revenues. We have gone through a recession and those States have contracted in their revenues. Property taxes have gone down. As a result, school districts find themselves under pressure. I do not deny that. Everybody recognizes that.

This bill will provide funding for important initiatives that take effect in January 2006, just a few days from now. This morning the Senate passed, by the slimmest of margins, S. 1932, legislation to cut about $40 billion from mandatory spending programs over the next 5 years. I did not support S. 1932 because I believe it contains bad policy on Medicaid, on welfare, and on child support enforcement, among other things. For example, S. 1932 includes $5 billion in cuts to the child support enforcement program, which will mean that an estimated $19.6 million in child support funds will go uncollected in Montana over the next 10 years. That is money that should go to needy Montana kids. As for Medicaid, S. 1932 contains almost $2 billion in increased copays for Medicaid beneficiaries, as well as other Medicaid cuts. There are right ways to cut health care costs, through greater efficiencies that will save more money over time, and there is a wrong way to cut costs: on the backs of the Americans who can least afford to pay more for their health care. S. 1932 goes the wrong way and ignores the Senate's strong instruction to protect Medicaid beneficiaries from deep spending cuts. Last week 75 Senators supported a motion I offered in the Senate instructing budget conferees not to come back with a bill that included higher Medicaid copays and benefit cuts. Passage of S. 1932 is inconsistent with that vote. S. 1932 is bad news for the welfare program as well. Despite a Senate vote of 64 to 27 in support of removing TANF from S. 1932, the bill that the Senate passed today does just that: it reauthorizes TANF through the budget reconciliation process, with a punitive and unnecessarily austere set of provisions. The TANF Program, originally passed in 1996, has successfully reduced welfare caseloads and focused on moving parents from welfare to work. Changes to the TANF Program should build on the success of 1996 reforms, not reverse that success, as S. 1932 will ultimately do. Unfortunately, S. 1932 takes something that is not broken--and fixes it. For example, S. 1932 would raise work requirements without providing the funding needed to help States get people working. In fact, while S. 1932 includes $1 billion in additional funding for childcare, that is $7.4 billion short of what the Congressional Budget Office estimates to be the cost to States of meeting the TANF work requirements under this bill. The Health and Welfare Relief Act would extend TANF for an additional year, maintaining current policy on this important program. The Health and Welfare Relief Act would also extend transitional medical assistance, TMA, for an additional year, a program that is critical for helping families make the transition from welfare to work. The Health and Welfare Relief Act also contains a fix to the Medicare physician payment formula, which is set to cut Medicare physician payments by 4.4 percent on January 1. It prevents a cap on Medicare physical therapy from taking effect. And it extends an important provision for small rural hospitals' outpatient departments, helping them stay afloat. The bill also provides $60 million for CMS administrative funding, which should be spent to help educate seniors about the new Medicare drug benefit. And it contains $80 million for important legislation that I have sponsored related to high-risk pools, which are often the insurer of last resort. Finally, the Health and Welfare Relief Act includes important legislation providing relief to individuals and States harmed by Hurricane Katrina. Like the Lincoln amendment voted on in the Senate November 3, this bill contains provisions to: provide temporary Medicaid relief to Katrina survivors; help States struggling to meet health care costs incurred as a result of Katrina; and assist providers dealing with Katrina-related uncompensated care costs. I support the minority leader's efforts to pass these timely and critical provisions through the Health and Welfare Relief Act of 2005. While I do not support S. 1932, we should take the positive elements of that bill--as well as important provisions to aid Katrina victims--and pass them today.","word.count":694,"sep11":4.3876404494382,"years":2006.24719101124,"days":4004,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.102940807113523,"Topic 2":0.410061318790324,"Topic 3":0.0182270980566963,"Topic 4":0.0133870551698758,"Topic 5":0.220012744024341,"Topic 6":0.00989388549312879,"Topic 7":0.00775593447917635,"Topic 8":0.187898902600553,"Topic 9":0.0165262797788804,"Topic 10":0.0132959744935008},{"id":"10820030010142","body":"Billy Tauzin: I appreciate the gentleman's words Mr. Speaker, I would also remind those who are watching that her words that appeared in the Washington Star after the assassination of President Kennedy are still remembered and are still quoted today and are incredibly moving. She was also a rarity in that when she felt she was wrong, she said so. I remember that she was less than thrilled when President Bill Clinton gave Gerry Adams a visa to come to the United States to engage in talks about peace in Northern Ireland. It was a big deal to many of us who thought President Clinton was right because when you think of Irish, you think of Mary McGrory, and it was important to have her on your side. But later on Mary demonstrated the courage and the moral compass to publicly observe that her original words of skepticism might have been wrong. I admired that so much that she was willing to write in her column that she had a change of heart. Over the years, Mr. Speaker, I had the privilege of being invited to many of Mary's famous dinner parties. These remarkable events were attended by who's who in Washington. There were politicians, journalists, administration officials. Oftentimes the Ambassadors of Ireland, Italy, and India were present. There were young people and some not-so-young people, and there were lots of people whom Mary just found interesting, friends of hers over the years. The conversations were always lively and off the record. I learned a lot about Washington and the world just by sitting back and listening. These dinner parties, however, were about more than just politics and good conversation. They were parties that were also about entertainment and about fun. Mary liked to have people sing for their supper. Mark Gearan, a long-time aide to President Bill Clinton, former director of the Peace Corps and now president of Hobart and William Smith Colleges in Geneva, New York, was regularly enlisted to play the piano. Phil Gailey, a former coworker of Mary's at her beloved Washington Star and now with the St. Petersburg Times, would play some sort of harp instrument that to this day I still cannot identify. Some of Mary's guests, like Louise Slaughter and Tom Daschle and John Podesta and Dick Gephardt and Ed Markey and Max Cleland and Mary Gearan and Nancy Pelosi, the late Tip O'Neill and my former boss, the late Joe Moakley, were often called upon to sing from Mary's song book. Some of her favorites included ``Amazing Grace'' and ``The Battle Hymn of the Republic'' and ``When Irish Eyes Are Smiling.'' Other people were asked to tell jokes or recite poetry. And then there were people like me with absolutely no talent who would hide in the back of the room, I was always afraid she would call on me, and watch this amazing show unfold. Mary also did a great deal for this community. She was a huge supporter of St. Ann's Infant and Maternity Home in Hyattsville, Maryland. She volunteered there. She read to a lot of young kids, many of them who had no families. She gave them love, and she gave them hope. She used to take them to Hickory Hill, to Ethyl Kennedy's house, for swimming on a regular basis. A lot of the young kids could not pronounce her name, so they used to call her Mary Gloria instead of Mary McGrory. In fact they named a room after her called the Mary Gloria Room. Mr. Speaker, let me just conclude with one final personal thought. When Mary died, she left instructions about how her funeral would be conducted. Her assistant Tina called me and said that Mary wanted me to be a pallbearer. I was so touched, and I thought it was such a great honor. It was to me an honor like getting an honorary degree from an Ivy League college or university because I admired this woman so much. She stood for all the right things, and she was a great woman of integrity and character. Mr. Speaker, all of us who are gathered here today and I think all the people who are watching all throughout this country will miss Mary McGrory. I already do.","word.count":308,"sep11":1.61797752808989,"years":2003.47752808989,"days":3018,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.145220183255484,"Topic 2":0.302057689863113,"Topic 3":0.0101567498836747,"Topic 4":0.00915041980006791,"Topic 5":0.256205692708397,"Topic 6":0.00299278446264619,"Topic 7":0.00524747334806904,"Topic 8":0.0119338723701481,"Topic 9":0.00711555801968987,"Topic 10":0.24991957628871},{"id":"10920050079287","body":"John Cornyn: Mr. President, in the year 2004, the child support program collected $ 21.9 billion, while the program costs were $5.3 billion. Let me make this clear for my colleagues. In other words, for every $1 spent by the Federal taxpayer $4.38 in child support was collected for the children who need it. This is not the typical Federal program. This is not money that once spent we see no real benefit from. Rather, this is one that for every dollar that is invested $4.38 in child support is collected for the children who need it and who are legally entitled to it. The President's 2006 budget cites the child support program as ``one of the highest rated block formula grants of all reviewed programs Governmentwide.'' This high rating is due to its strong mission, effective management, and demonstration of measurable progress toward meeting annual and long-term performance measures. Even there, the numbers and these sort of accolades about this program do not tell the whole story. The story is completed by the fact that many children who receive child support are thereby prevented from drawing down other Government programs. For example, child support enforcement reduces reliance on Medicaid, temporary assistance to needy families, and other social service programs. It is estimated that more than 1 million Americans were lifted out of poverty through child support programs in the year 2002 alone. So in addition to money that is a good return on investment, $4.38 for every dollar, this money actually avoids additional expenditures of tax dollars by creating individuals who are qualified for other Government programs at a lot more expense to the Federal taxpayer. The problem with these cuts is that they are likely to reverse dramatic improvements in the child support program's performance over the past decade, and they may well force many families back on the welfare caseload. This means former welfare families and working families of modest income will lose an important source of income that now enables them to maintain financial self-sufficiency and thereby having to draw on Government resources through public assistance programs. The reason I feel so passionately about these particular cuts and the effectiveness of the child support enforcement program is that for 4 years before I came to the Senate I served as attorney general of Texas. It was my job, on behalf of approximately 1.2 million children, to see that they got the child support that they deserved, that they needed, and that they were legally entitled to. I am proud to say that my State ranks second in the Nation in terms of total collections, collections of about $1.8 billion in fiscal year 2005, and an increase of 83 percent of collections since fiscal year 2000. Now, that did not happen by accident. The reason it did happen is because of the great work being done by the men and women in the child support enforcement division of the State of Texas. It also happened because of the money that is provided by the Federal Government to help fund this necessary function. Due to the good work of these hard working men and women in the child support division, obligations, that is court orders, establishing support have risen from 55 to 82 percent of the qualifying population, and the cost-effectiveness in Texas has gone from $4.96 to $6.81. I mentioned the national average of $4.38 for every dollar spent. In Texas, we now collect $6.81 for every dollar spent. If the financial benefits, if the cost-effectiveness of this program, and if the avoidance of other costs to the Federal taxpayer were not enough, there are other intangible benefits to a strong and effective child support enforcement program. I have seen with my own eyes that too many families, when they divorce, reach a tacit agreement with regard to their children. Moms who frequently are the ones who have custody of the children sometimes reach a tacit agreement with their ex-spouse, typically the father, that if they do not exercise their visitation rights that the mother will not press the father for the financial support to which their children are legally entitled. What happens is that these children become two-time losers. Not only are they denied the financial benefits that the law says they are entitled to, they are denied contact with both parents that every child needs in order to have the best chance of success. Indeed, one of the intangible benefits of an effective child support program is not just the money collected, it is not just lifting children who would otherwise be in poverty out of poverty, it is not just avoiding the additional expenses of Government programs that would otherwise be invoked if that support was not there, it is literally the benefit of having a mother and a father both engaged, involved, and committed to the welfare of their children. I can think of no more important purpose that our efforts could serve than to reunite mothers, fathers, and children in a collective effort to improve the status of our children and their prospects for a bright future. So I hope in the conference on the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 our colleagues in the House will reconsider, and I hope our colleagues in the Senate will persuade them that of all the cuts they might have chosen these were the least deserving and that the money should be reinstated. I am confident throughout the $2.5 trillion Federal budget that there are other programs, other waste, other fat, other ineffective programs that could be more effectively cut and with far less damage to the most vulnerable among us. Finally, just for a couple of minutes, maybe 5, I want to speak about another subject, and that is the USA PATRIOT Act. It has been more than 4 years since our country was hit on September 11 by terrorists who care nothing for our way of life and nothing for the laws of war. They have attacked, because they could, innocent civilians in their jihad against those who have different ways of life and different views. We know the PATRIOT Act has been largely responsible for making America safer by bringing down the wall that prevented the sharing of information between law enforcement and intelligence agencies, by making available to our FBI and other intelligence-gathering bodies the same sort of techniques that are currently used against organized crime members and other criminals. Simply, what this body did in the PATRIOT Act was make sure that we used every legal and reasonable means to root out terrorism, to investigate it, and to stop it before it killed other innocent Americans. The PATRIOT Act was passed shortly after September 11 by a strong bipartisan vote of 98 to 1 in the Senate and 357 to 66 in the House. As I said, the PATRIOT Act enhanced law enforcement and intelligence agencies' ability to gather and analyze intelligence information and to use the most modern communications technologies, such as e-mail, cellular telephones, and the Internet, and it strengthened criminal laws and penalties against terrorists. As always, we must be concerned with the right balance between the need to protect innocent American lives and the need to preserve our civil liberties. Despite the dire predictions of some groups, the PATRIOT Act has not eroded any of our rights that we hold near and dear as Americans. To the contrary, the PATRIOT Act has enabled the Justice Department, the FBI, and the CIA and other Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies to cooperate and to share information and thereby save American lives and protect what is perhaps the most important civil liberty of all, and that is freedom from future terrorist attacks. I serve on the Judiciary Committee, and we have held 25 oversight hearings to date within the Judiciary Committee to ensure that we have both the tools we need and that we struck the right balance between civil liberties and our need to be secure. As all of our colleagues know, several sections of the PATRIOT Act are set to expire, sections 203 and 218, on December 31, 2005. These are the very provisions that have been instrumental in bringing down this wall that has previously separated different agencies of the Federal Government in getting information that is needed in order to save American lives and to stop terrorist attacks. I would just read briefly from recent testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee by Peter Fitzgerald, the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, who has recently been in the news. He has recounted from personal experience how this wall between law enforcement and intelligence personnel have operated in practice. He said: Well, people who remember the hearings before the 9/11 Commission will remember that there were a number of high-profile witnesses from Janet Reno, the former Attorney General of the United States, to former Attorney General John Ashcroft, who served during the first term of the Bush administration, and FBI Director Mueller. Witness after witness testified that that wall between criminal investigators and our intelligence-gathering communication prevented the sharing of information that has been absolutely critical in protecting innocent American lives and preventing future terrorist attacks. It is that same wall that will be resurrected on December 31, 2005, unless the U.S. Congress acts. It is absolutely critical that we look at this with cold-eyed clarity and not be swayed by scare tactics or emotional appeals. I am astonished, when I look at the reality of how the PATRIOT Act has made our Nation safer, that there are those who would use scare tactics to try to convince them that America's civil liberties are somehow imperiled. In fact, the American Civil Liberties Union, time and time again, through fundraising appeals and elsewhere, has misrepresented the PATRIOT Act in a way that I believe has frightened the American people. They happen to use it to raise money in their direct mail campaign, but it has had the disservi","word.count":2014,"sep11":4.29494382022472,"years":2006.15449438202,"days":3971,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.17574681116107,"Topic 2":0.0404070126423428,"Topic 3":0.010807482034188,"Topic 4":0.0171650575055158,"Topic 5":0.00413659419135922,"Topic 6":0.0712007247416516,"Topic 7":0.0173816021653284,"Topic 8":0.0284319393487446,"Topic 9":0.629668765436639,"Topic 10":0.00505401077315993},{"id":"10419950002497","body":"Gary A.

Such activities would certainly not qualify as education under any definition. Another example of an activity not contemplated by this bill would be a general media campaign of 30-second television commercials to the effect that propane is a good fuel choice. This would not be considered education, since the amount of substantive information likely to be contained in such a commercial would not qualify it as a legitimate educational tool. However, builder/architect outreach efforts that disseminate information about propane home heating devices, so that consumers likely to consider propane heating could make informed choices, would be permitted under this bill. Similarly, efforts to educate propane consumers about new advances in technology, such as the development of a propane heat pump or the development of new flaming technologies for weed control in agriculture, would be permitted. While these types of activities could be considered marketing or promotion, they education consumers by making them aware of more efficient and therefore less costly appliances and practices, and thus are beneficial to consumers. Similarly, efforts to disseminate safety-related educational materials which will benefit consumers, are also contemplated, even though it might be argued that such materials are promotional.

I want to thank the bipartisan group that has developed this legislation. We, of course, had hoped for more from it. We were hoping that we would get to $135 a week, as the Senate had proposed. And we, of course, hoped for other provisions in the bill. But, nonetheless, this is an important step forward, and an important response to the needs of the people in our area. I regret that there is objection to this legislation today, because I think it can only be objected to because folks just do not understand. I will not say that anyone is so callous as to not care, but I would have to say that you cannot really understand the dimensions of this issue if one objects to what we are doing here today. In many ways, the district that I represent and the area that I represent and the whole gulf region is frozen in time. Not a whole lot has changed since August 29 in this aftermath, except that in our city the water has been pumped out. But other than that, the city is largely depopulated. Business has still not stood up. Hospitals are not working. The school system is not working. Our city has no tax base. People do not have jobs. Many have no place to come back to, even for temporary housing. And those few who are there, of those who are there now, some 16,000 of them who are there in temporary housing, other housing conditions that are not ones that any of us would really like to have to put our families into, 16,000 of them do not have jobs now and are seeking this unemployment extension benefit. Across the Gulf there are 165,000 families who are either there or displaced some other place around our country who do not have jobs, not because they are not seeking them, not because they do not want to work, but because the storm has displaced them and destroyed not only where they live but where they worked as well. So the things we have talked about on the committee that reviewed the Katrina lawsuit, I do want to give some compliments to those who worked on that issue, who helped to, I think, make some critical decisions about it that I think will in the future portend better outcomes for these disasters as they occur. We hope they do not occur to anybody like they occurred to us; but if they do, I think we are in a far better position to deal with them now. I do want to say there is a great deal more to be done in our area. And we are hoping that this Congress as a result of the trip that will be taken in just a few hours down there to take some 35 or 40 Members of Congress down to take a look at this, that people can continue to develop an appreciation for the extent of this disaster. Many of us have said it was not just a natural disaster that drowned our city. There are also some man-made issues here about how our levees failed and about how we could have done more to make sure that that did not happen. Frankly, had the levees had not failed, our city would not have drowned and we would not have had the 80 percent of our city under water, and all of the untoward consequences I just talked to you about would not have happened. We would have had a serious storm, a series of brief clean-up, and people would be back in town, and we would not have to be here talking about extending unemployment. We are extending it today because this is a long-term set of issues here. This is not the ordinary disaster. We will be living with this for a very, very long time. It will take a lot of hard work on the part of all of us to make this close to right down the road. So I hope this Congress is prepared to stick with the people of the region. I hope we will get a full understanding of exactly how folks are suffering and how this approach is a Band-Aid approach to helping people who are in the most dire circumstances, as I said, not because of anything they have done or have failed to do, not because they are not looking for work every day, but because they are displaced. They are disconnected. Their jobs are destroyed. They have no place to go. And they have no means of support for their families except this Congress and this country come to their aid. And this is a small measure to do that. I am grateful to the committee for the work that it has done. I look forward to our committee realizing that there may be more work to do in this area. I hope we can make a rebound in this work as quickly as we can. But the biggest thing now is how we can keep families together, how we can give them a little support while they struggle to get back to normalcy, and how at the end of the day we can give them the choice to return to the place where they lived, where they have their cultural connections, and where they have dedicated a part of their lives and their influence and where they, frankly, want to return to. All of us have someplace we call home around here; and for them, no matter how dangerous we think it is, how difficult it is for them, these people, all of our people, all of us want to have a way to come back and reconnect to our home, at least to make a decision about whether we want to make a reconnection or not. Thank you for the opportunity to speak to this issue. I hope that whatever objections there are they will be withdrawn because this ought to be an issue on which we are all together, on which there is bipartisan agreement.","word.count":1039,"sep11":4.58707865168539,"years":2006.44662921348,"days":4075,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.152543994199927,"Topic 2":0.0346520544606925,"Topic 3":0.0239776518896402,"Topic 4":0.0178833440288674,"Topic 5":0.0928270435635996,"Topic 6":0.00906075290782921,"Topic 7":0.00374166358716491,"Topic 8":0.18047717243415,"Topic 9":0.00925103489394057,"Topic 10":0.475585288034189},{"id":"10820030045696","body":"Edward Kennedy: In a moment, I will yield to my colleague from South Carolina. Mr. President, before I yield to my colleague, I want to respond very briefly to my colleague and friend from California in regard, again, to the question of abortion. My colleague is concerned--I understand her sincerity because she has expressed it many times on the Senate floor. I don't doubt that sincerity at all--that somehow this bill sets a precedent regarding abortion. First of all, we all know statutes cannot overcome the Supreme Court decisions, constitutional law. We should not be concerned about what the statute will do. We particularly should not be concerned when we know many of the States have statutes very similar to what we propose to enact today. In fact, several of the States have had these statutes in place for up to 30 years. They have not in any way changed or infringed on abortion rights. Whatever one might think of abortion rights, these have not affected them and this bill will not affect them. To make sure of that, we put provisions in this statute, which I have read on the floor today, which make it crystal clear they will not in any way affect that. So we have precedent. We have the fact that statutes cannot interfere with constitutional law, plus we have precedent of many years of experience of State laws not interfering with abortion rights. So there is just no reason for anybody, when they come to the floor to vote on this, to think this is in any way going to affect abortion rights at all. My friend has talked about the fact that we follow what I believe 16 States have done when we begin to protect the unborn. Some States define it differently. My colleague has cited what California and some States do. They are defined differently. But we follow in this statute what some others States have done. In our proposed statute, we use this language, and I would say it is not what my colleague, with all respect, has said. This is what the language is: ``Who is carried in the womb,'' that is the language, the precise term that is used, ``carried in the womb.'' As a practical matter, since this is a criminal statute, we all know that to prosecute under this statute, a prosecutor would have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, to prosecute under this law, that there was this unborn child. They would have to prove the existence of the child. And then they would have to prove there was death or injury to the child beyond a reasonable doubt. They have to prove the existence, first of all, beyond a reasonable doubt, and then they have to prove the death or injury beyond a reasonable doubt. It is not, with all due respect, a question of at the moment of conception that this protection, as a practical matter, would kick in.

I have been informed--and I ask colleagues whether this is, in fact, the case--that there is actually another bill, not 342 pages long but 491 pages long, that will be laid down this afternoon by Senator Boxer. It is very difficult for any of us to be prepared when the target continues to move. To those who are concerned, as the Senator from California and the majority leader have been about the speed with which we address this bit of legislation, this does nothing but slow us down and make our job harder. I hope that is not the case, but that is what I am reliably informed. To me, it is counterintuitive to say the least that we would undertake to pass legislation with a pricetag of $6.7 trillion that will actually raise gas prices by 147 percent when families in my State and across the country are already paying an extra $1,400 a year for gas prices as a result of congressional inaction. Actually, I guess it is wrong to say congressional inaction because Congress has actually acted to impose a barrier to developing America's natural resources right here at home to the tune of roughly 3 million barrels of oil a day which, if it was made available and Congress would simply get out of the way, that would be additional supply which would bring down the price of oil which would give us some temporary relief as we transition to a clean energy future for our country and for the world. By that I mean by developing things such as greater use of nuclear power, using good old-fashioned American ingenuity, research and development to develop clean coal technology and the like. In the near term, I think we all have to acknowledge the obvious fact that oil is going to continue to be part of our future, but hopefully it will be a bridge to a future of clean energy independence, but not unless Congress acts. Congress is the problem. I suggest when we look around for the causes of our current energy crisis that Congress simply look in the mirror because we are the problem. It is unfortunate that when the Senate had an opportunity recently to vote on the American Energy Production Act that only 42 Senators voted for it. That was when gas was about $3.73 a gallon. Today the average price of a gallon of gas is $3.98 a gallon. I asked the question then, and I will ask it again today: Is the Senate going to reject an opportunity to develop America's natural resources and bring down the price of gasoline at the pump when gasoline is at $3.98 a gallon? How about when it is at $5 a gallon or $6 a gallon? Where is the tipping point at which Congress is finally going to wake up and realize it is the reason Americans are paying too much at the pump? Instead of dealing with that urgent need that affects every man, woman, and child in this country, this Congress has decided to head down another path, and that path is bigger Government, more taxes, higher energy costs for electricity and gasoline, and with the uncertainty that any of this will actually have an impact on climate, especially given the fact that countries such as China and India, of a billion people each, are not going to agree to impose this on themselves. So America is going to do this, presumably, while our major global competitors are not, and we are going to suffer not only those higher prices but job losses, reduction in our gross domestic product, and a competitive disadvantage with the rest of the world. Why would we do that to ourselves? At the same time, we see this Rube Goldberg bureaucracy that would be created. Yesterday, Senator Dorgan said this bureaucracy would make HillaryCare pale in comparison with its complexity as reflected on this chart. This is the kind of huge expansion in Government power over our lives and over the economy that is unprecedented in our country, and I suggest is the wrong solution, is the wrong answer to what confronts us today. In my State in Texas, it has been estimated under that Boxer climate tax legislation that as many as 334,000 jobs would be lost as a result of the increased costs and taxes associated with this bill, with a $52.2 billion loss to the Texas economy, and an $8,000 additional surcharge on each Texas household. That is over and above the $1,400 that each Texas family is already paying because of congressional inaction on oil and gas prices. Electricity costs, 145 percent higher; gasoline, 147 percent higher. I don't know why, at a time when the American people and the American economy are already struggling with a soft economy in many parts of the country, why we would do this to ourselves. It simply does not make any sense to me. I would like to have an explanation from our colleagues who are advocating this particular legislation how they can possibly justify this bill. What could be the possible rationale for legislation that would do this to my State and have this sort of Draconian impact on the economy of our country? I have heard some talk that said that gas prices have increased during the time President Bush has been in office. This is what has happened since our friends on the other side of the aisle have controlled both the House of Representatives and the Senate. We see there is a huge spike in gas prices during a Democratic-controlled Congress. But this should not be a partisan issue. This is a matter of the welfare of the American family and of the American economy. Why in the world would we not want to work together to try to develop the natural resources that God has given us to create that additional 3- million-barrel supply of oil so we can reduce our dependence on imported oil from foreign sources? The alternative proposed by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle is, OK, we are going to impose higher taxes on the oil industry which, of course, would be passed along to consumers and raise the price of gasoline even more or they say we are going to have another investigation into price gouging when the Federal Trade Commission has investigated time and time again and found no evidence to justify a charge of price gouging when it comes to gasoline prices or they say we are going to sue OPEC, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which has to be the most boneheaded suggestion I have heard because, of course, what in the world would you ask the judge to order if you were successful in suing OPEC? I presume to open the spigot even wider so we would be more dependent on foreign oil and not less. It is time for a real solution. This bill is not it. I call on my colleagues to do what we can to open America's natural resources to development and bring down the price of gasoline at the pump. I yield the floor.","word.count":732,"sep11":6.31460674157303,"years":2008.17415730337,"days":4690,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.82791577359039,"Topic 2":0.0539108893370803,"Topic 3":0.026998289730521,"Topic 4":0.0184105363510998,"Topic 5":0.0200749950745936,"Topic 6":0.0122116994701149,"Topic 7":0.00609164002073556,"Topic 8":0.0230051027094657,"Topic 9":0.00704474768094749,"Topic 10":0.00433632603505136},{"id":"10920050004584","body":"David Obey: The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New Mexico that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4882, as amended, on which the yeas and nays are ordered.

This terrible human tragedy must not be forgotten. Like the Holocaust, the Armenian Genocide stands as a tragic example of the human suffering that results from hatred and intolerance. One and a half million Armenian people were massacred by the Ottoman Turkish Empire between 1915 and 1923. More than 500,000 Armenians were exiled from a homeland that their ancestors had occupied for more than 3,000 years. A race of people was nearly eliminated. It would be an even greater tragedy to forget that the Armenian Genocide ever happened. To not recognize the horror of such events almost assures their repetition in the future. Adolf Hitler, in preparing his genocide plans for the Jews, predicted that no one would remember the atrocities he was about to unleash. After all, he asked, ``Who remembers the Armenians?'' Our statements today are intended to preserve the memory of the Armenian loss, and to remind the world that the Turkish government--to this day--refuses to acknowledge the Armenian Genocide. The truth of this tragedy can never and should never be denied. And we must also be mindful of the current suffering of the Armenian, where the Armenian people are still immersed in tragedy and violence. The unrest between Armenia and Azerbaijan continues in Nagorno- Karabakh. Thousands of innocent people have already perished in this dispute, and many more have been displaced and are homeless. In the face of this difficult situation we have an opportunity for reconciliation. Now is the time for Armenia and its neighbors to come together and work toward building relationships that will assure lasting peace. Meanwhile, in America, the Armenian-American community continues to thrive and to provide assistance and solidarity to its countrymen and women abroad. The Armenian-American community is bound together by strong generational and family ties, an enduring work ethic and a proud sense of ethnic heritage. Today we recall the tragedy of their past, not to place blame, but to answer a fundamental question, ``Who remembers the Armenians?'' Our commemoration of the Armenian Genocide speaks directly to that, and I answer, we do.","word.count":359,"sep11":-1.45224719101124,"years":2000.40730337079,"days":1925,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0610435563121116,"Topic 2":0.0712410175731222,"Topic 3":0.0188715148446686,"Topic 4":0.00634488237173547,"Topic 5":0.00949622870349708,"Topic 6":0.0110848211733917,"Topic 7":0.738091945276596,"Topic 8":0.00955646131476269,"Topic 9":0.0721691363365985,"Topic 10":0.00210043609351601},{"id":"10820040006172","body":"Carolyn Maloney: Mr. Speaker, I rise with my colleague and dear friend, the gentleman from Florida , with whom I founded and cochair the Hellenic Caucus to celebrate the 183rd anniversary of Greece's declaration of independence from the Ottoman Empire. March 25 has the same resonance in Greece that July 4 has in the United States. Democracy traces its earliest roots back to ancient Greece, but it developed new strength in modern times from American colonists who demanded independence from Great Britain. When the Greeks of 1821 fought for independence from Turkey, they truly drew inspiration from the ideals and institutions of the fledgling United States. After 400 years of Ottoman rule, the Greeks began an 8-year battle that ended with the defeat of the Turkish Army. Just as our defeat of the British Army was remarkable, so too was the Greeks' ability to defeat the Ottomans, a tremendous achievement. Against impossible odds, the Greeks broke free of one of the most powerful empires in history and gained their independence. Mirroring our patriotic displays on July 4, Greeks celebrate this day with parades, speeches and parties. As many of my colleagues know, New York City is the home of the largest Hellenic population outside of Greece and Cyprus. Western Queens, which I have the honor of representing, is often called Little Athens because of the large influence from Greece and Cyprus in that neighborhood. Recognizing the many similarities between our nations, it is a pleasure to take time to pay tribute to the Hellenic American community for their many contributions to America. We also honor the Federation of Hellenic Societies, which will lead the Greek Independence Day Parade in Manhattan. As the Olympics return to Greece this summer, they have wisely chosen the Olympic spirit as the theme of this year's parade. I am pleased to recognize this year's Grand Marshals, my friends Demetrios and Georgia Kaloidis and John and Margo Katsimatidis and Honorary Marshals Yiannis Skoularikis and George Papageorgopoulos. They will be accompanied by the Federation President, Apostolos Tomopoulos, and I will place in the Record the many names of the leaders of the Hellenic community who will be participating this weekend. In the year 2004, a vibrant Greek democracy once again serves as an inspiration to its neighbors and the free world. As discussions progress toward an end to the 30-year division of Cyprus, we hope that the serious concerns of the Hellenic Cypriot American community will be reflected in the final agreement. Forty-six members of the Hellenic Caucus joined in a letter to Secretary Colin Powell and Secretary General Kofi Annan to express their hope that any agreement will recognize, among other provisions, property rights, the demilitarization of Cyprus, the establishment of the legal obligations of the guarantor powers, and the presence of United Nations troops throughout the transition. I also led a delegation of members of the Hellenic Caucus who met with Secretary General Kofi Annan last Friday to discuss the negotiations regarding the reunification of Cyprus before it enters the European Union on May 1. We expressed our support for the Secretary General in bringing the parties to the bargaining table, but expressed concerns regarding some of the issues that remain open: property rights, governance, free movement between Greek and Turkish areas of the island, and the pace of demilitarization of the island. In particular, we raised questions about the ability of Cypriots to regain property that was seized or to receive fair compensation, how compensation would be funded, the unfairness of asking Greek Cypriots to foot the bill for buying back their own property, the ability of Greek Cypriots to have at least the same rights to acquire property in Turkish neighborhoods as foreigners do. We stressed the importance of having a central government that has the ability to make decisions, and we expressed concern about limitations on the ability of Cypriots to travel unimpeded to all areas of the island. While we applauded the plan to reduce the number of troops occupying the island, we expressed the hope that the U.N. troops would remain available to monitor the situation in Cyprus for as long as possible. We are hopeful that as the next round of negotiations take place, Secretary General Annan will do everything possible to ensure that our concerns will be addressed so that the final settlement will be acceptable to all Cypriots and Turks when it goes to the vote on the island. I congratulate the Federation for honoring the Olympics in a year in which the games will be returning to their birthplace, Greece. The world has truly benefited from the ancient Hellenic tradition of allowing athletic competition to triumph over political differences. I hope this Greek Independence Day will be a symbol of independence for all enslaved people, and we hope for the reunification of Cyprus and its entrance into the European Union. And, finally, Zeto e eleftheria.","word.count":817,"sep11":2.60112359550562,"years":2004.4606741573,"days":3368,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.879486635808476,"Topic 2":0.0481753383515439,"Topic 3":0.00764598424868491,"Topic 4":0.0173822788369204,"Topic 5":0.00904242480319382,"Topic 6":0.00786468154798246,"Topic 7":0.00623730469006022,"Topic 8":0.0125932534011556,"Topic 9":0.00815870029433464,"Topic 10":0.00341339801764845},{"id":"10419950026406","body":"Sherwood Boehlert: Now, that was a real introduction Mr. Speaker, I thought the name of this game was how to get economic growth. I now find that this foreign policy, this trade policy, that normally set by the President with bipartisan support, is now dependent on just how much we hate these bums that are running China, and If I had only known that, I would not even know why we are doing business with Japan. I mean I wan younger then, but it seemed to me that they were not very nice people then. And Germany; my God, the atrocities that were committed then. And Italy; they were not considered friends of ours. My God. And when it comes to personal experience, those North Koreans, they were chasing me all around North Korea, and the Chinese shot me. And still we got sanctions against Cuba, and really they have not bothered me too much. But the truth of the matter is, what are sanctions, and what is most- favored-nation treatment? It is not most favored nation. We are saying, if the United States does not get there first, then our so-called friends are going to get there. We also are saying if we get out of there, our great friends will be in there before we can pull out our equipment. And so this is not a question about who you like and who you do not like, because I am certain that this is not going to be an anti- Communist type of thing with my friends supporting trade with North Vietnam, with my friends supporting trade with North Korea. My God, the Communists, all around us. They are just not shooting us, they are buying things from us, and they are creating jobs from us, and what choices do we have? If we apply sanctions against them and it is a unilateral sanction, how do we hurt them? We do not have any friends in the United Nations that can depend on our credibility. We now have already told the United Nations, ``Elect who you want for a secretary general, we're vetoing ahead of time.'' We now told people that are doing trade with this little island in the Caribbean, ``You dare do trade with them,'' or, ``You do trade, have your companies any place where any Cuban says he has a piece of land, and we're going to take away your visas and have sanctions against you.'' Who believes us any more? Why cannot the United States have credibility? Why cannot we believe in something and say what the name of the game is? Do we want to find atrocities? Answer: ``You bet your life.'' And we are doing business in Africa with countries. We say we are going to have sanctions against Nigeria. Who is joining us with the sanctions? If we are going to hurt somebody, make certain that we win and stop teasing around throwing out sanctions or we are not going to trade with them when other people are going to trade. I say, ``Don't hurt yourself just because you're dealing with a bunch of bums. You're dealing with 1.2 billion dollars' worth of good people led by a bunch of bums. Well, what's your option? You just going to say, `I quit; I am not going to play the game; you didn't pass the personality test'?'' It is dollars and cents. It is hard bucks. They already said we have to balance the budget, and of course my President now finds it very convenient to adopt most of these ideas. He says balance the budget. He already said we have to cut revenues, and my President says, makes some sense, too: We have got to have tax cuts. He already said that we have to shrink Government. Well, my God, Government is being shrunk. But a strange thing is happening in this country, and that is that the old people are living older, and since they believe the answer to every social ill that we have are penitentiaries, they are building more jails. Oh, we are not going to spend on education; leave that to the local kids. Well, the local kids are failing, they are in the street, they are jobless, they are ignorant, they have no training, they end up with drugs, making kids, getting violent, going to jail. Oh, how are we going to deal with that? Well, the only name that we have in town is expanding the economy, and the only way we can expand the economy is not consuming everything that we make but by selling it to somebody even if we do not like the people we are selling it to.","word.count":241,"sep11":-6.49157303370786,"years":1995.36797752809,"days":131,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0326761313012736,"Topic 2":0.321385933467549,"Topic 3":0.00598079979335287,"Topic 4":0.035547599709902,"Topic 5":0.0070976376108111,"Topic 6":0.0040436016998582,"Topic 7":0.0109162306972115,"Topic 8":0.0159655150513673,"Topic 9":0.560732369788533,"Topic 10":0.00565418088014157},{"id":"10720020026437","body":"Deborah Pryce: Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me this time and for his strong leadership on this resolution. I rise in strong support of the rule which will allow this body and the American people the opportunity to engage in over 20 hours of debate on the resolution to authorize the use of force against Iraq. I would like also to take a moment to thank the distinguished Chairman of the Committee on International Relations, the gentleman from Illinois , and the ranking member, the gentleman from California , for their efforts to put this country ahead of any other consideration. Mr. Speaker, it is with a very heavy heart that we begin this debate on a resolution to authorize the use of force against another nation to protect freedom, the freedom of all Americans, the freedom of Iraq, the freedom of people all around the world. This is the freedom to be safe from fear, to be safe from oppression, and to be safe from hate. It is a choice that none of us wishes to make, but it is a choice that has been made for us. The President made his case to the American people last night and to anybody able to hear his speech. Unfortunately, the major networks chose not to carry it, so anyone whose local affiliates carried it or who have cable were able to hear his impassioned plea. But anyone who could hear his speech knows that this President does not want to lead us into war, but little has changed since he identified the threat from Iraq in his January State of the Union address. Iraq continues to pose a serious and imminent threat from its development of weapons of mass destruction and the obvious potential for Iraq to transfer these weapons to terrorist groups, terrorist groups that, like Saddam Hussein, hate the United States of America. There is no question that Saddam Hussein is a dangerous man and, under his leadership, Iraq is a dangerous nation. Our quarrel is not with the Iraqi people. They are among those who have suffered the most under this regime; and, like the Afghanistan people when liberated from al Qaeda, the Iraqi people will rejoice if liberated from Saddam Hussein and his regime of terror. By acting today, we move to protect the American people. We do not abandon diplomacy, and we seek international support. However, we do serve notice to the Iraqi regime and, indeed, the world that the United States will defend itself against all threats. As we move forward, we keep in mind that the goal of any decision with regard to Iraq must be disarmament. Saddam's arsenal of terror must be dismantled, and time may not be on our side. Each day we wait, each day we put off acting, each day we are led astray by idle delays puts us closer to real risk. Iraq's claim that they are now suddenly willing to allow inspectors back in is extremely dubious. We have been down this road before. To achieve real assurance that Iraq is disarmed and cannot threaten our national security, more serious action may need to be taken. For the last year, we have waged a war against extremism, against hate, and against terror. Today's resolution will give our President the tools he needs to continue and to win this fight. I urge my colleagues to support this rule to allow us to enter into this full and open debate.","word.count":582,"sep11":1.10112359550562,"years":2002.9606741573,"days":2834,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0317941613863416,"Topic 2":0.172926927242514,"Topic 3":0.00806110828850774,"Topic 4":0.574008467929347,"Topic 5":0.0125658870363283,"Topic 6":0.00213991265222747,"Topic 7":0.00428156950317919,"Topic 8":0.00847742594752321,"Topic 9":0.183928175789292,"Topic 10":0.00181636422473977},{"id":"10720010007931","body":"Ron Lewis: Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to convey certain public land within the Sand Mountain Wilderness Study Area in the State of Idaho to resolve an occupancy encroachment dating back to 1971.","word.count":456,"sep11":-0.331460674157303,"years":2001.52808988764,"days":2324,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.508943019017453,"Topic 2":0.0687881876700698,"Topic 3":0.0136577742479149,"Topic 4":0.0327725530761935,"Topic 5":0.0102134628035459,"Topic 6":0.0180228407565467,"Topic 7":0.0253100815522985,"Topic 8":0.0683666212579202,"Topic 9":0.243418834088352,"Topic 10":0.0105066255297057},{"id":"10720020000962","body":"William Clay: Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentleman from Michigan for his leadership on this issue. We certainly appreciate his leadership and sponsorship of the bill. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1343, the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act. Consideration of this bill is long overdue, and its passage is absolutely critical. I urge the House Republican leadership to allow the bill to come to the floor for a vote. H.R. 1343 gives law enforcement officers at all levels of government the tools they need to deal with these terrible acts of hate-based violence. This legislation also sends a message to the world that crimes committed against people because of who they are or what they believe are particularly evil and particularly offensive and will not be tolerated in this country. These types of crimes are committed not just against individuals, not just against a single person, but against society and against all Americans. These crimes are not only meant to hurt the unfortunate individual who falls victim to such acts, but they are also meant to intimidate, harass, and menace others who were not directly attacked. A few years ago a man filled with hate shot up a Jewish community center in Los Angeles, wounding children and teachers in a place that was supposed to be a protective sanctuary for children. Following his capture the man said he had shot at those children because he wanted to send a message. He said he wanted to send a wake-up call to America to kill Jews. By passing this bill we will be rejecting such messages and committing the full measure of our justice system to ending such hateful violence.","word.count":283,"sep11":0.418539325842697,"years":2002.27808988764,"days":2591,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.181830998069368,"Topic 2":0.412711971184383,"Topic 3":0.00939742717899226,"Topic 4":0.271436624824329,"Topic 5":0.0201394405992265,"Topic 6":0.00470595617657738,"Topic 7":0.0128247964986112,"Topic 8":0.00901396610944776,"Topic 9":0.0696940329278483,"Topic 10":0.00824478643121689},{"id":"10519980060888","body":"Speaker: Without objection, it is so ordered Mr. D'AMATO.

I would like to thank Chairman Skelton and Ranking Member Hunter for allowing this resolution to come to the floor. I also want to thank Mr. Courtney and, of course, Mr. Rogers. Among the many things that make our Nation so great is our strong and valiant military. The strength, courage, and dedication of the men and women in uniform keep us safe at home from threats abroad. While Congress rightfully has and continues to recognize these men and women, so too should we honor their family members who serve as constant pillars of strength for them. Behind each and every one of the more than 2 million individuals serving in the United States Armed Forces is a multitude of family members, be it mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, spouses, aunts, uncles, extended family, offering encouragement and providing the emotional and physical support our defenders need to successfully protect our Nation. These family members make daily sacrifices as they forgo time with their loved ones and face increased worry and uncertainty as members of the Armed Forces serve extended tours abroad and engage in more frequent training missions. Even under the most difficult circumstances, when one of our soldiers is wounded in action, these families willingly take on the role of caregiver. They selflessly postpone their personal goals and rearrange their lives to meet the physical and emotional needs of their loved ones as they transition back to civilian life. Our members of the Armed Forces are able to exhibit the level of strength and devotion that is their trademark, in part because of the network of support that they know they have at home. That is why I have introduced H. Con. Res. 295, which recognizes the integral role the families of our servicemembers play in defense of our Nation. Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor and privilege that I rise today to express my deepest appreciation to the immediate and extended families of the members of the Armed Forces for their unwavering support that they provide to our Nation's heroes. I urge all my colleagues to do the same by supporting this resolution.","word.count":370,"sep11":7.01685393258427,"years":2008.87640449438,"days":4940,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.135564460372645,"Topic 2":0.232724353722226,"Topic 3":0.0700328944250509,"Topic 4":0.0259191875128604,"Topic 5":0.00816059726052475,"Topic 6":0.276510110731158,"Topic 7":0.223338151480808,"Topic 8":0.0111614440072612,"Topic 9":0.0130915516660443,"Topic 10":0.00349724882142247},{"id":"10419950048990","body":"Frank R.

Mr. President, homelessness is a problem that the American people want solved. The number of homeless Americans has grown steadily over the last three decades and it will continue to grow until we responsibly address the issue of homelessness. Studies put the number of homeless at more than 600,000 people on any given night. It is even more shocking to find that children are now the fastest growing portion of this homeless population. As a caring Nation, we must no longer ignore this growing and often overlooked part of our population. I firmly believe that every citizen deserves not only a place to sleep at night, but a real opportunity to improve their lives. Our national efforts must focus on helping these families. Senator Sarbanes' amendment restores $360 million for homeless assistance funding to the fiscal year 1996 VA-HUD appropriations bill, bringing the funding level back up to fiscal year 1995 levels. These funds will enable local governments, communities, and nonprofits to form comprehensive, flexible and coordinated strategies for ending homelessness. These funds will help local agencies leverage additional money needed to aid homeless people with disabilities, create more housing and provide the services and facilities needed to move people into situations where they can live independently. Restoring homeless assistance funding to 1995 levels is also an important part of the authorizing committee's effort to reform HUD in general and specifically to reform our delivery of homeless assistance. Last year's Senate Banking Committee bill created a single formula grant program which would replace the seven different categorical grant programs at HUD. This formula grant will allow better coordination of homeless services at the local level and facilitate better planning as funding levels become more predictable. The VA-HUD bill allows for this formula but does not provide adequate funding. The funds restored in this amendment will raise homeless assistance funding to a level that will allow a formula approach to make sense. Unfortunately, no matter how we restructure HUD, during the transition some people are going to fall through the cracks. The homeless programs are the safety net that catches them. Mr. President, earlier this year I had a chance to meet with Lucie McKinney and she reminded me of her late husband's tireless efforts and determination to end the cycle of homelessness. We must do all we can to continue Stewart McKinney's work.","word.count":428,"sep11":-6.11516853932584,"years":1995.74438202247,"days":265,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0161026404283348,"Topic 2":0.111843111651373,"Topic 3":0.423520408614057,"Topic 4":0.00510824172093581,"Topic 5":0.0447335818249876,"Topic 6":0.0281653719665592,"Topic 7":0.348379167690421,"Topic 8":0.00629344222755167,"Topic 9":0.00411374155995784,"Topic 10":0.0117402923158224},{"id":"10519980060279","body":"Robert Byrd: Mr. President, I commend the courage and decisiveness displayed by President Clinton and the Secretary of State, Ms. Albright, in attempting to get the Arab-Israeli negotiations back on track. The attacks by some in the other body are disappointing and not helpful. If there has been coercion and strong-arming or unreasonable tactics on the matter of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians over the last year or so, Mr. President, in my judgment, it has not been on the part of the United States. The unfortunate reality as I view it, is that the Israeli Prime Minister has pursued a policy of paralysis in the peace process. I think it is unwise for any responsible American leader to suggest that this practice should continue, and the United States should not intervene to get the negotiations underway again in a meaningful way. The Israeli Prime Minister has traveled to Washington before, totally empty- handed, with no proposal for moving the negotiations forward. In so doing, he has catered to the forces working against progress. He has embarrassed the United States, and all who have supported a peaceful constructive resolution of the issues on the table regarding Israeli and the Palestinians. It is no wonder, given his track record on the negotiations since he became Prime Minister, that the administration has seen fit to require some assurance that another visit to Washington will produce something more than empty rhetoric and more stonewalling. I cannot support more strongly the position of Secretary Albright, that if the Israeli Prime Minister is unwilling to accept some moderate specific American proposals for progress on the West Bank that there is not much point in another fruitless trip to Washington, which might further inflame the situation in the Middle East. As to the Israeli Palestinian problem, Mr. President, it has always taken three to tango. All parties, the United States, the Palestinians and the Israelis must want the negotiations to move forward, and it is only through compromise that success can be achieved. The United States has used its good offices to broker the negotiations and has burnished substantial financial resources to ensure the stability of Israeli on an unstinting basis. Any one of the parties can derail the negotiations and so it is a measure of the tremendous difficulty the United States has had with the Netanyahu government that the administration has felt it necessary to take specific steps to get the negotiations back on track. Therefore, Mr. President, I commend the President for this initiative in the interests of getting the negotiations jump-started. I hope that cooler heads will prevail and that all Americans will see the wisdom of supporting a reasoned but decisive approach to the negotiating effort.

Major nursing home reform passed Congress in 1987 as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act [OBRA], Public Law 100-203. This act required significant changes in staffing and training requirements, quality of care, patient services, and enforcement of new nursing home standards. Because Congress was concerned about the ability of the nursing home industry to absorb costs of this magnitude, special language was included to ensure that the Medicaid reimbursement systems of the States were altered to cover these costs. Just as care was taken to ensure that the Medicaid reimbursement system adequately accommodated the OBRA 1987 cost increases, I believe it is fair to do so in conjunction with a new minimum wage law. The increase in the minimum wage should be taken into account in plans submitted by States to HCFA. The Federal nursing home quality standards have been enormously successful in improving the quality of care and quality of life of our nursing home residents and we do not want to do anything to diminish the successes we are achieving as a result of those reforms. We are all well aware that States now are setting Medicaid rates, not on the basis of costs incurred by facilities in providing long-term care services, but rather on State budgetary constraints. A recent survey of nursing homes nationwide indicates that in half the States, a majority of facilities do not receive Medicaid rates that cover the actual cost of providing care to their Medicaid patients. This situation will only worsen if States are not held accountable for recognizing increased labor costs that facilities will incur under this new minimum wage law.","word.count":274,"sep11":-5.30898876404494,"years":1996.55056179775,"days":552,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.126693855625284,"Topic 2":0.36714519376424,"Topic 3":0.0153914397998342,"Topic 4":0.0134236530994208,"Topic 5":0.148782346355374,"Topic 6":0.0103006600785028,"Topic 7":0.0077556913266768,"Topic 8":0.268733951110807,"Topic 9":0.0208667856430179,"Topic 10":0.020906423196843},{"id":"11020080045460","body":"Carl Levin: Mr. President, this budget resolution lays out a fiscally responsible plan with the right priorities, which include job creation, tax breaks for the middle class, and programs that ensure the safety, health, and education of our Nation's children. Our Nation is enduring hard economic times. Congress cannot neglect its responsibility to enact priorities which help our Nation return to a state of economic stability and prosperity. Through this budget, the Senate will set the blueprint for its work to help reverse the current administration's failed fiscal and economic policies. Since 2001, we have lost over 3 million manufacturing jobs nationwide. My home State of Michigan has lost over 250,000 manufacturing-related jobs. The manufacturing industry faces pressure from international corporations that are subsidized by their respective governments; our own government needs to act to keep American manufacturing companies competitive in the global marketplace and competing on a level playing field. That is why I am glad that the Budget Committee included in this resolution my proposal to establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund to promote American manufacturing. Congress needs to act to revitalize our domestic manufacturing sector. The American Manufacturing Initiative, which I announced last year with a number of my colleagues, would help address critical needs in the manufacturing sector by increasing Federal support for research and development; expanding the scope and effectiveness of manufacturing programs across the Federal government; increasing support for the development of alternative fuels and leap-ahead automotive and energy technologies; and creating tax incentives to encourage continued U.S.- based production of advanced technologies and supporting infrastructure. Over the last year, we have been able to give more support to some components of the AMI--primarily increasing authorized funding levels for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership and the Technology Innovation Program and providing significant new funding for defense manufacturing programs--but much more needs to be done. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues and the next president to support the manufacturing sector in a meaningful way, and make a wise investment in the long-term growth, health, and stability of the manufacturing industry. I am also pleased that this budget paves the way for a second, much- needed, economic stimulus package. The economic stimulus package that passed in January of this year was a very modest first step toward addressing our economy's problems. Further initiatives such as an extension of unemployment insurance and housing relief are urgently needed and this budget provides $35 billion toward that effort. The continuation of the pay-go rule, which would require any new spending or tax cuts to be paid for elsewhere in the budget unless a supermajority of at least 60 votes in the Senate agrees otherwise, shows that the Senate is committed to reversing the administration's digging into a deeper and deeper ditch of debt. I hope the Senate will live up to this important standard we set for ourselves. This budget resolution will also allow for much-needed tax relief for middle-class families by shielding them from the alternative minimum tax. Congress has long known that this is the only fair thing to do for America's middle-class families, since the tax was never intended to impact them in the first place. I am also pleased that we passed the Baucus amendment to pave the way for extending a number of existing tax cuts that help working families, including a tax credit provided for each child in a family and relief from the joint-filing penalty paid by America's married couples. It also extends estate tax reform at the 2009 level, meaning that married couples would be able to pass on to their beneficiaries estates worth up to $7 million before they become subject to the estate tax. The Baucus amendment also includes fully paid-for tax relief to members of America's military, including a provision allowing combat pay to count toward a refundable federal income tax credit. I am pleased that the Senate adopted the Collins-Levin amendment that sets forth important steps to be taken in the area of energy tax policy. Specifically, our amendment proposes extension of the current production tax credit for biodiesel fuel and the small-producer biodiesel tax credit, both of which will expire at the end of 2008. Many of our small biodiesel producers are already having a hard time now because of the increasing prices of feedstock. Without this tax credit, they may not be able to stay afloat and we could lose these new sources of biodiesel fuels. We cannot afford to do that. We also propose a new production tax credit for cellulosic ethanol, up to a limit of 60 million gallons. Ethanol produced from cellulosic sources offers the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent or more. Again, this is a necessary boost needed by those pushing the technology toward cellulosic ethanol to ensure that they are able to bring the technology to commercialization. Finally, we propose a new tax credit for plug-in hybrid vehicles, including a tax credit for hybrid conversion kits that can modify current technologies with the latest in battery technology as it is developed. The combination of advanced battery technology and advanced hybrid systems offer tremendous potential for reduction of oil consumption, but tax incentives will be necessary to offset the increased cost to consumers and to achieve widespread acceptance by consumers. These tax credits will accelerate significantly the availability of these new plug-in hybrid vehicles to consumers. I am also pleased that this budget plan provides for Congress to go after the offshore tax haven and tax shelter abuses that are undermining the integrity of our tax system, and I commend Chairman Conrad and the Budget Committee members for their willingness to address these complicated areas. Cracking down on these abuses is a critical step toward achieving fairness in our tax system. For many years, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, of which I am chairman, has been looking at the problem of offshore corporate, bank, and tax secrecy laws and practices that help taxpayers dodge their U.S. tax obligations by preventing U.S. tax authorities from gaining access to key financial and beneficial ownership information. The subcommittee has also investigated abusive tax shelters, which are complicated transactions that are entered into to provide tax benefits unintended by the Tax Code. They are very different from legitimate, congressionally-approved tax shelters, such as deducting the interest paid on your home mortgage or taking tax credits for historic building preservation. Abusive tax shelters, on the other hand, are marked by one characteristic: no real economic or business rationale other than tax avoidance. We cannot tolerate high- priced accountants, lawyers and banks concocting ways for tax cheats to offload the missing revenue from their unpaid taxes onto the backs of honest taxpayers. That is why I have introduced The Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act, on which I am proud to have as cosponsors Senators Coleman, Obama, Salazar and Whitehouse. This bill provides a powerful set of new tools to clamp down on offshore tax and tax shelter abuses. If Congress addresses these inequities, it would bring in billions of dollars needed to pay for many important national priorities. These priorities are recognized in this budget, including education, children's health care, veterans' medical care, community development block grants, and law enforcement. We can go a long way toward paying for these critical programs by stopping these tax dodges that rob the Treasury of up to $100 billion a year, and shift the tax burden from high income persons and companies who are principal users of offshore tax havens onto the backs of working families who pay their taxes. This budget can provide for ample revenues by shutting them down, which is not only reasonable, but crucial to improving the integrity of our tax system. I applaud Chairman Conrad and the Budget Committee, as well as the Finance Committee and Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley, for their efforts on this front, and I look forward to working with them and other allies on this issue as we address these problems over the next year. The blueprint set forth in this resolution is worthy of support. It sets us on a course of fiscal responsibility and paves the way for important investments in America's future.","word.count":1370,"sep11":6.67134831460674,"years":2008.5308988764,"days":4817,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.854901915543068,"Topic 2":0.0505810498077899,"Topic 3":0.00994401702330276,"Topic 4":0.0233678689343687,"Topic 5":0.0104626879195712,"Topic 6":0.0101512303739248,"Topic 7":0.00820325027376509,"Topic 8":0.0172309492340984,"Topic 9":0.0107074974169159,"Topic 10":0.00444953347319537},{"id":"10720010007392","body":"Earl Blumenauer: Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time Mr. Speaker, earlier I pointed out my broad concern with the high loan rates that we have in this bill and the fact that it will depress commodity prices requiring more of net farm income to come from the government. Last year's figure was 40 percent of net farm income came from the government. I believe with lower prices as a result of this bill, that number will exceed 50 percent quickly. There are other problems with the bill. I think the message this sends to our trading partners around the world is the wrong message. These payments will violate our trade agreements with the World Trade Organization, and send a strong signal to our allies who worked with us to reduce trade barriers around the world that we are not serious about this. It tells our competitors we are going to continue to do what we have been asking them not to do. Secondly, when it comes to the issue of labeling, I think it violates our agreement with our neighbors, Mexico and Canada, and I think it is discriminatory against our other trading partners around the world. So from a trade standpoint, I think we are sending some mixed and bad messages. The dairy program that we have contained in this bill is totally unnecessary. Over the last 4 years, in all of agriculture, dairy prices were at record highs. Dairy farmers had the best 4 years they ever had. Why do we need to spend $2 billion for dairy? Pure and simple, for political reasons coming from the other body. It is unnecessary, it will drive down prices, and will drive up exposure to the taxpayers. But as I close, as Members of Congress, we are here, and we are here to make decisions on behalf of our constituents. As I said earlier, this is not an easy decision on my part or others who are opposing this bill. We have great respect for the gentleman from Texas and the gentleman from Texas who have guided this process; but we have to make a decision as Members of Congress, and the decision I have made, reluctantly, is to oppose this bill because in the end, it will lead to much bigger problems. We have heard that if we do not pass this bill, we will have really big problems. We can do an emergency supplemental to fix those problems in the short run, and we can produce this bill in a much more sane political environment that will give us a much better product after the election early next year. Mr. Speaker, the point I want to make to my colleagues is that we can do better. I know that it is a difficult process to come up with a uniform policy for the whole country, but the fact is that we can do better. We must do better to balance the interest amongst those in agriculture, and to balance the interest of those in agriculture with the interest of the taxpayers and others who are always here seeking our government help.","word.count":263,"sep11":-0.334269662921348,"years":2001.52528089888,"days":2323,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.108040235156623,"Topic 2":0.406625045715085,"Topic 3":0.0102597405128326,"Topic 4":0.0163061379601957,"Topic 5":0.00619705456762456,"Topic 6":0.0419073670748879,"Topic 7":0.00325220574507342,"Topic 8":0.010882275332287,"Topic 9":0.390321849849726,"Topic 10":0.0062080880856647},{"id":"10519970080571","body":"Barbara Mikulski: The question is on agreeing to the motion to table amendment No. 3541.

Time and again, the Saudis have shown that they are not our allies in the war on terror. In fact, they are soft on al Qaeda terrorists operating in Saudi Arabia. Their efforts to prosecute terrorists have been fruitless and devious, and their financing of terror groups has been all but well documented. Saudi blood money does not only threaten the United States, but it also threatens our good friend and ally, the State of Israel. More than 50 percent, 50 percent of Hamas funding comes from Saudi Arabia, as Ambassador Dore Gold testified in the House Committee on International Relations. The Saudis impede American efforts in fighting our war on terror. They have denied U.S. officials access to several suspects in custody, including one Saudi who had knowledge of extensive plans to inject poison gas into the New York City subway system. The Saudi connection to al Qaeda is undeniable. In fact, al Qaeda has an implicit deal, an implicit deal with the Saudi royal family to desist from violence in the kingdom in exchange for Saudi financing. These inexcusable actions by the Saudi Government make them unworthy of any foreign assistance or aid from our country.

It authorizes Congress, at long last, to pay our overdue debt to the United Nations. It clears the way for comprehensive UN reform. The bill also includes a much-needed, major restructuring of our nation's foreign affairs agencies. In the years since the Cold War ended, the maps of the world have been redrawn. The reorganization plan in this bill would enable us to redraw our foreign affairs structure to match the new, post-Cold War reality. It is the product of careful and detailed negotiations, and enjoys broad, bipartisan support. Despite these important provisions, I regret that I will vote against this conference report, and I urge my colleagues to do likewise. The reason I oppose this report is because, in addition to its positive provisions, it also contains an extreme and extraneous provision the Senate has considered and rejected many times in the past. This provision--the so-called ``Mexico City language''--would do serious damage to international family planning efforts--including efforts that have nothing to do with promoting abortion and that, in fact, help to prevent abortions. It would do serious damage to one of the ideals on which our own nation was founded, freedom of speech and expression. The Mexico City language would bar any agency that receives international family- planning assistance from the U.S. from using their own funds to pay for abortions, or to lobby for abortions. Let me repeat: This bill does not tell agencies it cannot use U.S. funds for these services. That is already prohibited under existing law. This bill tells agencies in other nations that they may not use their own funds to pay for, or lobby for, abortions, without losing all U.S. family-planning assistance. This goes far beyond what the current law prescribes. This body has rejected this kind of restriction in the past because we agreed it is inappropriate to place such limitations on how organizations in other nations may use their own money. Mr. President, it is still inappropriate for us to do so. But it is important to note that the Mexico City language is not simply the language this body has previously rejected. In 2 important ways, it is even more extreme. First, this Mexico City provision will cut funds for international family-planning services. The conference report mandates that family planning agencies in other nations may not receive one dollar in U.S. family-planning assistance unless and until they certify that they will not perform abortions with their own funds. It is true that the President may waive this restriction. But if he does so, U.S. aid for international family-planning programs for that year would be limited to $356 million--$44 million less than we are now spending. Second, this new version of the Mexico City language includes a provision that not only prohibits funding for any organization that lobbies to change abortions laws in other nations, as the former version did. It goes far beyond that prohibition to forbid recipients of U.S. funds from making any public statements about abortion. They are forbidden, Mr. President, even from expressing concerns about the dangers of illegal abortions. And the President has no authority to waive this provision. The Secretary of State has rightly labeled this restriction a ``gag rule.'' In no way would this provision improve the lives of women and children around the world, nor would it reduce the incidence of abortion. Instead, this gag rule would violate one of our country's most hallowed principles, the principle of freedom of speech. What kind of message would we be sending to the rest of the world if violate our founding principles? That those principles are not inalienable after all? That they may have worked 200 years ago, but they are not applicable in a modern world? Surely, at a time when struggling new democracies all over the world are looking for guidance and inspiration, these are not messages we want to send. But the greatest danger of these extreme and extraneous provisions is that they will not improve the lives of women and children anywhere, nor will they prevent abortions anywhere. In fact, they will have the opposite effect. They will make it more difficult for women to plan their own families. U.S. support of international family planning programs have immeasurably improved the lives of women in developing countries. By helping women limit the size of their families, we have enabled women to make the educational and economic gains that are essential if they, and their children, are to live longer and healthier lives. The number of women of childbearing age is increasing by 24 million every year. Now is not the time for this nation to cut back on our commitment to programs that enable women to plan their families--programs that actually reduce the incidence of abortion. And make no mistake, Mr. President, that would be one of the consequences if we pass this conference report. There would, inevitably, be an increase in the number of abortions. That is not something I want to see, and I know that every member of this body agrees with me on this point. Finally, Mr. President, it is important to note the context in which we are considering this conference report, and the implications it has for another important piece of legislation the Senate has already passed--the supplemental funding for the U.S. contribution to the International Monetary Fund. Last month, the Senate approved these funds overwhelmingly. The vote was 84-16. The size of that margin indicates the importance Senators attach to an adequately-funded IMF. Unfortunately, a small but vocal minority of members in the other body have expressed reluctance to vote on the IMF funding unless we give into their demands on the Mexico City issue. They are, in effect, holding hostage an important bill with significant national security implications, a bill that has broad, bipartisan support in the Senate, in order to force their way on a completely unrelated issue. The IMF appropriation is an insurance policy for the world economy and for countless American exporting businesses and farmers whose livelihoods depend on strong markets in Asia, Latin America, and other regions of the world. It is inappropriate and dangerous to link passage of IMF with the Mexico City restrictions. The longer we delay passage of the IMF funds, the more we expose our businesses, workers, and farmers to the risks and uncertainties of world financial markets. For all of these reasons, Mr. President, the Mexico City provision does not belong in either the State Department authorization bill, or the IMF supplemental. If the other body wishes to implement the Mexico City restrictions, it should debate those restrictions in the context in which they belong--in a comprehensive foreign aid authorization bill. They should not hold hostage every high-priority piece of foreign policy legislation moving through the Congress. It is imperative that the Senate defeat this conference report to demonstrate that we will not support such efforts at linkage either in this instance or in the future. I urge my colleagues to vote against the conference agreement.","word.count":180,"sep11":-4.42415730337079,"years":1997.43539325843,"days":867,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0145602083812619,"Topic 2":0.324611020298149,"Topic 3":0.0152587684678918,"Topic 4":0.00451853732673745,"Topic 5":0.552828987379397,"Topic 6":0.00449355389741648,"Topic 7":0.00444297228656155,"Topic 8":0.0502498536226414,"Topic 9":0.00559142675341698,"Topic 10":0.0234446715865272},{"id":"10619990006886","body":"Howard Coble: Madam Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time There is only one legislative vehicle for which this amendment is germane.

After 8 years of subordinating national security to political concerns, the Clinton-Gore administration now exits on a similar note. Three days before the election, in the face of hysterical, largely inaccurate, but extremely well-timed media lobbying blitz, the President overruled his national security experts and vetoed this bill over a provision designed to reduce damaging leaks of classified national security information. Ironically, the White House--with the full knowledge of Chief of Staff John Podesta--had previously signed off on section 304 of the Intelligence bill, the anti ``leaks'' provision that prompted the veto. Section 304, which has been public since May and which represents the product of extensive consultations with the Justice Department and the Senate Judiciary Committee, would have filled gaps in existing law by giving the Justice Department new authority to prosecute all unauthorized disclosures of classified information. Section 304 and the rest of the intelligence authorization bill were unanimously approved by the Intelligence Committee on April 27, and adopted by the full Senate without dissent on October 2. The President's Executive Office submitted to the Congress a ``Statement of Administration Policy'' in support of the leaks provision. The conference report was adopted by the Senate on October 12. Let me take a minute to explain why the committee decided, after extensive consultations with the Justice Department, to adopt this provision. While current law bars unauthorized disclosure of certain categories of information, for example, cryptographic or national defense information, many other sensitive intelligence and diplomatic secrets are not protected. And the U.S. Government, in the words of Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet, ``leaks like a sieve.'' While leakers seldom if ever face consequences for leaks, our intelligence professionals do. These range from the very real risks to the lives and freedom of U.S. intelligence officers and their sources, to the compromise of sensitive and sometimes irreplaceable intelligence collection methods. Human or technical, these sources won't be there to warn of the next terrorist attack, crisis, or war. If someone who is providing us intelligence on terrorist plans or foreign missile programs asks, ``If I give you this information, can you protect it,'' the honest answer is often ``no.'' So they may rethink, reduce, or even end their cooperation. Leaks also alienate friendly intelligence services and make them think twice before sharing sensitive information, as the National Commission on Terrorism recently concluded. Some of section 304's opponents downplay the seriousness of leaks compared to traditional espionage. Yet leaks can be even more damaging. Where a spy generally serves one customer, media leaks are available to anyone with 25 cents to buy the Washington Post, or access to an Internet connection. As important as what this legislation does is what it doesn't do. Media organizations and others have conjured up a parade of dire consequences that would ensue if section 304 had become law. Yet this carefully drafted provision would not have silenced whistle blowers, who would continue to enjoy current statutory protections, including those governing the disclosure of classified information to appropriate congressional oversight committees. Having led the move to enact whistleblower protection for intelligence community employees, I am extremely sensitive to this concern. It would not have criminalized mistakes: the provision would have applied only in cases where unauthorized disclosures are made both willfully and knowingly. That means that the person both intends and understands the nature of the act. Mistakes could not be prosecuted since they are, by definition, neither willful nor knowing. It would not have eroded first amendment rights. In particular, section 304 is not an Official Secrets Act, as some critics have alleged. Britain's Official Secrets Act authorizes the prosecution of journalists who publish classified information. Section 304, on the other hand, criminalizes the actions of persons who are charged with protecting classified information, not those who receive or publish it. Even under existing statutes, the Department of Justice rarely seeks to interview or subpoena journalists when investigating leaks. In fact, there has never been a prosecution of a journalist under existing espionage or unauthorized disclosure statutes, despite the fact that some of these current laws criminalize the actions of those who receive classified information without proper authorization. Critics also cite--correctly--the Government's tendency to overclassify information, especially embarrassing information, the disclosure of which would not damage national security, the standard for classification. But these practices are already prohibited under the current Executive order on classification, E.O. 12958, which not only provides a procedure for government employees to challenge a classification determination they believe to be improper, but encourages them to do so. The real issue is: who decides what should be classified? With commendable honesty, critic Steven Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists went beyond ritual denunciation to spell out his real concern: Section 304, as he told the Washington Post, ``turns over to the executive branch the right to determine what will be protected.'' In fact, designated officials within the executive branch have always exercised that authority. What Mr. Aftergood and the media want is to arrogate that authority to themselves and their sources. While designated classification officials may err, they--not disgruntled mid- level employees--are the ones charged under our laws and procedures with balancing the protection of our nation's secrets with the need for government openness. Mr. President, I am disappointed that President Clinton chose to veto the Intelligence Authorization Act over this provision, and I am especially disappointed at the manner in which this occurred. I believe, however, that it is in our national interest that the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 be enacted into law. Therefore, the bill before the Senate is identical to the conference report vetoed by the President, but for the ``leaks'' provision.","word.count":3108,"sep11":-2.02247191011236,"years":1999.83707865169,"days":1722,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.00700388544776783,"Topic 2":0.275814816000786,"Topic 3":0.00710718700887436,"Topic 4":0.00821200533251948,"Topic 5":0.00608074630383984,"Topic 6":0.00260839692064424,"Topic 7":0.624097553236257,"Topic 8":0.0037113873244681,"Topic 9":0.0632456016371836,"Topic 10":0.00211842078765976},{"id":"10620000026891","body":"Tom Lantos: Mr. Speaker, as President Clinton makes his way to the G- 8 Summit in Japan, there is no more important item on the agenda than to tell Mr. Putin, the President of Russia, that the persecution and the harassment of the free press in Russia must come to an end.

The Committee on Financial Services did an extensive amount of research on these issues, especially in light of the concerns raised by the Enron debacle. Several disturbing aspects about corporate disclosures in financial statements were made very clear during this process, but one of the most alarming was the unequal treatment of employees and what they were and were not allowed to do with company stock that they received in their retirement plans. I have here what will happen as a result of the CARTA bill. Pre-Enron there was little disclosure. Financial information was all in legal jargon. People could not really understand it. There was insider auditing, as we saw in the Enron case, deals made among the auditors with the company which were really not fair or right or a true representation of the actual financial situation of the company. Also, insider trading during blackouts, those executives were allowed to sell their stock; those regular people, the employees, unfortunately were not, and ended up losing a lot of money because of the deceit involved with the financial statements. Post-Enron, under the CARTA bill we have full disclosure. We also have something very important, and that is the financial information that all investors get in plain English. No more games. Under CARTA, plain English so that everybody understands exactly what is going on with the company. Also something extremely important, the independent audit versus the insider audit. We need to make sure that Americans have confidence in financial statements and invest wisely. It will also close the loophole on insider trading during blackouts. This is one of the most important things that was revealed to us during Enron, and one thing that this bill handles very well. America's investors have changed significantly. It is important for us to protect them and provide them with the information that they need. More than half of American families, that is 90 million people, invest in the stock market, including mutual funds, pensions, and 401s. This represents a growing trend. These people are investing in American companies that produce American jobs. In fact, a majority of these investors, 67 percent of them, are our average Americans with household income of $75,000 or less. Mr. Chairman, these are American families that we are talking about. We need to protect them with CARTA. According to the National Center for Employee Ownership, 10 million employees in the United States received stock options as part of their benefits in 2001. This is a 10- fold increase over 1992. This bill protects those employees and those Americans. It protects those American jobs. Finally, the benefits of the bipartisan corporate responsibility bill is greater confidence. Americans will continue to invest. We want them to invest. It is better for our future. There is more confidence for them to invest, there will be more corporate stability and the end result, which is what we all want, is more jobs and a stronger economy.","word.count":506,"sep11":0.632022471910112,"years":2002.49157303371,"days":2667,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0177391953316719,"Topic 2":0.468136143896663,"Topic 3":0.0794502065548743,"Topic 4":0.00718418154322411,"Topic 5":0.0458111232605969,"Topic 6":0.222822655924061,"Topic 7":0.0220497016466022,"Topic 8":0.0628535532392618,"Topic 9":0.0494059584654454,"Topic 10":0.0245472801376001},{"id":"10720010070107","body":"Harry Reid: Mr. President, knowing the Senator from Wisconsin as I do, and knowing the seriousness of everything he does legislatively, I want the Record to reflect my personal understanding of why he is offering this amendment and reiterating how strongly he feels about it.

The underlying bill, unfortunately, is the antithesis of the Results Act. Rather than streamlining government, it will require agencies to repeat the work they have just completed. This bill will create the very waste and duplication in our government that the bill purports to eliminate. In 1993, a Democratic Congress and a Democratic administration began an effort to reinvent our government--to make it more efficient and responsive to the American people. As a part of that effort, we passed the Government Performance and Results Act, or ``GPRA.'' This legislation had overwhelming bi-partisan support. We asked agencies to undertake strategic planning and timely performance evaluations so that we could streamline government and make it more efficient. This bill, unfortunately, is the antithesis of GPRA. Rather than streamlining government, it will require agencies to repeat the work they've just completed. Those agencies covered by GPRA--over 100 of them--have submitted their strategic plans to Congress and the Administration. According to the General Accounting Office, a non-partisan Congressional office, ``On the whole, agencies' plans appear to provide a workable foundation for Congress to use in helping to fulfill its appropriations, budget, authorization, and oversight responsibilities and . . . for the continuing implementation of the [GPRA].'' And the Office of Management and Budget testified before the Government Management, Information, and Technology subcommittee that they agreed with the GAO's assessment. If the GAO and OMB believe that these are workable strategic plans, why are we considering a bill that would require these agencies to submit new plans just a few months after the original plans were submitted. The Republicans claim that the agencies' plans are not sufficient. I have no doubt that some of the agency plans can be improved, but scrapping all of the plans is a blunderbuss that would waste taxpayer dollars. We should not ``fail'' these agencies just because we don't like what they have to say. If we have problems with these plans, then we should work with these agencies to bring their plans up to speed. We should not just tell them we don't like it and tell them to do it over. That will accomplish nothing: the majority is liable to not like the new plans, either. What are they going to do then? This amendment addresses these problems. It strikes the bill's requirement that all federal agencies revise and resubmit their strategic plans to Congress by the end of FY 1998, thereby giving Congress and the agencies sufficient time to work on improvements before the next plan must be submitted in two more years.","word.count":438,"sep11":-3.59269662921348,"years":1998.26685393258,"days":1163,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0846164066294076,"Topic 2":0.239823606317265,"Topic 3":0.0554459553607843,"Topic 4":0.173092900598312,"Topic 5":0.370860132284654,"Topic 6":0.00491422882574754,"Topic 7":0.00846211139493582,"Topic 8":0.0210072733150658,"Topic 9":0.0356695104929905,"Topic 10":0.00610787478083723},{"id":"11020070028058","body":"Speaker: Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill to establish an earned import allowance program under Public Law 109-53, and for other purposes, as amended.","word.count":105,"sep11":5.9185393258427,"years":2007.77808988764,"days":4549,"party":"Other","chamber":"","Topic 1":0.0535016277899621,"Topic 2":0.00902480970618224,"Topic 3":0.00673001183372196,"Topic 4":0.0462444956015363,"Topic 5":0.0924671628255574,"Topic 6":0.00267956801806299,"Topic 7":0.000930080401890619,"Topic 8":0.297658585565506,"Topic 9":0.00202279603760943,"Topic 10":0.48874086221997},{"id":"10720010044986","body":"Robert Byrd: Without objection, it is so ordered.","word.count":123,"sep11":-0.463483146067416,"years":2001.39606741573,"days":2277,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.24493549638977,"Topic 2":0.194525478412861,"Topic 3":0.00865853713721371,"Topic 4":0.0780882534138645,"Topic 5":0.00567393504684612,"Topic 6":0.00597857029656839,"Topic 7":0.0167298018918973,"Topic 8":0.012195640629009,"Topic 9":0.426672056228334,"Topic 10":0.00654223055363558},{"id":"10820030083524","body":"George Voinovich: It provides that if the Government employees lose the competition, they will have a right to appeal, just as the private sector has a right of appeal.

Right out of the gate, the President made it his first legislative priority to overturn a Federal ergonomics standard that was more than 10 years in the making. I am also concerned about the approach this administration has taken on the collective bargaining process through its use of the Railway Labor Act and the Taft-Hartley Act. We have also seen the reintroduction in Congress of so-called ``family friendly'' workplace bills that we all know really seek to rob working families of vital overtime pay. In March of this year, the Department of Labor proposed a regulation that builds upon these efforts to tear down worker protections by denying millions of Americans vital overtime pay. This proposed rule would change the three tests that must be met to declare a worker exempt from the wage and hour protections of the Fair Labor Standards Act, thus opening the door to denial of overtime benefits to more than 8 million workers who currently are entitled to this extra pay for working more than 40 hours per week. Under current law, a worker must meet each of three tests to be declared exempt from overtime protections. First, workers earning less than a certain level each week cannot be exempted. Second, workers must be paid a set salary, not an hourly rate, in order to be exempt. Finally, only workers whose job responsibilities are primarily classified as administrative, professional, or executive can be exempt from overtime protections. The proposed rule would reduce the educational levels required to be classified as a professional or administrative employee, thus allowing employers to substitute as little as 2 years of work experience for education when considering whether an employee should be entitled to overtime protections. I am deeply concerned that the administration continues to characterize these changes to overtime protections as ``small'' or ``insignificant.'' During an August 31 interview with National Public Radio, the Secretary of Labor said of the proposed rule, ``it's not an overtime regulation. We have many, many overtime regulations. This is not one of the major ones. This is a small part of the Fair Labor Standards Act that pertains to white collar workers. So it's got nothing to do with blue collar workers.'' The wage and hour protections of the FLSA are intended to protect all workers from being forced to work excessive hours without additional compensation. The Secretary's attempt to differentiate between white collar and blue collar workers in such a way as to imply that only blue collar workers are protected by the FLSA is troubling. According to the Economic Policy Institute, EPI: In essence, this rule would create a larger force of employees who can be required to work longer hours for less pay. This could also mean fewer opportunities for paid overtime for the workers who would remain eligible for it. The administration has claimed that they are trying simply to update and clarify the FLSA as it applies to white collar employees. According to the Secretary: It seems to me that the FLSA is abundantly clear: if a worker who is covered by the act works more than 40 hours per week, he or she is entitled to time-and-a-half pay for each extra hour worked. According to the EPI, the administration's proposed changes go far beyond simple clarifications. ``It is troubling that such dramatic losses in overtime protection are being proposed as a means of bringing clarity to the regulations and reducing litigation. As [our report] has shown--the proposed rule is rife with ambiguity and new terms--that will spawn new litigation.'' The Secretary's contention that the FLSA has not been updated in 50 years is just plain false. Congress has amended and revised the FLSA numerous times since its enactment in 1938, most recently just 3 years ago. I regret that this administration continues to characterize Federal labor protections as ``outdated'' and claims that it seeks to ``update'' them for the new century, when, in fact, many of its proposals would roll back protections for workers around the country. Who are the 8 million workers who will be affected by this proposed rule change? According to EPI, 257 ``white collar'' occupational groups could be impacted. EPI did a detailed analysis of the effect of this rule on 78 of those occupational groups and found that 2.5 million salaried employees and 5.5 million hourly workers would lose their overtime protections under the proposed rule. And that is less than half of the occupational groups that would be covered by this rule change. By broadening the FLSA wage and hour exemptions, the Department of Labor is seeking to deny overtime benefits to a wide range of workers, including police officers, firefighters, and other first responders, nurses and other health care workers, postmasters, preschool teachers, and social workers, just to name a few. I am deeply troubled that the administration would propose a rule that would deny overtime benefits to the people who put their lives on the line each and every day to protect our communities and those who work in health care professions, which, of course, as we know, already are facing severe staffing shortages. I am also disappointed that the Office of Management and Budget issued a ``Statement of Administration Policy'' document on this bill that states that the President's advisers would recommend that he veto this important appropriations bill if the Harkin amendment is adopted. I think it is irresponsible to threaten to veto a bill that includes crucial funding for labor, health, and education programs because the administration, apparently, is digging in its heels about a proposal that would deny millions of Americans overtime pay. I regret that this administration is so determined to undermine labor protections for American workers that it would actually threaten to deny funding for schools, health care, job training, and other programs that it regularly claims are a priority. I urge my colleagues to support working families by supporting the Harkin amendment. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.","word.count":1031,"sep11":2.04494382022472,"years":2003.90449438202,"days":3170,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0973876297955021,"Topic 2":0.484875074002891,"Topic 3":0.00868258385109809,"Topic 4":0.184029854922609,"Topic 5":0.0851998557752809,"Topic 6":0.00456477057122874,"Topic 7":0.00432443567649455,"Topic 8":0.112825484718289,"Topic 9":0.00844299635680518,"Topic 10":0.00966731432980185},{"id":"10820030028835","body":"Denise Majette: Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 7, 2003, and under a previous order of the House, the following Members will be recognized for 5 minutes each.","word.count":575,"sep11":2.03089887640449,"years":2003.8904494382,"days":3165,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0835433277124175,"Topic 2":0.308740659175697,"Topic 3":0.00555617993048488,"Topic 4":0.0289946288749576,"Topic 5":0.00514614221142835,"Topic 6":0.00538619750460248,"Topic 7":0.502161097791094,"Topic 8":0.004766294849334,"Topic 9":0.0532427940147375,"Topic 10":0.00246267793524667},{"id":"10519980085627","body":"Ron Wyden: Mr. President, in November 1996, there was a tragic accident off the coast of California that claimed the lives of 10 out of 11 airmen, the crew of an Air Force Reserve C-130 aircraft out of Portland. All of these crewmen were from my home state of Oregon. This was a devastating loss for all of us, but most of all for the families of those airmen who lost their lives. After any tragedy like this, the first question on everyone's minds is ``why?'' Why were my loved ones taken from me? This is what the families of these airmen wanted to know, but no one would give them a straight answer. After many, many months of frustration, these families came to me and my colleague from Oregon, Senator Smith, to get the Air Force to tell us exactly what happened. As a result of working with these families, with the Air Force, and with the committee staff, and with Senator Levin in particular, we were able to craft some language that is now included in the Defense Authorization Conference Report that we are considering today. This language takes a two pronged approach to dealing with the pressing issues the families have raised: improving crash investigations, and eliminating the secrecy in which these investigations are shrouded. Specifically, the language directs the Defense Department to review the way it conducts aviation accident investigations so that they are conducted in as thorough and objective a manner as possible, including making sure crash investigators receive the best training, and ensuring that the military department coordinate and share information on fleet safety. The bill also urges the Pentagon to seek the advice of the National Transportation Safety Board in improving investigation procedures, and I intend to make sure their valuable input is part of their review. Secrecy has long been the hallmark of these investigations and has kept loved ones in the dark about what happened and why. We have worked to reduce the secrecy involved in the investigations of tragedies, and this legislation takes a solid step forward in providing families and the public with better information. That's why this language also requires the Department of Defense to issue regulations to provide to family members periodic reports on the progress of investigations. I also spoke with Secretary Cohen about this recently, and he has pledged to make a solid effort to make sure families are kept informed of the progress of investigations. It's important that we eliminate secrecy from these proceedings. The last thing we should do is add to these terrible tragedies by keeping the families in the dark about the status of these investigations. From day to day, from week to week, from month to month, these families had to cope with not only the incredible pain of losing a loved one, but with the incredible frustration of not knowing the status of the investigation into their deaths. This new language seeks to put an end to this type of treatment. We owe it to the men and women who give their lives for their country.","word.count":515,"sep11":-3.02247191011236,"years":1998.83707865169,"days":1366,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0268204546714175,"Topic 2":0.366109508162828,"Topic 3":0.0137112573294353,"Topic 4":0.0092610358783657,"Topic 5":0.14367817420547,"Topic 6":0.00805226328417702,"Topic 7":0.010852818310891,"Topic 8":0.294767160534656,"Topic 9":0.0738299987355912,"Topic 10":0.0529173288871681},{"id":"11020070026162","body":"Tom Feeney: Mr. Speaker, in the interest of full disclosure, my side of the aisle is looking at every conceivable opportunity under the House rules and in any reasonable parlance of conversation to talk about energy. So when we're beginning this conversation today, follow me along, because we're going to start about Native American housing, but eventually, the conversation is going to turn to energy. And why is that? It's true, Mr. Speaker, because that's what the entire country is talking about, and that's what the entire country, I would submit, wants the House to focus its, no pun intended, energy on. So follow me, if you will. When the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 was passed, it reorganized housing assistance for Native Americans by eliminating several disparate Federal assistance programs and replacing them with the Indian Housing Block Grant program. In the underlying statute, section 202 specifies eligible affordable housing activities for the block grant program, with the goal of developing, operating, maintaining, or supporting affordable housing or homeownership. Further, section 202 of S. 2062 amends current law and expands the eligible affordable housing activities under the statute. The language of the aforementioned bill would give tribes more flexibility under the Act by allowing a recipient to utilize funds not only for the acquisition and new construction of affordable housing, but it would also allow tribes to utilize block grant funds for the development and rehabilitation of utilities and necessary infrastructure to achieve greater energy efficiency. Native Americans in this country are facing serious housing problems. Last Congress, the Financial Services Committee held several hearings to investigate the housing situation in Indian lands, which are the result of widespread poverty, high unemployment, homelessness, and a lack of affordable housing on Native American lands. In addition to reorganizing the program, the statute sought to provide Native Americans the right to self-determination and self-governance by allowing tribes to have greater freedom over their tribal housing. Reauthorization is an important step in addressing many of these issues. Like every American today, Mr. Speaker, Native Americans are struggling with the high cost of energy. Whether on tribal lands or in suburban America, families are grappling with the escalating cost of energy in today's economy and the effect it has on maintaining housing affordability. Rising energy costs associated with renting or owning a home and the transportation cost of traveling back and forth from home to work are having a devastating impact on everyone's budget, including families in Indian country. So the conversation then surrounds itself around greater flexibility and enhancing, literally, the opportunity for Native Americans to pursue energy solutions, particularly as it relates to utilities. And why is this important? This is important, Mr. Speaker, because we need to take a holistic approach. We need to pursue every conceivable, reasonable energy alternative, Mr. Speaker. We've got to make sure that we don't leave any solutions on the table and we pursue everything. So, for example, yesterday we had a hearing in the Financial Services Committee where the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Chairman Bernanke, came in and commented on a wide range of elements of the economy. But what was particularly interesting, I found, among other things, was the assertion that he made when he said this: that if we increase production of oil by 1 percent, he anticipates a 10 percent drop in price. Let me say that again. I'm going to say that two more times, it's so unbelievable. A 1 percent increase in production, according to the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, who we defer on many things in our economy, he said would create a 10 percent decrease in price. A 1 percent increase in production would create a 10 percent decrease in price. That is a staggering assertion from the person that both sides of the aisle give a great deal of deference to, both sides of the aisle listen to and consult with and are very interested in his comments. And he says, again, a 1 percent increase in production creates a 10 percent decrease in price. So how does the motion to instruct weave into this? The motion to instruct is part of a broader conversation on energy, and I think what my side of the aisle is trying to assert in this and in other bills obviously that have come before the floor in the past several days, Mr. Speaker, is that when it comes to energy and when it comes to solutions, we need a holistic approach, and not to allow ourselves to be hidebound by an orthodoxy that has developed among some elements that are driving the other side of the aisle, to say, well, we're not going to pursue those things, those are not on the table, we're not going to pursue enhanced production, we're not going to pursue clean coal technologies, we're not going to pursue some of these other technologies that are so dynamic and are so vibrant. So I have done my best, Mr. Speaker, to weave the energy debate into this motion to instruct. With that, I reserve the balance of my time.","word.count":777,"sep11":5.90168539325843,"years":2007.76123595506,"days":4543,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.148227642361917,"Topic 2":0.288100058447829,"Topic 3":0.00215920207728754,"Topic 4":0.0254118828815955,"Topic 5":0.0033655107313016,"Topic 6":0.0372968972423246,"Topic 7":0.0176843659377129,"Topic 8":0.00517879644841928,"Topic 9":0.471334643529909,"Topic 10":0.0012410003417034},{"id":"11020080029474","body":"Ric Keller: Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Florida, Mr. Diaz-Balart, for yielding time. Mr. Speaker, as the ranking member on the House Higher Education Subcommittee, and a member of the conference committee, I rise today in strong support of this bipartisan Higher Education Opportunity Act, which is the first reauthorization of the Higher Education Act in 10 years. I also appreciate the regular order we have followed with respect to the rule on this bill. I support this important legislation for three key reasons. First, it allows year-round Pell Grants for students who wish to complete their education more quickly. Second, it reduces burdensome red tape on students and families by providing a much shorter, simpler application for Federal student financial aid. And third, it includes my legislation to curb wasteful spending by closing a loophole that had allowed convicted child predators to receive Federal financial aid to take college courses. I am going to limit my remarks this morning to the wasteful spending issue. It is a national embarrassment that we are wasting taxpayer dollars for child molesters and rapists to take college courses, while hardworking young people from lower and middle income families are flipping hamburgers to pay for college. I have been working to close this loophole for years. And today, the most insane, wasteful spending program in America comes to an end. This legislation ensures that taxpayer money for Pell Grants will go to low and middle income students, not dangerous sexual predators. Let me give you a real life example. James Sturtz is one of the most violent sexual predators in America, and he is currently locked up in a Wisconsin facility. He was convicted and sent to prison for raping a 4- year-old girl. After being released from prison, he raped a woman at knife-point, and was sent to prison a second time. After being released, he met a college student waiting for a bus, persuaded her to get in his car and then raped her at knife-point. He was then sent back to prison for a third time, and after his sentence ended in 2006, he was locked up in a civil confinement center to be held there indefinitely. Sturtz and several other locked up sexual predators decided to exploit the civil confinement loophole and obtain thousands of dollars in Federal Pell Grants to take college courses, like algebra, through the mail. Then, Sturtz and two-thirds of the other inmates dropped their classes and used our taxpayer money to buy blue jeans, music CDs, movie DVDs, radios, television sets and DVD players. Of course, even if they hadn't dropped their classes, there is zero evidence that violent sexual predators who take algebra and calculus classes have lower recidivism rates. Well, how could this loophole happen in the first place? Prison inmates have been ineligible for Pell Grants since 1994. In 20 States, including Florida and Wisconsin, they wisely hold the most violent repeated sexual predators indefinitely in civil confinement centers after they serve their regular prison sentence because they are likely to repeat their crimes if released back into society. For example, in my home State of Florida, 54 violent sexual predators obtained over $200,000 in Pell Grants at taxpayer expense in 1 year alone. Similar expenditures in the other 20 States with civil confinement means millions of dollars being wasted, until now. This was a team effort. I would like to especially thank ranking member Buck McKeon, Chairman George Miller, as well as the other members of the conference committee and our hardworking professional staff members for working in a bipartisan spirit to include this provision and so many other worthy provisions in this legislation. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reauthorize the Higher Education Act and vote yes on H.R. 4137.","word.count":635,"sep11":7.06460674157303,"years":2008.92415730337,"days":4957,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0193678562450699,"Topic 2":0.313266059572993,"Topic 3":0.0223506706095385,"Topic 4":0.00674421762035268,"Topic 5":0.0327485780370078,"Topic 6":0.276475205858983,"Topic 7":0.0135754376019237,"Topic 8":0.0226955562874643,"Topic 9":0.286260241586304,"Topic 10":0.00651617658036356},{"id":"10720020054529","body":"Olympia Snowe: Thank you, Mr. President That is an important point, that we are now creating this type of penalty for low-income seniors, because if they earn $1 more, they lose their prescription drug coverage. Finally, employer-sponsored plans, labor-union sponsored plans, will be penalized under this legislation. There will be a disincentive for employers and labor unions to continue their coverage. You might ask, why? I will answer that question. Because now, under this legislation before us, they have revamped the standard for how you calculate your out-of-pocket cost for the catastrophic level of $3,300. These plans will not be counted toward the out-of-pocket costs. So employers will not have an incentive to continue these programs. And certainly employees would not want to because they would not want to lose their coverage. Labor unions will drop their plans. So that is another disincentive. Now 23 percent of retirees have such coverage. We do not want to create a disincentive for the continuation of those programs. But that is exactly what this Graham proposal will do that is before this Senate today. That is why I am urging my colleagues not to support this initiative. Allow us to go back to where we were on Friday, continuing the discussions we were holding across the aisle with our tripartisan group, with Senator Breaux, Senator Jeffords, Senator Grassley, Senator Hatch, Senator Baucus, Senator Kennedy, Senator Wyden, and others, so that we can have a comprehensive plan for all Medicare beneficiaries, with universal coverage that the AARP and all of us have embraced for the last 37 years with the existence of the Medicare Program. This isn't the last vote. This can be the beginning. And I cannot imagine this Senate, in September, considering a Medicare give-back to providers and not considering a prescription drug program for our Nation's seniors. They deserve better.

There have been some suggestions that we are motivated for political purposes in 1995 to raise this issue. The history of these efforts conclusively refutes that contention. A bill was introduced on October 1, 1983, S. 2031, cosponsored at that time by 50 United States Senators, which sought to have the United States Embassy and the residence of the American Ambassador to Israel hereafter be located in the city of Jerusalem. That resolution was referred to committee and was not called for a vote, but it was later noted that in addition to the 50 U.S. Senators, there were 227 Members of the House of Representatives who joined in endorsing that transfer of the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Then on March 26, 1990, Senate Concurrent Resolution 106 was introduced, which called for the recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and that resolution was passed in the Senate by a voice vote. Then, following those actions, on February 24, 1995, a letter was sent to Secretary of State Warren Christopher signed by 92 U.S. Senators evidencing strong bipartisan support, again calling for the moving of the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Mr. President, I was an original cosponsor of S. 2031 which was introduced back on October 31, 1983; supported Senate Concurrent Resolution 106 back in 1990; and joined in the letter of February 24, 1995, evidencing my consistent support for this program. Recently, the Prime Minister of Israel, Yitzhak Rabin, was in Washington, and the issue was raised as to whether or not action by the Congress of the United States in calling for the removal of the Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem would be an impediment to the peace process which is ongoing at the present time because obviously we do not wish to interfere with the peace process. At that time, Prime Minister Rabin responded that it was a [[Page S6793]] matter for U.S. Congressmen, Senators and Representatives, to express themselves as they saw fit. He did not appear perturbed that action in this way would be an impediment to the peace process in the Mideast. The negotiators of Israel and the PLO are scheduled, as I understand it, to take up the status of Jerusalem approximately a year from now. I think there is no doubt about the Israeli position that Jerusalem is an undivided city, and certainly I think there is no doubt in the Congress of the United States about Jerusalem being an undivided city and it being the judgment of Israel as to where its capital should be. The tradition is, the unbroken tradition is that the embassies are located in the capital city, and it is a fundamental matter therefore that the United States Embassy and the Ambassador's residence ought to be located in the capital of Israel just as the Embassy and Ambassador's residence are located in the capital city of every nation with the host nation determining where its capital should be. We have to make decisions on matters of this sort, Mr. President, as we see it. There is no doubt about the strong relationship between the United States and Israel, but judgments need to be made by Senators and Congressmen as to what we think is appropriate. Many of us have joined over the years in urging that the Embassy be moved to Jerusalem, and I think that the record is consistent over such a long period of time that there is no appropriate way someone could make a claim that it is a matter for political purposes. The distinguished majority leader, Senator Dole, has been singled out in a number of newspaper editorials, others of us less prominent than the majority leader have not been so identified, but I am confident that all of us in exercising our judgment in calling for the location of the U.S. Embassy to be in Jerusalem instead of Tel Aviv are doing it because we think it is the appropriate course of conduct, and no one, no fairminded person, can say that when the record goes back to 1983 in the endorsement of this resolution, there could be any political motivation. I think that ought to be considered and the record ought to be set straight on this issue.","word.count":757,"sep11":-6.48595505617978,"years":1995.37359550562,"days":133,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.234473919150252,"Topic 2":0.0359590370585759,"Topic 3":0.0295328739448026,"Topic 4":0.00555257578510389,"Topic 5":0.00816783132180543,"Topic 6":0.00774927648988966,"Topic 7":0.00295616433222669,"Topic 8":0.662751701351261,"Topic 9":0.00752862705031791,"Topic 10":0.00532799351576526},{"id":"10920060005160","body":"Candice Miller: Mr. Speaker, yesterday congressional Democrats outlined their agenda to better secure America.

Gas prices have risen 75 percent since Nancy Pelosi took over. Where is the energy independence Democrats promised 2 years ago? That's the subheadline. Now I am going to quote from the article. In November, 2006, House Speaker-Elect Nancy Pelosi issued a press release touting the Democrats ``common-sense plan to help bring down skyrocketing gas prices.'' She accused the oil companies of price gouging. The price of gasoline, when the Democrats took control of Congress, was around $2.25 per gallon. The average price of regular gas crept over the $4 per gallon barrier over the weekend, as measured by AAA and the Oil Price Information Service. This represents a more than 75 percent increase in the retail price of a gallon of gasoline on Pelosi's watch. Call it the Pelosi premium we are all now paying.

Is what is being proposed in the best interest of our Nation, and is it likely to achieve the desired results in the country in question--in this case, Cuba? I have had grave concerns, Mr. President, about title III of this bill. That [[Page S 15325]] section has been taken out. I thank my colleagues for supporting us in that effort. Notwithstanding, however, Mr. President, this changed. The two basic questions I raised at the outset of these remarks remain. In my view, the answer to both of those questions, if one reads this bill carefully, is ``no.'' It is not in our interest to complicate our relations with the governments of Russia or other New Independent State countries. Yet, provisions of this bill would do just that by linking our assistance to these countries, to their policies toward Cuba. We provide, Mr. President, assistance to Russia, and other of the New Independent States, because we want to see them carry out the kinds of programs that we are funding, because we want to continue to strengthen their still fragile democratic institutions. Conditioning, Mr. President, that assistance on what is going on in Cuba, I think, is counterproductive. Provisions of this bill ultimately hinge on our arms control treaties with Russia, specifically, on Russian verification of United States compliance. While it is certainly legitimate for the United States to discuss the types of activities that appropriately fall within the scope of verification of arms control treaties, that should be done bilaterally with the Government of Russia, not unilaterally imposed by the Congress in the context of a debate about Cuba. Other provisions of this bill bar Cuban participation in international financial institutions until after democracy has been established in that country. We all know, Mr. President, the critical roles played by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in the early days of Russia's transition to democracy. It is foolhardy, Mr. President, to prohibit the IMF and the World Bank from offering their assistance and expertise to a post-Castro government as it grapples with the complicated task of dismantling a command economy. Mr. President, I have already mentioned those provisions of the bill which my amendment would have sought to strike, provisions that severely limit the flexibility of the United States to respond to the change in Cuba when it comes. This bill could also have the United States spend more money on TV Marti, this time converting from VHF to UHF broadcasting. We all know that TV Marti has been a complete failure. GAO report after GAO report after GAO report has found that it is totally ineffective, that virtually nobody watches it, and that it is a total waste of taxpayer money. More than just the individual provisions of the bill, Mr. President, the entire thrust of this legislation makes no sense whatsoever. Calling Castro names does not get Cuba any closer to democracy. We have spent a week debating this. It is too long. Perhaps the only individual who will truly benefit from this debate is Fidel Castro. Once again, we have managed to make him larger than life. Once again, we have given him excuses on why his government has failed and why the Cuban economy is in a shambles. Once again, we will force our allies to come to his defense because they profoundly disagree with our tactics. None of this, Mr. President, makes any sense whatsoever. We all know that to be the case, but frankly, to state it bluntly, because of domestic political considerations, we continue to take actions counterproductive to our own self-interest. I urge defeat of this amendment. I yield the floor.","word.count":640,"sep11":-6.05056179775281,"years":1995.80898876404,"days":288,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0867270886847182,"Topic 2":0.307444632387929,"Topic 3":0.0234427444030434,"Topic 4":0.0891442019148487,"Topic 5":0.211801597571328,"Topic 6":0.006736188548362,"Topic 7":0.00869510786355399,"Topic 8":0.0329945172797261,"Topic 9":0.016122583010481,"Topic 10":0.21689133833601},{"id":"10920060057131","body":"John Thune: Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada, Mr Ensign, for his leadership on this issue and for yielding time and for bringing this important matter before the Senate. My colleague from California mentioned that this is an election year ploy. But I think the last time this was voted on in the Senate was in 1998. That was a cloture vote. I don't know that there has ever been an up-or-down vote in the Senate. It has been voted on in the House. I think most people see this particular provision as something that is a commonsense approach to this issue. Obviously, there are a lot of labels that are thrown around in this very contentious debate in our country. But when it comes to this particular issue, the courts have laid out some parameters under which States can operate when it comes to statutes that they adopted that impose conditions and restrictions on abortion. The undue burden requirement that came out of the Planned Parenthood v. Casey decision many years ago created this scenario where if there is not an undue burden, that statutes enacted by States can impose restrictions. And many States have done that. One that many States have adopted is the issue of parental consent or parental notification. In fact, there are about 37 States to date that have adopted in some fashion that particular legislation. Thirty-seven States have enacted statutes imposing legal obligations on pregnant minors to notify or gain the consent of their parents before getting an abortion. S. 403, which we are debating today, does not supercede or otherwise alter any of those laws, nor does it impose any parental notice or consent requirement on any State. These are States that adopted these laws. The bill would only give effect to a State's parental involvement law if that law is constitutional. Therefore, any State parental consent law given effect under this bill must contain a judicial bypass provision which allows the minor girl to petition a judge to waive the parental notification requirement. Just to give you an example of States that have enacted these types of laws, my State of South Dakota, for example, requires that a minor under the age of 18 have the consent of one parent or judicial bypass to obtain an abortion. States in my region and neighboring States such as North Dakota, require the same thing, only it requires two parents' consent or judicial bypass. Nebraska requires essentially the consent of one parent or judicial bypass. Iowa requires that a minor must have the consent of one parent or grandparent or judicial bypass. Wyoming requires that a minor under the age of a eighteen must have the consent of one parent or judicial bypass. In Minnesota you must have the consent of two parents or judicial bypass. Montana, again, one parent or judicial bypass. My point very simply is that the States and State legislatures have found, within their purview, ways that are constitutional to address what is a very gripping issue for the country, one that has created a great deal, obviously, of debate for the past 30 some years, and I suspect will continue to be debated not only here in legislative bodies but in front of the courts. The courts have laid out a framework, a set of parameters. States have acted accordingly. All this simply does is reinforce those State laws and allow parents to be involved in probably what, without argument, has to be one of the most consequential decisions a teenager will ever make. As a parent of two teenage daughters, we talk about everything. We talk about where our children want to go to college. I have a teenager who is starting college this year. We talk about who they hang out with on a regular basis. We talk about what they wear, obviously, their apparel. We talk about who they date. We talk about who they associate with, all the decisions that they make in their lives on a daily basis. We try to stay very involved and engaged in their lives, for obvious reasons, because that is important as a parent. I have a 16-year-old who will be a junior in high school. Ironically, in 27 States in this country, my 16-year-old can't get a tattoo without the permission of a parent. In 27 States, my 16-year-old cannot get her body pierced without permission of a parent. Yet we would allow what, arguably, would be the most consequential decision that child could ever make to go without consultation with a parent. It seems to me that common sense dictates, and I think most people around this country would agree, whatever side of this issue they find themselves on, this is a very common sense way to proceed. Allowing someone to essentially bypass a parent and take a minor, a teenager, across the State line to have an abortion is something that crosses not only State lines but crosses the lines of what most Americans would concede makes common sense when it comes to the way we raise our children and the kind of culture we want to have in our country. I have to say I sure as heck as a parent would not want some other person taking one of my daughters somewhere to have this procedure when the emotional, the health, the medical ramifications of that decision could be so consequential in terms of my daughters, or any daughter, any teenager or any minor's future. I cannot imagine that this does not meet the common sense threshold, the test that most Americans would apply--again, irrespective of what side they find themselves on this particular issue. If you look at this bill, and ultimately what it is designed to do, there are several things that would happen. I believe, if this act passed, it would substantially cut down on the number of minors who obtain abortions. It has been shown that parental involvement laws can decrease abortions among minors by 8 to 9 percent. Furthermore, Senate bill 403 will likely magnify that effect since minors often cross State lines to evade their home State laws. The bill does not infringe on States' rights. It merely gives teeth to existing State laws. In fact, the Federal Government will prosecute individuals in violation of this act. Senate bill 403 does not mandate individual States to enforce laws which they have not passed. Additionally, this legislation does not criminalize doctors or the young women who obtain abortions. It prosecutes only those who take minors across State lines in an effort to evade parental involvement laws. In States that do not have parental notification laws, nearly 40 percent of minors keep their pregnancies secret. Since abortion is a major surgical operation, I believe parents need to know if their daughters undergo an abortion so they will be able to help them with any potential complications, including both the physical, emotional, and mental complications that can arise from the procedure. In cases where this would be inappropriate because of an abusive relationship, the judicial bypass is still an option. Senate bill 403 will help parents keep their daughters out of inappropriate and/or predatory relationships. The American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Adolescents estimates that almost two-thirds of adolescent mothers have partners over the age of 20. Additionally, in 58 percent of cases where a daughter does not notify her parents of her pregnancy, her boyfriend is the one who accompanies her for the abortion. Combining those two statistics suggests a substantial number of abortions are obtained in an attempt to avoid statutory rape laws. Underage children cannot obtain an aspirin at school without parental consent, but nothing prevents a minor from being transported from her current State where parental consent is required to another State where she can legally obtain an abortion without any parental consent. That is what this legislation intends to correct. Abortion clinics in States where there are no parental consent laws actually advertise in States requiring parental consent by using ``no parental consent required'' ads. This legislation is not unreasonable. As I said earlier, 27 States require a minor, a person under the age of 18 today, to obtain parental consent to get a tattoo. Essentially, 27 States also require minors, persons under the age of 18, to get parental consent to get piercings, including ear piercings. It seems to me, again, as a parent of two teenage daughters, as well as someone who is observing the debate we have in this country over this particular issue, this is a reasonable, commonsense approach, a measure that has been discussed and debated, the constitutionality of it addressed. My colleague from California, Senator Boxer, said this is unconstitutional. As I said before, the courts have said as long as it does not impose an undue burden, these types of restrictions fit within the parameters of what is constitutional. Furthermore, under the Commerce Clause, the way this particular bill is worded fits within that constitutional framework. I don't think that is a valid argument. One of the arguments that was made, as well, by my colleague from California had to do with the issue of incest. A judge found Arizona Planned Parenthood negligent for failing to report to Child Protective Services an abortion performed on a 13-year-old girl in foster care. This girl's case dates back to 1998 when she went in for an abortion at a Planned Parenthood abortion facility accompanied by her 23-year-old foster brother with whom she was having a sexual relationship. Planned Parenthood did not notify authorities until the girl returned 6 months later for a second abortion, according to court records. There are lots of examples that can be used, obviously, to support what this legislation attempts to accomplish. As I said before, this issue has not been debated in the Senate for some time, although I will say it has been acted on by the Congress--not in the Senate but by the House of Representatives. The House earlier this year passed this bill by 270 to 157 or something like that, and had voted in 1998, 1999, and 2002.

Valeo. I had intended to comment on January 29, the anniversary date of that decision which established as a principle of constitutional law that any individual could spend as much of his or her money in a campaign as he or she chose. That issue was a matter of substantial consternation to me when the decision was handed down and, I think, remains a major impediment on public policy in the United States on the way we run our election campaigns, where, realistically viewed, any seat is up for sale. There have been many, many examples of multimillion-dollar expenditures in this body, the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and in State Government, and now we are witnessing one for the Presidency of the United States. The fact of life is, if you advertise enough on television, if you sell candidacies like you sell soap, the sky is the limit. Even the White House of the United States of America, the Office of the President, may be, in fact, up for sale if someone is willing to start off by announcing a willingness to spend $25 million. If you have $400 million, that is not an enormous sum; you have $375 million left. Somebody might be able to get along on that. You might spend $50 million or even $75 million to promote a candidacy, both to articulate a positive view and then, perhaps even more effectively, to articulate a negative view. This is a subject I have been concerned about for a long time because I filed for the U.S. Senate back in 1975 announcing my candidacy for the U.S. Senate on November 17, 1975, in the first election cycle where the 1974 election law was in effect. At that time the spending limitation applied to what an individual could spend, and, for a State the size of Pennsylvania, it was $35,000. I decided to run for the office of U.S. Senate against a very distinguished American who later became a U.S. Senator, John Heinz. After my election in 1980, he and I formed a very close working partnership and very close friendship. I have only the best things to say about Senator Heinz. But, in the middle of that campaign, on January 29, 1976, the Supreme Court of the United States decided Buckley v. Valeo and said a candidate can spend any amount of money. My later colleague was in a position to do so and did just that. That made an indelible impression upon me, so much so that when the decision came down on January 29, I petitioned for leave to intervene as amicus and filed a set of legal appeals, all of which were denied. But it seemed to me since that time, as I have watched enormous expenditures in campaign financing by individuals, that simply was unsound constitutional law and certainly unsound public policy. There is nothing in the Constitution, in my legal judgement, which guarantees freedom of speech on any reasonable, realistic, logical constitutional interpretation which says you ought to be able to spend as much money that you have to win an elective office. I think it is high time for the Congress of the United States and the 50 States to reexamine that in a constitutional amendment, which is currently pending. Senator Hollings has proposed the amendment for many Congresses, and I have joined with him and sometimes I have proposed individual constitutional amendments. But as we approach the 20th anniversary of Buckley v. Valeo, we ought to take a very serious look at it. And we may have a striking impetus for change in that law by the Presidential campaign which is currently underway. So, in advance of the 29th, I urge my colleagues to take a very close look at this issue which I think has very serious implications for the electoral process in America. I thank the Chair. It is now 3:40. I yield the floor.","word.count":678,"sep11":-5.78089887640449,"years":1996.07865168539,"days":384,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.132408362495956,"Topic 2":0.0335403340490044,"Topic 3":0.00457630929978529,"Topic 4":0.806517503663031,"Topic 5":0.00223899584695665,"Topic 6":0.00216738141357497,"Topic 7":0.00411399634465289,"Topic 8":0.00515432986049793,"Topic 9":0.00651156018753441,"Topic 10":0.00277122683900661},{"id":"10419960054565","body":"Phil Gramm: Mr. President, we are talking basically today about crime, though I heard Senator Gorton speak on another subject, and obviously an important one. He mentioned Pericles of Athens and, I would only add, O that the Lord would send us a Pericles now that we really need one. But we are here today basically talking about crime, and I want to touch on three issues. I want to express frustration about two of them. For the last 6 years, as we have debated crime bills, I have offered two amendments that have passed the Senate with overwhelming votes. They both relate to mandatory minimum sentencing. The first amendment addresses the same issue the President addressed this morning in Florida, and that is the problem we have with children and drugs. The amendment I have offered recognizes the fact that there is a drug pusher almost literally standing at the doorway of every junior high school in America. In addition, increasingly drug pushers use children to deliver the drug and to take the cash, because it is at that point of transaction, where the exchange between money and drugs actually occurs, that you have the strongest possibility of prosecution. And so, what is increasingly happening in our country is not only are drug pushers exploiting our children by selling drugs outside the doorway--and sometimes inside the doorway--of what would seem to be every junior high school in America, but increasingly our children are being used in drug conspiracies to actually transfer the drug and take the money. Recognizing this incredible tragedy, I have repeatedly offered an amendment to require 10 years in prison without parole for selling drugs to a minor or for using a minor in drug trafficking or a drug conspiracy. Two years ago I strengthened that amendment to add life imprisonment without parole on a repeat offense. The thing I think would be most stunning for people to know is that while we have adopted my amendment on minimum mandatory sentencing for selling drugs to children or using our children in drug sales, every time we have debated a crime bill this decade, that amendment has been adopted, and yet it has never become the law of the land. In fact, in President Clinton's so-called crime bill, in 1994, Congress overturned minimum mandatory sentencing for drug felons and, by giving discretion to judges, in essence, guaranteed that the minimum sentencing provisions we had, were largely eliminated. This spring and summer we are going to debate crime again. I want to put my colleagues on notice. I am going to offer this amendment again: 10 years in prison without parole for selling drugs to a minor or using a minor in drug trafficking; life imprisonment without parole on the second offense. I am not going to stop until, this year, we make that amendment the law of the land. The second provision, which I have offered now for the better part of a decade--and it normally gets an overwhelming majority in the Senate, but it never becomes law--is 10 years in prison without parole for possessing a firearm during the commission of a violent crime or a drug felony; 20 years for discharging the firearm; life imprisonment without parole for killing somebody, and, in aggravated cases, the death penalty. That provision has consistently been adopted, but what always happens is in the conference committee, where we work out the differences between the Senate bill and the House bill, it ends up being dropped. I do not intend to see that happen this year. We have proven in the District of Columbia and all over the planet that gun control does not work. But if we add 10 years in prison without parole for simply possessing a firearm during a violent crime or drug felony, in addition to the penalty for the violent crime and drug felony, if we add 20 years for discharging the firearm, if we had the death penalty for killing somebody, we could begin to do something about gun violence in America. I am ready. The Senate has been ready, at least in terms of the public votes we cast. But in the private votes, in conference committee, this provision, year after year after year, has been dropped. It is time for that to stop. Finally, I want to put prisoners to work in America. It seems that every year somebody offers an amendment--normally, our dear colleague from North Carolina, Senator Helms--to ban trade with some country that uses prison labor, and every year I wonder why we cannot use prison labor. We have 1.1 million people in prison in America, yet we have three Federal statutes, all arising out of the Depression era, that criminalize prison labor in America: the Hawes-Cooper Act, the Sumners- Ashurst Act, and the Walsh-Healey Public Contracting Act. Each effectively limits our ability to have people work in prison to produce goods for sale. One bill says it is a felony if you produce something in prison and send it across State lines; another bill limits the transport of such goods; another limits the use of prison labor in regard to Federal contracts. Converted into English, what that says it that it is illegal to make prisoners work. I do not understand that. I want to repeal these three statutes. I want to turn our prisons into industrial parks. I want to make prisoners work 10 hours a day, 6 days a week, and I want to make them go to school at night. We spent $22,000 a year last year to keep somebody in the Federal penitentiary. If we stop building prisons like Holiday Inns, if we make prisoners work, I believe we could cut that cost by 50 percent in 5 years, and cut it by three-quarters in 10 years, and I think that ought to be our objective. So I think it is time to stop talking about the crime problem and start doing something about it. I remind my colleagues that last year in the Commerce, State, Justice appropriations bill, the committee adopted an amendment that I authored that would repeal these three laws. But guess what happened? It was not in the final version of the bill. The same thing that has happened on minimum mandatory sentencing for selling drugs to children, the same thing that has happened on minimum mandatory sentencing for gun violence. We cast votes in the Senate--in public everybody says, ``Great,'' they are really serious about this problem--and then some of our most senior Members meet in the dark, dingy corners of some room here in this magnificent building and these great proposals die. I believe the time has come for that to stop. I think these are three changes that need to be made, and I intend to continue to fight for them. It is our Republican agenda. I want to make it happen. I thank our colleague from Georgia for his great leadership, and I yield the floor.","word.count":1168,"sep11":-5.50842696629214,"years":1996.35112359551,"days":481,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.514478696878192,"Topic 2":0.292089638417128,"Topic 3":0.0125602537020948,"Topic 4":0.0130438556446082,"Topic 5":0.112167748486615,"Topic 6":0.0189281947212296,"Topic 7":0.00644590731149804,"Topic 8":0.0158762963848512,"Topic 9":0.00858534630417734,"Topic 10":0.00582406214960417},{"id":"10419950071108","body":"Dave Weldon: Without objection, it is so ordered The Presiding Officer appointed Mr. Chafee, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Warner, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Reid, and Mr. Lautenberg conferees on the part of the Senate.","word.count":921,"sep11":-5.87640449438202,"years":1995.98314606742,"days":350,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0399530667021531,"Topic 2":0.0363739667768263,"Topic 3":0.117074393819195,"Topic 4":0.139052100024954,"Topic 5":0.334347292069241,"Topic 6":0.00429082946947381,"Topic 7":0.0564359570020203,"Topic 8":0.0305217575812428,"Topic 9":0.175100896089288,"Topic 10":0.066849740465606},{"id":"10620000072471","body":"Trent Lott: Mr. President, let me say we are going to try to clear that bill so we can get it into conference with the House.

That is the practice of passing children on to the next grade regardless of whether they make passing grades. It is called social promotion. While this practice may be politically correct, it has, I believe, become the single most important factor leading to the decline in quality of public education in America. Under our amendment, in order to receive Federal funds, States would be required to prohibit the practice of social promotion and adopt achievement standards in the core academic subjects. Decisions about how to implement a nonsocial promotions policy would be left to the States and localities. Implicit in the amendment is that remedial education is necessary and can be provided through a number of different Federal, State, and local sources. This amendment is carefully written so that implementation is left with State and local governments. For example, State and local officials would decide all specifics of promotion policy and the criteria for passing and holding back students, achievement standards, subjects that constitute the core curriculum, grades when students would be tested, grading methods, testing methods, and remedial education. The amendment defines social promotion as a formal or informal practice of promoting a student from the grade for which the determination is made to promote or not to promote to the next grade when the student fails to achieve a minimum level of achievement and proficiency in the core curriculum for the grade for which the determination is made. The amendment covers elementary through secondary grades--grades 1 through 12. It is carefully crafted so that reform changes could be made incrementally, grade by grade, or in any fashion the State or local school districts see fit. Social promotion misleads our students, their parents, and the public. Even educators have concluded that it doesn't work. Let me give you the conclusion of a study conducted by the American Federation of Teachers. I quote: The American Federation of Teachers has said that social promotion is rampant and that only 22 States have standards in the four core disciplines of English, math, social studies, and science that are well grounded in content and that are clear and specific enough to be used. They surveyed 85 of the Nation's 820 largest school districts in 32 States representing one-third of the Nation's public school enrollment. None of the districts in the AFT national survey has an explicit policy of social promotion. But almost every district has an implicit practice. According to the U.S. Department of Education, a third of students across the United States perform below the basic level of proficiency; 15 percent who graduate from high school cannot balance a checkbook or write a letter to a credit card company to explain an error on a bill. Mike Wright, a San Diegan, told the San Diego Tribune he continued to get promoted from grade to grade and even graduated from high school even though he failed subjects. At the age of 29, he enrolled in a community college to learn to read. Let me talk for a moment about social promotion in Los Angeles. School officials decided they would end the practice. That is the good news. The bad news was that if it were done all at once, they found that one-half of the entire student population --350 students-- would have to be held back. More than two-thirds of eighth graders would be flunked if social promotion were fully ended. The problem was so massive that they have had to scale back their plans and implement the new policy more slowly. They have taken a multistep, phased-in plan, and this legislation is structured to give school officials the flexibility to do just that. I would like to read a letter sent to me yesterday from the superintendent of that school district, a man who was superintendent of public instruction when I was mayor of San Francisco and whom I respect greatly. He points out: The Governor of California, Gov. Gray Davis, has endorsed our amendment. In a February 29 letter to me he wrote: Mr. President, at least half of my State's 5.6 million students perform below their grade level. California ranks 36th out of 39 States in fourth grade reading proficiency, 32nd out of 36 States in eighth grade reading proficiency, 41st out of 43 States in fourth grade math performance. Let me speak about Chicago, the major city of the Presiding Officer. On June 1, I took a group of top-level California educators and experts to Chicago and spent the day discussing what was being done. In Chicago, they have abolished social promotion. They have established content standards. They test student performance in meeting the standards. They have adopted a core curriculum, teacher lesson plans. They evaluate schools on a regular cycle. They intervene with failing schools. They have performance criteria for teachers and principals and they put in place extensive remedial and afterschool programs providing the very necessary help for struggling students. The Chicago school district is 90 percent minority and 90 percent poverty. If it can be done in Chicago, it can be done everywhere else. The results are there: Reading, up 12 percent; math, up 14 percent. Scores are improving. Chicago stands as an example, but it takes political will and courage to make these changes. Our legislation provides the incentive. I yield 10 minutes to my cosponsor, the distinguished Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions.","word.count":147,"sep11":-2.61516853932584,"years":1999.24438202247,"days":1511,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0269698009483112,"Topic 2":0.494329649049242,"Topic 3":0.0672456206440202,"Topic 4":0.0308905917403537,"Topic 5":0.0563748572612746,"Topic 6":0.00897995384938094,"Topic 7":0.0128397455569902,"Topic 8":0.179243816011666,"Topic 9":0.11090438149992,"Topic 10":0.0122215834388406},{"id":"10720010077709","body":"Michael Enzi: These are States that see the special emphasis in the bill and want to add their congratulations and hope for approval of the conference report. We are always encouraged that those who have that direct of a hand in education are showing support for work we have done. H.R. 1 strikes a good balance between making sure that Federal funds are well spent and maintaining appropriate State and local control of education. It significantly changes accountability standards with the goal of assuring that low-income and minority students, as well as other students, are learning. Yet it also prohibits national testing or Federal control over curriculum. While States will be required to administer the National Assessment of Educational Progress, known by the acronym NAEP, every other year in grades 4 and 8, there will be no rewards or sanctions associated with the results. The use of NAEP will simply be a tool for parents to evaluate the performance of their child's school against others in the Nation. Of course, we will also provide accountability for NAEP and we will watch to see if they can get the results out faster than in previous experience--as when I was in the Wyoming Legislature. It will give a measure, a comparison, for parents to rely on and to give them some direction with what their children are learning compared to the rest of the Nation. Some of the most important provisions in this bill concern our Nation's teachers. As we know, one of the greatest educational resources is our teachers. I say this not only because my daughter is a teacher but because research has found, with the exception of involved parents, no other factor affects a child's academic achievement more than having knowledgeable, skillful teachers. Every member knows that. Every Member knows teachers who have had a tremendous influence on lives, ones who challenged us or encouraged us or disciplined us. Right now, there are Hallmark ads on behalf of teachers, in a very special way conveying a message of thanks, something we need to do to teachers in the past who have influenced our lives and made a difference. By the time we are in the Senate, a lot of the teachers are to longer around to be able to get that thanks. It is an opportunity we should not pass up. There is a Hallmark ad I particularly like where the teacher is retiring, packing up his books. A lady comes to visit, a former student. She is surprised that he does recognize her and even remembers a paper she wrote. He says: I suppose you went on to be one of those corporate, well-paid lawyers. She says: No, I became a teacher, like you. We need to be thankful we have people who are willing to teach children, educate children, and spend the time with kids, to know them well enough, to help them understand what learning is. We have those kinds of dedicated teachers in the United States. This bill will help to ensure there continue to be those kinds of teachers. There were several places where contentious negotiations took place during the deliberations on this conference report, but one area that was not negotiable was ensuring our children have high-quality teachers, especially when it comes to reading and math. H.R. 1 contains unprecedented reforms that will help to ensure that all children are taught by a highly qualified teacher. Unlike more restrictive proposals that require States and local school districts to use Federal funds exclusively for the purpose of hiring new teachers, this legislation provides maximum flexibility to States. It will allow them to develop high-quality professional development programs, provide incentives to retain quality teachers, fund innovative teacher programs such as teacher testing, merit-based teacher performance systems, alternate routes of certification, or to hire additional teachers, if that is what they believe is necessary. Despite all of these efforts to improve teacher quality, there are some who say all we really need to do to improve student achievement is to hire more teachers. For small, rural States such as Wyoming, that is not the answer. While I certainly recognize our Nation is facing a teacher shortage in the coming years, Wyoming currently has a declining student enrollment, which is forcing some school districts to eliminate teaching positions. Moneys specifically earmarked for hiring new teachers will be of little help to schools in these areas with declining enrollment. In addition, rural States such as Wyoming often have difficulty recruiting and retaining teachers--especially highly qualified teachers. We do have quite a bit of success, once we get them to come to Wyoming, at retaining them. Of course, we recognize anybody who can make a living in Wyoming usually lives in Wyoming. We do appreciate those teachers who come and stay. In this bill, money earmarked for new teachers does not help Wyoming keep teachers from leaving. Congress must provide State and local school districts with flexibility to pay good teachers more money or provide other incentives in order to encourage them to continue teaching. It is because of issues such as these that I am particularly pleased this legislation paid special thanks to rural school districts. H.R. 1 provides rural districts with increased flexibility in funding to enhance academic achievement while helping to ensure that students in rural areas have equal access to educational opportunities. As many folks from Wyoming are aware, rural schools often receive too little money from Federal categorical formula grants to provide meaningful services to their students. By the time the formula is broken down for the size of the school, there is not enough money to do the program. In addition, they generally do not have personnel or resources necessary to secure Federal competitive grants which many schools use to augment and innovate beyond what is provided for in formula grant programs. The Rural Education Achievement Program, also known in this bill as rural flex, is included and addresses these problems by permitting rural schools to combine funding from a number of different formula grants. This allows rural schools to better serve their students by allowing them flexibility to determine where their money can do the most good. Eligible school districts can use funds for virtually any activity authorized under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, including educational technology, professional development, technical assistance, and teacher recruitment and retention. The conference report also makes it clear that rural districts often face unique challenges in implementing restructuring actions that result from 5 consecutive years of failure, and they should be given flexibility as long they are held to the same accountability requirements as other districts. Distance does create challenges. In Wyoming, we have miles and miles of miles and miles. We have a population of 493,000 people, and our State has 400 miles on a side. The average town that I visit is about 250 people. It is a long way between those towns. For virtually every town, you can drive outside of it and you see the whole town at once. It is not one running into another, running into another, running into another. Even Cheyenne, WY, our largest city of a little over 52,000, can be seen in its entirety by driving outside the town and looking back at it, and it is a long way to be able to see the next town. In fact, usually you cannot see a next town. What happens if you give people flexibility with schools, if they can go to the public school of their choice but is too far to go to another school? We already have public choice in public schools. Usually our schools are not failing, so this provision would not pertain to those schools anyway. But this bill will allow those rural schools that have failed to make progress but may not have the resources necessary to hire a completely new staff of teachers or find a private contractor willing to take over the school's governance, to take advantage of additional options as long as they are equally rigorous and are likely to help the school improve its performance. Under the same provision, the Secretary of Education will be required to assist rural districts that request assistance in implementing alternative governance arrangements. I thank Senators Collins, Murray, and Bingaman for their hard work on this particular language. I am also pleased the conferees were willing to recognize that schools in rural areas and small towns often require additional assistance to implement an advanced technology curriculum. Due to the isolated nature of many small rural towns, technology can offer rural students academic opportunities that they otherwise would not have. Ensuring that rural students are technologically literate is vitally important to many communities in my State of Wyoming. I am pleased the conferees have demonstrated their commitment to improve academic performance in rural areas and have helped rural students participate in the highly competitive economy of the 21st century. Wyoming has been a pioneer in distance learning. We now have the capability, in many schools--no matter how small or how rural--to have classes the kids can take through a distance learning program to give them a wider variety of choice of classes. This bill will help to enhance that. This bill also preserves the integrity of Federal educational programs that impact Native American children. As a Senator from the State of Wyoming, which was the crossroads for many of the Indian tribes and is now the home of the Shoshone and the Arapahos, I believe it is critically important that the United States continue to fulfill the Federal Government's unique and continuing trust relationship with, and responsibility to, American Indian people for the education of Indian children. I am confident that the action of this conference committee has helped to ensure the programs that serve Indian children are of the hi","word.count":2024,"sep11":0.27247191011236,"years":2002.13202247191,"days":2539,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.132905784368352,"Topic 2":0.234504060770065,"Topic 3":0.00276384856705558,"Topic 4":0.00424462974391187,"Topic 5":0.138972767568048,"Topic 6":0.00122760734942274,"Topic 7":0.00092962420175429,"Topic 8":0.00963830288258097,"Topic 9":0.00224630985471142,"Topic 10":0.472567064694098},{"id":"10620000017676","body":"John Porter: Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from Wisconsin and everyone on his side of the aisle have stayed very much all the time that we debated this bill on their political point, which they have made over and over and over again. They do not like tax cuts for the wealthy; and if we would only not have put those in the bill, we could do all kinds of things that they would like to do with the money. Let me say something that I know that they will not like to hear, but I personally do not believe that we should every hear in this Chamber the kind of language that divides us. It is wealthy against working people, over and over and over again in their vernacular; and I do not believe that is what this country stands for or what we believe in. It is not a crime to work hard and become a wealthy person. In fact, I would say that universally Americans accept the principle that they value the opportunity to do exactly that. That is what they want to do. And I think this divisive language of setting class against class and saying over and over again that it is one group against another is really not what we ought to be engaged in in debate here, ever. We ought to talk about the principles that we believe in, and the policies that advance those policies. I do not think we believe in class warfare, and I do not think we believe in dividing people by economic means. We do believe, and I agree with the gentleman, that there are people in this country that are really put to the test as to whether they can afford the drugs that they need even to stay alive, and very clearly there are people that are having to make very difficult decisions in their lives in order to pay for those drugs that they should not have to make. We ought to have a program to address the needs of those people. We ought not to have a program to provide universal coverage for prescription drugs, because there are lots of people in this country, about two-thirds of the people, the seniors in this country, that have a prescription drug benefit already under their own policies. They can afford it, they do not need the help. But there are certainly people that do. I believe that this Congress will provide that kind of prescription drug benefit. We will make certain that we are taking care of those people who are put to that tough test and are deeply in need, and we ought to.

Snowe: Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment that has been introduced by Senator Dorgan with whom I have joined as a cosponsor regarding drug importation. First of all, I commend Senator Dorgan for his longstanding leadership and advocacy on this issue which has been for the better part of a decade. Regretfully, we are still at a point where we have been unable to pass legislation that would create a drug safety regime for drug importation. That is the purpose of our amendment, Members of the Senate, as we today consider legislation to address an essential new function in how the FDA will finance the cost of reviewing new drugs; that is, the critical process of bringing new medications to market to Americans. At the same time, this bill has directly raised a number of issues in how we assure that drugs are as safe as they should be, how we can bring new low-cost generic biologics to market. Key to this debate on this legislation that is pending before the Senate is the adage, which we have heard time and time again, that is: A drug which is not affordable is neither safe nor effective. The simple fact is, even with the new Part D prescription drug benefit as part of the Medicare Program that has been in place for more than 2 years now, we still have at least 60 million Americans overall that today pay the full price of medications, have no help whatsoever because many have no health insurance or their insurance does not provide coverage for prescription drugs. At the same time, the price that Americans are paying is the highest price in the world. For those of us who are fortunate to have prescription drug coverage, the estimated cost of medications is part of the major exorbitant increase in the cost of health care. Many of my colleagues have recognized that our system lacks competition that would assure our constituents more affordable access to lifesaving medications. That is why I am very pleased to join with the Senator from North Dakota, and we have the support of a bipartisan group of colleagues in the Senate, along with Senators Grassley and Kennedy and Senators McCain and Stabenow who are unified with us in supporting this bipartisan approach. Today, our voices echo those of 8 out of 10 Americans who are calling for safe importation. After nearly 3 years of awaiting Senate consideration of our legislation in 11 related hearings on this subject in the Senate, we simply must move forward. The reason is abundantly clear. We know the cost of health care is rapidly rising in America. Prescription drug prices have contributed to that exorbitant increase. Compared to 1990, nearly twice as much of our health care dollar goes to medications. As the GAO has readily told us, the cost of prescription drugs commonly used by seniors has consistently increased at two to three times the rate of inflation, as indicated by this chart, when you are comparing brand drugs, generics, and the CPI. That is why we can no longer afford to postpone any action. We have acted before. We acted on legislation back in 2000. Then we also took action with respect to the Medicare Modernization Act in 2003 which created a Part D prescription drug program. We have found the requirements for the Secretary of Health and Human Services to certify the safety and savings of drug importation have blocked any action; it has become a roadblock to safe importation. While FDA was unable to point to a single individual harmed by Canadian drugs--and in Europe, where they have had a track record of more than 30 years of parallel trading--it has proven that this trade can be conducted safely. Time and time again, they have demonstrated that their process of parallel trading has worked without any harm to their consumers. Without a doubt, Americans would not be turning to imports if there was not substantial savings. Indeed, the CBO has told us that countries from which we would import under this bill would pay 35 to 55 percent less for a brand prescription drug. Let me repeat that--35 to 55 percent less than we pay today. In other words, American consumers are paying 35 to 55 percent more than foreign consumers when it comes to medications. That is remarkable. We have seen so many objections to this legislation for the better part of a decade. That is why we have taken it upon ourselves to develop a regime that has been incorporated in this amendment and in our legislation that would address every facet, every issue that is associated with safety in order to allow drug importation to occur. As I said earlier, the European Union has already engaged in parallel trading for three decades without incident. As seen here on this chart, where we have incorporated 31 different key safety provisions in our legislation, and compare that to the Medicare Modernization Act that passed in 2003 that created the Part D prescription drug benefit to the Medicare Program, only 6 provisions that related to safety were incorporated in that landmark initiative. We include 31 different initiatives to address every single safety- related issue that has emerged in this debate. Whether it has been on the floor of the Senate, whether it has been in the course of hearings or elsewhere, we have addressed every safety-related issue to create a regime that should create the assurance that this can be done safely and without harm to Americans so they can benefit from lower priced medications. Americans deserve to have the lower priced medications. The FDA can conduct this program. They can conduct this regime. They should work proactively to assure these drugs are safe. We give them the means and the wherewithal and the resources in order to accomplish this. We comprehensively address the various concerns that have been raised months and years about drug importation so we can get something done. People say: Well, let's just certify safety. Well, as I have said earlier, it is a roadblock. It is an impediment to get anything done. It essentially becomes the poison pill. We have tried certification. We have given the Secretary of Health and Human Services under two administrations--this administration and the previous administration-- the ability to do that, to certify it. They are unwilling to do so because they have said they do not have the resources, they do not have the means. Well, we are giving them the means and the resources. But to pass another amendment that simply calls for the Secretary of Health and Human Services to certify drug importation is a roadblock. It is a road to nowhere with respect to this initiative. That is why Senator Dorgan and I took a different route. We address all the safety questions. We do not certify to ensure safety, we take action with these provisions. What we do is employ the measures to actually make drug importation safe. Opponents claim importation will cause harm. But they fail to note that the greatest threat to the safety of Americans is the inability to take a drug as it is prescribed. That exacts a toll on thousands, if not millions, of Americans each and every year, not to mention lives lost. Some say Americans would receive drugs from illegitimate sources, but under our legislation, Americans will receive imported drugs from 32 countries with high standards. In most cases Americans will purchase an imported prescription drug from their local pharmacies just as they do today. The pharmacies will receive these drugs from the U.S. wholesalers which import them. These wholesalers will have been registered. They will be inspected. They will be monitored by the FDA. This higher level of safety is also a first step in establishing a higher standard for handling of prescription drugs right here in the United States where we have had the preponderance of problems. Our legislation allows individuals to directly order medications using an FDA-registered and approved Canadian pharmacy. Again, just as with wholesalers handling prescription drugs, the FDA will examine, register, and inspect these facilities on a frequent basis. The FDA will assure the highest standards for such functions as making sure the medical history is recorded of the individual, verifying prescriptions, and tracking the shipments. Some say consumers will get medications they should not be getting. Regardless of whether one purchases imported drugs from the local pharmacist or uses a Canadian pharmacy, we assure that a legitimate prescription and a qualified pharmacist will be vital ingredients to ensuring safety. In fact, we have many standards incorporated in this legislation in which it would occur. We adopted language that had been introduced by the Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, with respect to Web sites and domestic Internet pharmacies so that we assure that properly licensed pharmacies and pharmacists are behind Web sites that are offering these medications. Some say importation will allow unapproved drugs to enter the United States. Again, on that point, our legislation is abundantly clear. Every drug received will always be FDA-approved. If any difference exists in a foreign drug, even the most minute, our legislation assures FDA will evaluate the product and determine its acceptability. If the drug is not bioequivalent to a U.S. drug, the Secretary may reject approval of that medication. Some say we will import counterfeits. The truth is, today the FDA does not know even the level of domestic counterfeiting where, as I said earlier, the preponderance of the problem exists. It is simply not employing the very anticounterfeiting technologies which our legislation demands in order to ensure that we protect against the threat of counterfeits. The fact is, we employ technologies today like the ones we use now for twenty-dollar bills. We can use the same for prescription drugs. Moreover, this bill supports development of future anticounterfeiting and track-and-trace technologies, very effective methods which we hope will be used to protect all drugs.

Res. 339 and compliment the gentleman from New Jersey for his cosponsorship of this important resolution, for his passionate statement on the floor today, and for his work behind the scenes to get this resolution on the floor today. It was not easy to do. We were running short on time. This is the last week of our session before the Ukrainian parliamentary elections on March 31, and the gentleman from New Jersey worked with dispatch and effectiveness behind the scenes. I am sure that the freedom-loving people of Ukraine are glad that the gentleman did, as well. Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank the gentleman from Illinois of the Committee on International Relations and subcommittee chair, the gentleman from California , for their commitment to move this bill forward. There were several bumps in the road, but cooperation carried the day. We kept the bill in a strong and effective form, and I compliment all on the majority side for bringing this resolution forward. I certainly compliment the gentlewoman from New York , co-chair with the gentleman from Colorado of the Ukrainian Caucus in the House. The gentlewoman from New York is the prime sponsor of this important legislation. We are all here today to promote this legislation, which urges the Government of the Ukraine to ensure a democratic, transparent, and fair parliamentary election on March 31. The resolution also urges the Government of Ukraine to implement basic tools in order to ensure free and fair elections, including a transparency of election procedures, access for international election observers, multiparty representation on election commissions, and equal access to the media for all election candidates. Mr. Speaker, this is the third parliamentary election in the Ukraine since they gained their independence 10 years ago. It is the most critical. This is a big deal in the Ukraine. If they fail to continue to move forward with democratic reforms, if this is not a fair and free election, it will be a major setback to the cause of democracy in Ukraine. It is very appropriate for this government, as friendly as we are with the people and the Government of Ukraine, to urge that the government in Ukraine do everything in its power to ensure the fairness and openness of this election process. Ukraine has come a long way in the last 10 years. Its economy grew more than 6 percent last year. It has voluntarily given up the third largest nuclear arsenal in the world, and has consistently sought to eliminate its existing stockpile of strategic missiles. There are basic political reforms under way in the country, and we have friendly relations with the Ukraine and we want those relations to continue to be as friendly and supportive as possible. But significant challenges remain. The gentleman from New Jersey and others have indicated the challenges that we have. There are restrictions on basic democratic freedoms in the country. The nuclear plants I mentioned are in desperate need of appropriate clean up. The media suffers from blatant government harassment and pressure, and government corruption runs rampant. There have been a number of activities and accusations involving the government that are terribly disturbing. The gentleman from New Jersey has talked about the unsolved murder of the brave journalist Heorhiy Gongadze in September 2000, and the gentleman from New Jersey and I participated in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe held last July in Paris in which the OSCE awarded a prize to the widow of Mr. Gongadze in honor of his great service and the sacrifice he made in support of freedom of the press. I, as does the gentleman from New Jersey , remember well the passionate speech that Mrs. Gongadze made in Paris a year ago. I am happy to tell the gentleman from New Jersey that Mrs. Gongadze visited my district this past weekend and spoke again with great passion at the Ukrainian Educational and Cultural Center of Greater Philadelphia on a panel called to discuss the importance of the Ukrainian elections identified as ``Ukraine at a Crossroads''; and her passion for democratic reforms remains unabated, as is her desire, as is ours, to determine and hold accountable those that murdered her husband. The OSCE, through their Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, has issued a final report on Ukraine's most recent national election, the presidential election of 1999, and indicates that that election was marred by violations of Ukrainian election law and failed to meet a number of OSCE election commitments. There was state interference with the campaign and government pressure on the media. This month's election has been reviewed ahead of time. There is a group called the Committee of Voters of Ukraine, the leading Ukrainian watchdog group on elections; and they have reported numerous violations in the run-up to the 2002 parliamentary election. So the challenge is still present. This is a very important watershed election in Ukraine. They have got to get this right. They cannot slip back and repeat the mistakes of the 1999 presidential election. They must continue to move forward; and it is very appropriate for this Congress, this House, to urge the Government of Ukraine to run as fair and open an election as possible. Mr. Speaker, Ukraine strives to realize a more robust democracy, and it needs our encouragement and support. It has both, and I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.","word.count":941,"sep11":0.530898876404494,"years":2002.3904494382,"days":2631,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0440239390341777,"Topic 2":0.00944640005018896,"Topic 3":0.00332251695050802,"Topic 4":0.00416816655417036,"Topic 5":0.00210864420434997,"Topic 6":0.0195735327928801,"Topic 7":0.00463795391249054,"Topic 8":0.209535300584695,"Topic 9":0.644250926021543,"Topic 10":0.0589326198949962},{"id":"10620000079263","body":"Max Baucus: I appreciate your concern about flooding in the Saint Frances River Basin and your frustration with efforts to address this situation. Many communities across the nation simply do not have the financial ability to provide the cost share for Corps studies and projects. Because of this, Congress added an ``Ability to Pay'' provision to the Water Resources Development Act in 1986. This provision, which establishes procedures for reducing the non-federal share of water resource development project costs for distressed communities, has been amended several times subsequently. These procedures, which are set by the Corps through regulation, take into consideration local economic and financial conditions. This year, the administration's Water Resources Development Act legislative proposal contained an update to the Ability to Pay provision which included expanding its applicability to feasibility studies and additional project types. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee further expanded the project types eligible and this amendment to the Ability to Pay provision is contained in the Conference Report.

As I indicated, I offer this amendment with my colleagues, Senator Burns of Montana and Senator Conrad of North Dakota. This amendment deals with a provision we put in the farm bill having the rural utility services create a broadband loan program. During consideration of the farm bill, which we enacted in the Congress, we provided a very important provision that will provide for loans for the build-out of broadband capability throughout rural areas of our country. The build-out was part of $100 million in direct spending to subsidize $3.5 billion of loan funds at good interest rates that would entice those who are interested in building out the infrastructure of broadband capability to rural areas to begin doing so. Now, why is that important? It is important because if someone is on the wrong side of the digital divide and they do not have broadband capability in rural areas, their opportunity for economic development is gone. So we have been trying to find ways to help develop the build- out of the infrastructure for broadband capability in all areas of the country, especially and including rural areas. The $100 million in that bill was going to provide an opportunity for $3.5 billion in broadband loans over the 6 years, as I indicated. The Rural Utility Service announced they were going to combine $40 million in the farm bill for the first 2 years and package that up. They said they would make $1.4 billion in loans available for broadband buildout. As a result of that, they would provide not only loans but $80 million in loan guarantees, and so they would have $1.295 billion of loans at the Treasury rate of interest. This is easily the biggest broadband loan program in the history of this country. Why is it important? Let me give an example, going back to the 1930s. In the 1930s, very few farms and rural areas were wired for electricity, so we created the Rural Electrification Act, the REA Program, and began stringing lines to the rural reaches of America. That program was remarkably successful in providing to small towns and family farms in this country the capability of using electricity to enhance their productivity. When we electrified rural America, we dramatically increased the productivity of America's family farms. We now are in a circumstance where we talk about the information revolution and the new technology and information and something called broadband. Broadband simply describes the diameter of the pipes through which information flows. If you have dial-up connections, you have a computer, and you know there is a certain timeframe moving around your computer and moving around the Internet. If you have broadband or advanced communications services, it is a bigger pipe and you can move vast amounts of data very quickly. The opportunity to do that is critically important to small areas, rural areas of the country in order for them to attract economic opportunity and economic development. Without it, they are consigned to a future without that kind of economic opportunity. That is why we are trying to provide it here, just as we did in the underlying 1996 act which I helped write. We talked about advanced services then, comparable services at comparable rates. You have broadband in most big cities now. The question is, will rural areas have the same opportunities? What happened was RUS put this money together and they were going to put out nearly $1.3 billion of loans at 4.9 percent. Again, easily the most significant program of building out information infrastructure. What happened was they set a July 31 deadline for applications. They received applications for $1 billion in loans. That means there are people out there very anxious to move this capability out to rural areas. That is a big deal. This is not just some theoretical argument. This is talking about whether, in the rural reaches of America, you will have economic opportunity and jobs and growth again. We have $1 billion in loan applications. Now the language that has been included in the Agriculture appropriations bill essentially eliminates the broadband section of the farm bill. It will put some money into loans, yes, but does so without the mandatory spending for it and would essentially cut in half the loan levels. That is particularly bothersome because what is going to happen is they are going to have to start over down at USDA with a much smaller amount of money and much less impact on broadband capability. The proposal I offer with my colleagues would provide an additional $6 million. This does not make us whole, but instead of going from $20 million down to $9 million, roughly we go back up to $15 million. It is not the full money we need, but it would increase the $9.1 million to $15.1 million. This is not a massive amount of money, given the bill we are talking about. It just is not. But it is very important for us to pass this amendment because otherwise we will have had a significant start, with great promise, and will have brought this to a grinding halt, and we will have the promise of broadband buildout all across rural America only to find out Congress put the brakes on it. That is not something we want to do. I mentioned yesterday, recently when I was in my hometown of 300 people, a small community in northwestern North Dakota, I walked into what used to be my old boyhood home. I asked the folks if I could just stop in and see it. I hadn't been there for many years. The young woman who now lives there with her husband and children said she was happy to show me my old home. I looked around. In her kitchen--I hope she won't mind me saying this--on the shelf she had a piece of equipment. I couldn't recognize it at first, but it had a camera attached to it, and the camera was taking a picture of something on a spool, hanging on a metal spool. It was a bracelet. She said: I am taking a picture of this bracelet. Then I scan it and put it on the Internet, on eBay, because I sell things on eBay. Here is a woman in a very small community in western North Dakota who is a merchant selling products on eBay. It shows that all over this country people have enterprising hopes about what they want to do, what kind of business they want to be engaged in. But if we do not have the capability to build out broadband services to rural areas, we will forever consign them to a dismal economic future. Let me make one final point. That little town I grew up in, Regent, ND, a wonderful community, is part of Headinger County. My home county is larger than the State of Rhode Island. When I left it, there were 5,000 people living there. There are now 2,800 citizens living in Headinger County. The State demographer says in the year 2020 they expect it to be 1,800 people; 5,000 to 1,800 in a county the size of Rhode Island, slightly larger. Those people want opportunity. They want to build and grow. They want some hope for the future. That woman, in that little home selling on eBay, represents that spark of enterprise, that hope that maybe things can be better. Maybe you can build businesses in those rural areas. But you simply cannot do it if you don't move ahead with this program we put in the farm bill. I introduced legislation about 3 years ago. Much of it was put in the farm bill to create these loan funds. I was astounded to learn this appropriations bill effectively emasculates the funding that would have been automatic for the 6-year period, that would have created this aggressive broadband buildout. That is why we have to restore some of this funding. It is important. People say it is a little issue. It is not a little issue to people in my hometown or other hometowns all across this country, living in rural areas, who want to make a living and want to have some hope for the future. That is what this is about. We have already had a pattern and a template for how this works. It is the old REA Program.

Cardin: Mr. President, in just five years, our Nation will observe the bicentennial of a defining moment in our Nation's history-- the war of 1812. Sometimes referred to as America's ``Second War of Independence,'' the War of 1812 played a critical role in shaping our national heritage and identity. To ensure that this anniversary will be commemorated properly and in a timely manner, I am today re-introducing legislation to establish the Star Spangled Banner National Historic Trail and the Star-Spangled Banner and War of 1812 Bicentennial Commission. Joining me in co-sponsoring one or more of these measures are my colleagues Senators Mikulski, Warner, Webb, Levin, and Clinton. I spoke during the 109th Congress about the significance of the War of 1812, its impact on our Nation's history and culture and the rationale for these two measures. I want to highlight some of those principal points today. The United States declared war on Britain in June 1812, after enduring years of naval blockades, trade restrictions with the European continent, and seizure of American ships and sailors in the ongoing war between Britain and France. With only a small army and practically no navy, our young Nation was ill-prepared to face Britain--then the world's preeminent naval power. By the summer of 1814 defeat seemed certain, with the British combined land and sea invasion of the Chesapeake region and the burning of the Capitol, the White House and much of the federal city. But in their attack on Baltimore, the British met stiff resistance. American patriots successfully defended Fort McHenry and the British invasion was repelled. It was during this battle that Francis Scott Key witnessed our flag flying intact, despite the continuous bombardment, and wrote the words which were to become our National Anthem. Today, many historians see the War of 1812 as the definitive end of the American Revolution--a war which preserved and strengthened our democracy, brought America to the international stage, and helped forge our national identity through the symbols of the National Anthem and the Star Spangled Banner. To commemorate the historic events associated with the War of 1812, eight years ago I joined with my predecessor, Senator Paul Sarbanes, in sponsoring legislation directing the National Park Service to conduct a study of the feasibility and desirability of designating the routes used by the British and Americans during the Chesapeake Campaign of the War of 1812 as a National Historic Trail. That study was completed in March 2004 and recommended that the proposed Star Spangled Banner National Historic Trail ``. . . be established by the Congress as a national historic trail with commemorative recreation and driving routes and water trails.'' The study found that the proposed series of land and water trails fully meet the eligibility criteria for designation as a National Historic Trail--they retain historic integrity, are nationally significant, and have significant potential for public recreational use and historic interpretation. The study recommended that the trail be managed through a partnership between the National Park Service, a trail organization and state and local authorities and concluded that the costs of implementing the proposed trail would be minimal. The study also recommended that the Congress''. . . establish a War of 1812 Bicentennial Commission to coordinate the 200th anniversary of the War of 1812.'' The two pieces of legislation I am reintroducing today would implement these two recommendations of the National Park Service. The first measure would authorize the establishment of the Star Spangled Banner National Historic Trail, an approximately 290-mile series of land and water trails tracing the story of the only combined naval and land attack on the United States and the events leading up to the writing of the Star Spangled Banner. Sites along the National Historic Trail would mark some of the most important events of the War of 1812 including battles between the British Navy and the American Chesapeake Flotilla in St. Leonard's Creek in Calvert County; the British landing at Benedict; the Battle of Bladensburg; the burning of the Nation's Capitol, White House and Washington Navy Yard; the British naval feints up the Potomac River to Alexandria and on the upper Chesapeake Bay; the Battle of North Point; and the successful American defense of Fort McHenry on September 14, 1814, which inspired the poem that became our National Anthem. The second measure would authorize the establishment of a ``Star Spangled Banner and War of 1812 Bicentennial Commission'' to plan, coordinate and facilitate programs and other efforts to commemorate the historic events associated with the War of 1812. Made up, in part, by citizens from the thirty states involved in the War, the Commission is tasked with planning, encouraging, developing, executing and coordinating programs to ensure a suitable national observance of the War of 1812. Both these measures were approved by the full Senate during the 109th Congress, but unfortunately were not acted upon by the House Committees of jurisdiction. With the bicentennial of the War of 1812 quickly approaching, it is vital that the Congress move swiftly to approve these measures and enable the proper commemoration of this important period in our nation's history. The legislation will help provide Americans and visitors alike with a better understanding and appreciation of our heritage. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the two measures I am introducing be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the texts of the bills were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: S. 799. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to provide individuals with disabilities and older Americans with equal access to community-based attendant services and supports, and for other purposes, to the Committee on Finance.","word.count":946,"sep11":5.62640449438202,"years":2007.48595505618,"days":4445,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0449376585318144,"Topic 2":0.4935481769086,"Topic 3":0.0630486432136421,"Topic 4":0.0168662429250756,"Topic 5":0.018080987883285,"Topic 6":0.0375994682274317,"Topic 7":0.178493604772558,"Topic 8":0.0231292948609519,"Topic 9":0.117961171719208,"Topic 10":0.00633475095743286},{"id":"10820040046157","body":"Christopher Dodd: Mr. President, very quickly, I thank the chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee for their leadership on this issue. Once again, I am deeply pleased to be joining Senator Snowe. She has worked tirelessly on behalf of children and the issue of childcare during our joint service in the Senate. I also thank Senator Hatch and others. I go back a long way with Senator Hatch. It was almost 15 years ago, in 1990, when we passed the first Childcare and Development Block Grant, CCDBG. In 1996, we consolidated 4 separate childcare programs and included them in the welfare reform package. I have a couple of quick points to make. Federal funds presently have been frozen for 3 years on childcare. The costs are obviously going up. Senator Snowe pointed out we have 400,000 to 450,000 children who will be dropped from child care assistance if this amendment is not included. At least 600,000 children are on waiting lists in the 24 States that keep them. For the remaining States, obviously, there are many eligible children not receiving child care help. The Governors want this. They have been asking for it. They are cutting back themselves. Every State has cut back in one way or another on childcare assistance programs. Seven million children every day go home from school to an empty house, with no kind of afterschool program and care. I don't think any of us want to see that perpetuated. This amendment is paid for by extending Customs user fees which are scheduled to expire. We are not asking anyone to add to the deficit at all. This is an existing program. There is nothing new about it. It was crafted 15 years ago and part of a consolidation of child care programs in 1996, so it is not a new program. The amendment is paid for and it is absolutely critical. The underlying bill says, let's get people off of welfare and to work. We have expanded some of the work requirements here. You must have additional childcare support, or working poor families will slip back into dependency. No Member wants to be part of a solution that would require that to happen with too many families out there making a tremendous effort to stay employed and independent. Senator Snowe and I graciously ask for your continuing support of this very important program. We urge adoption of this amendment.","word.count":404,"sep11":2.61516853932584,"years":2004.47471910112,"days":3373,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0915554262374386,"Topic 2":0.176168581459679,"Topic 3":0.00900304593233558,"Topic 4":0.117335334435562,"Topic 5":0.00801952852435154,"Topic 6":0.00771965826161105,"Topic 7":0.322885673772738,"Topic 8":0.0193969206651539,"Topic 9":0.240774518304028,"Topic 10":0.00714131240710161},{"id":"10620000033874","body":"Tom Davis: Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to rise today to honor our colleague, Owen Pickett of Virginia's 2nd Congressional District. After 29 years of serving the citizens of Virginia Beach and Norfolk, as well as the entire Commonwealth of Virginia, Mr. Pickett has decided to retire from the United States House of Representatives. My colleague, Mr. Pickett, is a member of the Armed Services Committee and is the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Military Research and Development and serves on the Readiness Subcommittee and the MWR Panel. The 2nd Congressional District is heavily dependent on the massive concentration of naval installations, shipbuilders and shipping firms in the Hampton Roads harbor area, which ranks first in export tonnage among the nation's Atlantic ports. The United States Navy Atlantic Fleet berthed in its home port of Norfolk is one of the greatest awe-inspiring sights in America, or anywhere. The aggregation of destructive power in the line of towering gray ships is probably greater than that of any single port in history. Over 100 ships are based here, with some 100,000 sailors and Marines, some $2 billion in annual spending. For these reasons, Congressman Pickett has been an outspoken advocate for a strong, technologically superior military and has been tenacious in supporting military bases in his district. Mr. Pickett, together with Senator John Warner and the late Congressman Herbert H. Bateman, have provided tremendous leadership on behalf of Virginia. Other issues on which he has taken a strong position are the U.S.-flag merchant fleet, private property rights, public education, veterans programs and a balanced Federal budget. Mr. Pickett was born in Hanover County, Virginia, outside Richmond on August 31, 1930 and was the youngest of three children. He attended the public school system and is a graduate of Virginia Tech and the University of Richmond School of Law. He was first elected to the United States Congress in 1986. With old Virginia roots, he was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1971, at the age of 41, where he was known as a fiscal conservative and for his hard work restructuring the state retirement system. By the time Mr. Pickett won the Congressional seat vacated by retiring Republican G. William Whitehurst in 1986, Mr. Pickett had already served as chairman of the state Democratic Party, headed a Democratic presidential campaign in Virginia and served long enough in the state House of Delegates to be a senior member of the Appropriations Committee. In the House, Mr. Pickett showed his political acumen by getting a new seat created for him on the National Security Committee and getting a seat on the old Merchant Marine Committee as well--two crucial spots for any Norfolk congressman. Much of Mr. Pickett's work has been in supporting Hampton Roads military bases and defense contractors, and revitalizing the shipbuilding industry and merchant marine. That work has been successful. Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock has been building three Nimitz-class aircraft carriers in the 1990s, and has effectively ensured that there is no industry monopoly on building nuclear submarines. The Norfolk Navy Shipyard under Mr. Pickett's guidance has survived four rounds of base-closings and calls for privatization. Mr. Speaker, I join with my fellow Virginian colleagues in thanking Congressman Owen Pickett for his service to the Commonwealth and to our nation.","word.count":551,"sep11":-0.966292134831461,"years":2000.89325842697,"days":2098,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0849706232302212,"Topic 2":0.438912114593324,"Topic 3":0.0142742717984308,"Topic 4":0.054766201920365,"Topic 5":0.0303098573638819,"Topic 6":0.00688129735620388,"Topic 7":0.028048452860162,"Topic 8":0.117255775908603,"Topic 9":0.0450701650349354,"Topic 10":0.179511239933873},{"id":"10620000001034","body":"Nick Smith: Mr. Chairman, first, I would thank the gentleman from Wisconsin and the gentleman from Texas , who have done such great service to further the efforts of science and research in this country. I would also compliment the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Basic Research, the gentlewoman from Texas . This legislation I think gives the emphasis needed to move us ahead in information technology, and certainly we should remind ourselves that information technology research has been instrumental in bringing about the information revolution, which some have compared to the industrial revolution in its size and in its scope. This revolution has spawned new businesses, created millions of good high-paying jobs, advanced the sciences, and certainly improved the health and welfare of the citizens of the country and people all over the world. However, as the President's Information Technology Advisory Committee recently noted, the current boom in information technology is based on the basic research in computer science carried out more than 15 years ago. There is an urgent need to replenish the knowledge base. The advisory committee advocated a 5-year initiative to boost basic research funding significantly and help maintain the Nation's lead in this critical area. This bill, H.R. 2086, was designed to carry through on PITAC's recommendations. In testimony before the Subcommittee on Basic Research last year, university researchers and members of the private sector were very supportive. Dr. Lazowska, a professor at the University of Washington and chair of the Computer Research Association, praised this bill, saying that it exemplifies a sound approach to making research policy by responding to clear national needs with recognizable objectives and a well-defined program for meeting those objectives. In addition, Dr. Roberta Katz, president and CEO of the Technology Network, noted favorably that the 5-year authorizations in the bill demonstrate a commitment to a continued strong Federal investment in basic IT research to move information technology ahead. In today's fast-paced science and technology environment, resting on our past successes is not enough if we are going to keep ahead in a world where other countries are dedicated to matching our productivity and taking away our customers. H.R. 2086 will help ensure that America stays at the cutting edge of new information technologies that will stimulate economic growth, improve our lives, and push forward the frontiers of science. I am pleased to have been a cosponsor of this bill, because it is this kind of initiative that is going to help assure a good future for the citizens of the United States.","word.count":422,"sep11":-1.6123595505618,"years":2000.24719101124,"days":1868,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.167259724980542,"Topic 2":0.179257699007348,"Topic 3":0.00945543754823165,"Topic 4":0.51238943147299,"Topic 5":0.00292387392077704,"Topic 6":0.00705090426250414,"Topic 7":0.0790952602893883,"Topic 8":0.0141670471006943,"Topic 9":0.0258151669334469,"Topic 10":0.00258545448407666},{"id":"10619990019529","body":"Ron Paul: The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3859, as amended.

Years ago, the United States Department of Agriculture exempted small producer handler dairy farmers from regulation because they owned and milked their own cows and sold their own products directly to local consumers. Today, some of these unregulated producer handlers collect U.S. Government subsidies and have grown to be among the largest dairy processors in the country with significant market shares. This is an unfair advantage, and this exemption can adversely affect the prices other farmers receive. Consumers also suffer as unregulated producer handlers eliminate competition. This bill eliminates the loophole that allows now large producer handler operations to be unregulated and requires equal application of the law. It still allows family producer handlers to be exempted if their product is less than 3 million pounds per month.

I have supported a number of amendments to it. I believe this bill does achieve a balance between society's interest of people paying their debts and preventing debtors from being permanently ruined. Senator Grassley and Senator Torricelli have made a good-faith effort to strike that balance. I am an original cosponsor of the bill. I supported some reasonable changes that will improve the bill. If those changes are adopted by a majority of the Senate, I intend to support final passage of what I consider to be a very important piece of legislation that will make certain people don't take undue advantage of the bankruptcy laws, especially those who can reasonably be expected to pay at least part of their debts. These individuals are not excused entirely. That is, in essence, what Senator Grassley and Senator Torricelli have attempted to do. I believe they have struck a fair balance and gotten that done. I understand this is the last legislative vehicle heading, hopefully, toward the President's signature. I want to speak about the methamphetamine amendment that has been offered that we will vote on relatively soon. Staff has advised me I should vote for it, that I should not be seen as being weak on fighting the battle against methamphetamines. I have come to the floor and I wish the author of this amendment were on the floor to ask him, why shouldn't I be angry that this amendment has been converted from a good piece of legislation that would provide additional resources, that would give additional resources to our DEA agents to enable law enforcement to fight in Nebraska the battle against methamphetamines? That is what we are trying to do. I have worked with almost every single sheriff, almost every single law enforcement officer--whether chief of police or the head of our highway patrol--trying to win this battle, and we are not winning it. We have the juvenile justice bill tied up in conference; why don't we pass it? Because we can't reach agreement on how to regulate gun ownership. It provides additional resources to win this battle, to enable us to say we are doing all we can to keep our kids safe against a drug that will destroy their lives. What do we have before the Senate? An amendment that has a school voucher proposal in it. I hear from my judges, from my law enforcement officers, that the net effect of the changes in the penalties on crack and powder cocaine, to increase the penalty to the mandatory minimum on powder cocaine, will be we divert more resources from fighting the battle on dealers and high-level drug usage to fighting the battle against those individuals using cocaine occasionally or on a one-time basis. We will be arresting and putting college kids in jail. That is what we will be doing. I am angry we have interfered with a good faith effort. The underlying provisions of this methamphetamine bill I find to be attractive with the urgency of this problem. In Nebraska, we started this 5 or 6 years ago when the problem of methamphetamine first came to light. We devoted more resources as part of the HIDTA--High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area--effort, part of the multiagency effort. Law enforcement people say they are starting to get this under control; they are making more arrests; they are putting people away. The tougher penalties in here I support because we need to have tougher penalties in place. They say they are getting the job done, but all of a sudden we are playing politics with it again. I favor the underlying methamphetamine effort that is in this amendment. But to attach a school voucher proposal to it and additional mandatory minimums that will redirect resources away from the real serious problems in my community is offensive to me personally. Not only will I vote against it, I intend to write a letter to every law enforcement officer in Nebraska and say to them, they also should be angry. We haven't passed the Juvenile Justice Act. We are not providing resources necessary to solve this problem, and we are playing politics, worst of all, trying to seek advantage, trying to put an amendment up that is difficult to vote against. It won't be difficult for me to vote against this amendment. I am sad that is what I have to do because we are playing politics rather than trying to actually provide our law enforcement officers with the resources they need to solve what has become in Nebraska one of my most difficult law enforcement problems to solve.

On behalf of my constituents in El Paso, I extend heartfelt condolences to the Reagan family during this very sad time.","word.count":164,"sep11":1.73595505617978,"years":2003.59550561798,"days":3060,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.966963009736965,"Topic 2":0.011398571430175,"Topic 3":0.00217751763329162,"Topic 4":0.00600446926871167,"Topic 5":0.00232321544268336,"Topic 6":0.0026026837251551,"Topic 7":0.00171729588812144,"Topic 8":0.00395390308830389,"Topic 9":0.00197920375834651,"Topic 10":0.000880130028246426},{"id":"10519980013815","body":"Ciro Rodriguez: Mr. Chairman, let me, first of all, thank the gentleman from South Carolina for giving the opportunity to me to serve on that committee, and also to the gentleman from Missouri for allowing me also to work with him. Let me just share two concerns that I have with the existing bill, and I think they are very important. One of the first ones is the fact, and I was real disappointed that the Committee on Rules did not allow an opportunity for the language that would have struck out the segregation language that exists in the bill. I think we have a real serious problem in that particular bill if we are going to segregate women. We are going in the wrong direction in that area. When we talk about separate but equal, it was not equal for blacks, and I can assure my colleagues that it is not going to be equal for women. There is a need for us and I would ask the leadership to ask the Committee on Rules to reconsider that opportunity. If not, then I would ask the leadership and the conference committee that as they go into the conference with the Senate, that they strike out that language because I think it is very detrimental. When we hear the arguments as it deals with the separate but equal doctrine and what we want to do with women in the military, I think that I hear what I used to recall back in the 1960s, when we talked about co-ed education in our universities and some of the same language, and it is unfortunate that that is the case. I want to also share with my colleagues an additional concern that I have as it deals with cost. I know we have had a great number of individuals come up here and talk about the need for more resources. We also need to look in terms of the language and what it is in there. Number one, I want you to look very specifically as it deals with the C-17 language. That particular language, number one, sets a very negative precedent. Number two, it is extremely costly, and number three, when it comes to readiness, puts us in danger. I want to be able to share a little bit with you when it comes to the President. At this particular time, the language that we have there begins to tell the Department of Defense what should be core and what should not. As you well know, the last time we did the piece of legislation, we indicated that that is the responsibility of the Department of Defense, not the Congress. I think we are setting a very negative precedent. Secondly, as it deals with cost, one of the estimates is $500 million in terms of the cost just by that particular amendment alone in terms of what it is doing, not to mention that if you begin to move the C-17 work from the private sector where it is right now into the depots, we are going to have a situation that it might be up to $1.5- to $2 billion in cost. So I would ask you seriously to look at that language and be able to take that into consideration when you make those decisions. Thirdly, I think we are all concerned about readiness so that if, as we move, and if you look at that language on the C-17, when it comes to the readiness issue, it really sets a situation in which the depots are not ready to deal with that. They have not been working with that. As Members well know, one of the engines is a commercial engine on the commercial flights, and moving them towards that would be extremely costly and, in terms of readiness, is going to cause a situation where it might take a year and a half to 2 to 3 years before we would even be capable, not to mention the cost of $ 1.5- to $2 billion, so that as we talk about cost and our concerns regarding readiness and regarding other options, we also need to look at the existing language that is extremely detrimental. I would ask that you consider those options as we move forward as it deals with the language on the C-17 and again on the previous item that I had talked to you on the segregation of the armed forces and not allowing the women to have equal opportunity. If we expect them to be able to participate, they should be able to practice. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to express concern with a provision in the Defense Authorization bill regarding the maintenance of the C-17 cargo aircraft. The provision added in committee will significantly increase the costs of maintaining the C-17 by potentially billions of dollars. This increased cost will likely reduce the procurement of future C-17 aircraft, decrease Air Force readiness and airlift capability, and force the Air Force to hire more acquisition personnel. The C-17 is essential for our nation's sustained global power projection and the future backbone of our expeditionary force. Specifically, the bill preempts the Secretary of Defense's authority to determine what systems of the C-17 must be maintained in-house, abrogating the depot provisions adopted in last years defense bill. The C-17 provision structures weapons systems support without regard to Air Force readiness requirements; hobbles partnerships and competition essential for maximizing limited budgets, and delays defense acquisition reforms. For years Congress called on the Department of Defense to implement acquisition reform. The C-17 program is a prime example of the Department's acquisition reform advances in significantly reducing the life cycle costs of new aircraft. However, this bills restrictive C-17 provision will reverse those advances. In addition, last years authorization bill attempted to reduce the Department of Defense's acquisition workforce, or ``professional shoppers,'' by 25,000. However, this bill would require the Air Force to hire hundreds more of professional shoppers rather than streamlining the bureaucracy. Other fiscally irresponsible aspects of the C-17 provision discourage public-private partnerships that would save taxpayers millions of dollars while maintaining a high mission-capable rate for the C-17. The bill forces the Air Force to waste more than $500 million to create in- house maintenance capabilities before an intelligent decision can be made on this new weapon system. In addition, the engine on the C-17 is a commercial engine developed for the Boeing 757. To create an in-house capability for the engine, which the authorization would, would cost the Air Force between $1 billion and $2 billion for the purchase of propriety data alone. In today's constrained defense budget, we cannot expect the Department of Defense to come up with billions of additional dollars to maintain the C-17 in an antiquated manner that doesn't capitalize on the strengths of both the public and private sector and advances in manufacturing. The C-17 was efficiently designed to be maintained on the flight line to reduce maintenance costs. The billions of dollars the C-17 provision would likely decrease procurement of future C-17 aircraft. This is totally unacceptable. In closing, Congress should not preempt the warfighter on the decision of maintenance of the C-17, the C-17 provision will force the Air Force to spend billions on the tail instead of the essential tooth, and the measure will have a detrimental impact on readiness.","word.count":1232,"sep11":-3.40168539325843,"years":1998.45786516854,"days":1231,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.560398247770593,"Topic 2":0.0207778596217101,"Topic 3":0.0431061366534882,"Topic 4":0.157496317777202,"Topic 5":0.0262694746660931,"Topic 6":0.0541319314263789,"Topic 7":0.0175994167166234,"Topic 8":0.036481393515444,"Topic 9":0.039537463931722,"Topic 10":0.044201757920745},{"id":"10419950043310","body":"Non-Voting Delegate: Mr. President, I rise to follow my friend, the Senator from Minnesota, in noting what I thought was useful, and that was the tour of freshman Senators throughout the country, actually, starting here in Washington, on through the Midwest, and ending up in Cheyenne, WY. It seemed to me to be a very useful kind of an activity. Our theme was ``Promises Made, Promises Kept.'' I think it was appropriate that 9 of the 11 new freshmen in this body participated. We made 10 stops in 9 States to talk about this kind of commitment to the things that had brought us to the Senate in 1994. I think we all agreed in general that there was a message in 1994, and that message basically was the Federal Government is too big and costs too much and we need to change the regulatory restrictions on the opportunities in this country. That has been the effort of this freshman class, and to a large extent this body during that year. We have felt some kinship in that we have come here together, we did share this commitment, and we were committed to change. We had just come from an election where, I think, that message perhaps permeates a bit more than those who have been here before, perhaps. There has been a great deal of success, I think, in that message. We have not accomplished specifically all the things that we would like to but the major change has been the turn of the debate. I think most anyone who has watched the Congress over the last 25 years would have to say that the conversation has basically been centered around those programs that have been in place for 25 years. They largely came in the Lyndon Johnson Great Society time, and each year most of the time has been spent saying, ``How much more money do we put into the program? If it has not worked as well as it should, we will put more money in.'' Now that debate has changed somewhat. The debate has change markedly. We are talking for the first time in 25 years about a balanced budget. We are talking for the first time in 25 years about how you spend less rather than more. That is a significant change in the framing of the debate in this country, a significant change in the direction that this Congress would take, and hopefully that this country would take. We have talked about things like reducing spending as opposed to continuing to add more to the deficit, to add more to a $5 trillion debt. We talked about a balanced budget. We have not had a balanced budget in almost 30 years. This is the first time that a balanced budget has been presented to the President of the United States. Unfortunately, he saw fit to veto it. We have talked about entitlement changes. Most anybody who looks at our financial situation fairly has to see that we have to do something about entitlements. You cannot change the direction of spending by simply talking about those things that are discretionary. Two-thirds of the spending is in entitlements. You have to change that. Of course it is difficult. But we have set about to do that. We have talked about welfare reform, to make welfare the kind of program that most everyone believes it ought to be, where you help people who need help, but help them get back into the system, back into the workplace. Middle-income tax reform--instead of the largest tax increase in the history, which is what we had 2 years ago, we are talking about middle- income tax relief. Also line-item veto, term limits, regulatory reform. That is what has happened. We are very pleased about that and we took that message to the country. In addition to that message, I think we took some facts. We sort of evolved into politics by posturing and to a situation of policy by perception rather than facts. It is ironic. We have the ability to present facts to the whole world in a second. Fifty years ago it was months after something was done here before people even knew about it. Now we have this great opportunity, but unfortunately we are doing governing by advertising, doing governing by spinning. We talk about gutting Medicare. Nobody in this place is interested in gutting Medicare. In fact, when you look of course at the numbers, why, obviously, it is not. That is what we talked about. We talked about fundamental change. We heard a great deal of positive response to that. People who are aware of the benefits that come from balancing the budget, the fact that we can lower interest rates, reduce the cost of mortgages, and reduce the cost of loans to send your kids to school, and we can talk about being responsible for going into a new century without continuing to add costs to the debt for our kids to pay. I want to say that I think this trip was very useful and I am pleased that my colleagues were willing to take their time to go. I am particularly pleased they went to Cheyenne, WY. We had the largest town meeting we have ever had there. Not everyone is in agreement how to do it, but the preponderance of people say we need to be responsible. We need to look to the future. One little guy in the audience had a computer. We talked about $5 trillion debt, he divided it by the number of people and announced we each owe $17,000, and we were dazzled a little by the technology, but the answer is right, we do. Mr. President, what we need here is leadership. We need to provide for the direction of this country. We do not need obstructionism. We do not need insistence on the status quo. This is a great country with a great future. We have the best opportunity that we have ever had to strengthen that future and make it a land of responsibility and the land of opportunity.","word.count":619,"sep11":-6.28932584269663,"years":1995.5702247191,"days":203,"party":"Other","chamber":"","Topic 1":0.162042651571863,"Topic 2":0.0868856939048273,"Topic 3":0.0135991534625764,"Topic 4":0.0124737398916177,"Topic 5":0.0977546491647965,"Topic 6":0.00713164491050715,"Topic 7":0.00824287001270108,"Topic 8":0.151800814950586,"Topic 9":0.0392439520635087,"Topic 10":0.420824830067016},{"id":"10419960075499","body":"Carol Moseley-Braun: Mr. President, on balance, I support S. 1936. It is not a perfect bill, but it is a reasonable bill, and I do not believe that the United States can afford further, indefinite delays. The decision before the Senate is, in part, about the suitability of Yucca Mountain, the risks associated with the transportation of spent nuclear fuel, and the legacy of spent nuclear fuel created by our nuclear industry. The issues that flow from a decision to open an interim facility near Yucca Mountain, however, are as important as the site decision itself. My own State of Illinois, with 13 reactors, has more nuclear plants than any other State. For 36 years, waste has been building up, and the volume continues to grow. With our excellent network of highways and railways, Illinois also faces issues associated with interstate shipments of spent fuel destined for a permanent repository. There will never be a perfect disposal site for spent nuclear fuel. The fuel is dangerously radioactive, and remains so for hundreds of thousands of years. Whether it is placed in deep geologic storage, sunk beneath the ocean, drilled far into the earth, or shot it into space, every approach poses risks to humans and the environment, and none will ever completely eliminate the dangers of this substance. Without a perfect solution, however, we are forced to choose the next best option: A location where the waste will have the least potential adverse impact on human health. Ideally, such a site is in an unpopulated area, away from threats to underground water, away from animal habitats, and in a place where it poses the least environmental risk and where we are assured of maximum security protection. Illinois, home to over 11 million people, is not such a site. Yet, over 5,000 tons of spent fuel are housed at temporary locations scattered throughout my State. Most of these locations are in northern Illinois, near great concentrations of people. The fuel rods are stored in underwater pools, a method never meant to be permanent. While the pools pose no imminent risk, and will likely remain safe for the foreseeable future, they do not ensure complete safety, maximum security, or long-term protection of the environment. And the volume of waste at these sites will continue to accumulate as spent fuel is removed from nuclear plants. For Illinois, there are no perfect answers, there are only options, and each option has its problems. If a Western waste disposal site is opened, Illinois, because of its key role in our national transportation system, faces a future of literally thousands of shipments of nuclear waste across the State. The other alternative is even less palatable--keeping large amounts of deadly waste at Illinois nuclear power plans for perhaps 100 years and beyond, in facilities never designed for long-term safety and security, located too close to people, too close to groundwater, and quite frankly, too close for comfort. My conclusion is that spent nuclear fuel cannot remain in Illinois. Illinois is not suitable for the medium and long-term storage of nuclear waste, and should not have to risk inadvertently becoming a de facto permanent site because Congress fails to act. Congress has debated this issue for 14 years. Illinois ratepayers have paid more than $1.5 billion to help finance the construction of a permanent disposal site in Yucca Mountain. Despite the billions received, the Federal Government has made little progress, and Yucca Mountain is not expected to open until 2010 or later. Meanwhile, space runs out in Illinois beginning in 2001. If Congress fails to act, utilities will be required to build additional storage space at reactor sites, and ratepayers will foot the bill, essentially paying twice for the storage of this waste. I am concerned about transportation. While I have been assured by the city of Chicago and the Illinois Department of Nuclear Safety, both of which have excellent hazardous waste transportation programs, that spent fuel shipments pose no risk to the general public, we must remain as vigilant as possible on this issue. These fuel shipments must be handled in a manner that meets the highest safety standards and does not put Illinoisans or other Americans at risk. That's why I offered an amendment to this bill that would hold the Department of Energy and the Department of Transportation accountable for these shipments, and directs the Department of Energy to select routes that avoid heavily populated areas and environmentally sensitive areas. I thank the chairman and ranking member of the committee for accepting these amendments. I do believe, however, that more should be done to further improve transportation safety, and I hope Congress will revisit this issue in the very near future. It is worth remembering that if this bill is enacted this year, there will be no immediate cross-country exodus of spent fuel. The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board recognizes that ``even if passed into law now, none of the proposals before Congress would enable the operations of a centralized facility before 2002.'' Additionally, the process of licensing and developing a large interim facility, and the transportation infrastrucutre that goes with it, has been estimated to take 5 to 7 years. Furthermore, it is not expected that the Department of Energy will meet several deadlines in this bill. Even if S. 1936 is promptly enacted, spent fuel will remain where it is for quite some time. Each decade of delay, however, adds 20,000 metric tons to storage capacity. Beyond 2020, nearly 85,000 metric tons of spent fuel will have been generated. And that is exactly why the Nuclear Waste Techical Review Board recommends that action must begin now on a Federal facility, so that full scale operations can begin by 2010 when reactors begin shutting down in large numbers. Mr. President, this debate is not about whether nuclear power should ever have been pursued as an energy option. That has long since been decided. We cannot wave the magic wand, nor turn back the clock. Nuclear power is here, and nuclear waste must be dealt with. Our decision on dealing with nuclear waste will never be perfect, because it cannot be perfect. But, it is a decision that must be made. If we fail to act, Congress will send a message to the American people that the nuclear waste problems created by our generation are best resolved, and best financed, by our children and our grandchildren. That is neither right, nor fair, and that is why I am voting in favor of S 1936. I urge my colleagues to do likewise.","word.count":1094,"sep11":-5.24719101123596,"years":1996.61235955056,"days":574,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0376694207886786,"Topic 2":0.326742496599496,"Topic 3":0.00933089551330017,"Topic 4":0.010414867459843,"Topic 5":0.0870795308786313,"Topic 6":0.00807764681429814,"Topic 7":0.00592841586032019,"Topic 8":0.22217968006844,"Topic 9":0.18251314140779,"Topic 10":0.110063904609203},{"id":"10619990012040","body":"Bob Schaffer: Mr. Speaker, I mean it is ridiculous.

It is most fitting and I know that I have watched, as have Americans across the country, as we see the stories of Ronald Reagan and his life and his contributions to this country, stories coming from not only those of us standing on the Senate floor but from other countries, from small communities. People are focusing on the man that was Ronald Reagan, a great leader for this country. The stories that have been told have been wide-ranging, covering President Reagan's role in the cold war, his truly undying sense of optimism for the country, the discussions about Reaganomics, and, of course, all those personal stories that make President Reagan so unforgettable. Alaska certainly has its stories to add and to share as well. President Reagan's impact on Alaska began before he even entered the office of the Presidency. In 1980, the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, putting over 100 million acres of land under Federal control, was pending before the Congress. With Reagan's election that year, leaders in the House and Senate--at the time, both were under Democratic control--knew that if they were going to get a bill signed into law, it would have to be then, before President Reagan was sworn in, and the Act, for better or for worse, was signed into law on December 2, 1980. But President Reagan understood Alaska and Alaskans. In his book, entitled ``Reagan, In His Own Hand,'' the President asked this very important question: He tried to ease the impact these land withdrawals had on Alaskans living in and around the new parks and refuges. He fought for access to these lands to provide for economic development, and it was his administration that determined that oil drilling should be allowed in a small section of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a debate that continues today. Alaskans remembered all that President Reagan did for us in both Presidential elections by giving him wide and broad-based support throughout the State. President Reagan had the opportunity to visit Alaska several times. He liked to talk about his ties to the State. He was a big fan of Robert Service, and one of his favorites was a poem entitled ``The Shooting of Dan McGrew.'' It is a poem about a particular barroom brawl, and most people may remember the beginning of it: It is a wonderful, kind of down-and-dirty, rough-and-tumble poem that personified what many wanted to believe about Alaska and the last Frontier. But President Reagan was quite fond of that. I had an opportunity last night to pull out ``The Shooting Of Dan McGrew'' and read it yet one more time, and it brought good smiles to my face. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the full contents of ``The Shooting Of Dan McGrew.''

It is estimated that there are a million displaced people in Colombia and that 100,000 a year leave Colombia because of fear for their lives over what these narcotraffickers and drug cartels have done to this country. We often worry about political difficulties here. We get negative letters or nasty phone calls, and we think we are putting up with a lot. In Colombia, if you take on the drug cartels, you and your family risk your lives. Journalists, judges, police officials, if they have the courage to stand up to these people, put their lives in jeopardy. This drug cartel would not exist but for the fact that Americans consume the products grown in this country. I think we bear responsibility to work with a courageous government and a courageous people who are paying a terrible price because of our habits and our consumption. For those reasons, I am disappointed we can't find the time to bring up this supplemental bill, deal with this issue, and offer help to the people of Colombia and to the government of Andres Pastrana, who has shown remarkable courage. This President was kidnapped by these very people. He is not just intellectually committed to this; he knows what it is like to be terrorized by these people. He is committed to doing everything he can. He can ask us for our help, but we cannot seem to find the time to bring up this issue. When people wonder why we are not dealing more effectively with the drug problems of this country, you can point to this. We spend days discussing insignificant issues, in my view, by comparison to this. Yet we are told by leadership we don't have time to bring up an issue. At least debate it, and vote it down, if you want, but give us a chance to vote on whether or not we think providing $1.3 billion over the next several years to the people of Colombia to fight back is worthy of this institution's time. I think it is. The President has asked for it. The House of Representatives, to their credit, has done so. Yet this body refuses to bring up this matter, even to discuss it on the floor of the Senate. The legacy in Colombia is a legacy that President Pastrana confronted when he assumed office in 1988. He inherited the reins of government. Since then, he has demonstrated, in my view, leadership and a firm commitment to address the myriad of challenges facing his nation--drug products and trafficking, civil conflict and economic recession. I have enormous respect for the manner in which President Pastrana has so quickly and aggressively taken steps to entice Colombia's largest guerrilla organization--the so-called FARC --to come to the negotiating table following on the heels of his election to office. The agenda for those ongoing talks covers the waterfront of economic and social issues that must be addressed if four decades of civil conflict are to be brought to a close. President Pastrana has evidenced similar courage and a vision in tackling Colombia's illicit coca and poppy cultivation and processing industry. He authorized the extradition of a number of Colombia's most notorious drug traffickers to the United States, an extremely controversial decision in his country. He has also crafted a national plan--the so-called Plan Colombia--to address these intertwined problems in a comprehensive fashion. President Pastrana has made it clear to us that the Government of Colombia is prepared to do its part in making available its own resources--billions of dollars--to fund the various elements of that plan for alternative development programs, for protection of human rights, for working for the resettlement of displaced persons, and for judicial reform, as well as assistance and training for Colombia's military police, the counternarcotics forces. During our meeting yesterday, President Pastrana made it clear as well that he needs to seek and intends to ask for international cooperation if his plan is to succeed. In fact, he left last evening for London to meet with members of the European Community and has already received favorable indication that the Pacific rim will be a part of this international effort. Colombia is currently the world's leading supplier of cocaine and one of the major sources of heroin. We are the largest consumer of these products. But this isn't only President Pastrana's problem; it is obviously ours as well. All of the enormous demands in the United States and Europe for illicit products grown in Colombia are clearly an important part of the equation in keeping drug traffickers in business. Moreover, despite billions of dollars spent here at home on law enforcement and drug education designed to reduce the U.S. demand, illicit drugs and consumption continue to pose a threat to the safety of our streets and to the health of the next generation of adults. I know earlier today my good friend and colleague from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg, spoke about the fact that he is concerned that not enough money is being spent on domestic-related programs and programs to protect our borders against the onslaught of foreign drugs. If one looks at the full picture of our counternarcotics efforts, only a modest amount is currently being spent on the supply and reduction of the source. Assuming Colombia's supplemental is approved, only slightly more than 15 percent of the total counternarcotics budget is being spent on programs off our shores where the products are grown: $2.9 billion out of a total of $18.5 billion is what the Colombian program has adopted, which would be roughly half of what is being spent overseas; $1.3 billion is being requested. A little more than $1 billion right now is being spent off our shores. More than $2 billion currently is being spent on border programs alone in this fiscal year. If we do nothing to stem the supply at the very source, where it comes from, then I don't see how a border program alone can prevent the exploding supply of drugs from reaching America's streets and communities--rural and urban. I am all for adding more money to programs--as the Senator from New Hampshire talked about--in the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Coast Guard. But I think we are kidding ourselves when we believe border programs alone will shut out illegal drugs. We need to attack this problem also at its source. There is not one place where this battle is going to be won. We need to do everything we can to make our borders more secure. We need to make sure our police departments have the tools necessary at the local level. We need training programs and rehabilitation programs to get people permanently off these substances. But we also need to attack the problem at its source. That also is part of the answer. It is also why it makes sense for Congress, in my view, to act expeditiously on President Clinton's and President Pastrana's request to us, so we can attack the drug problem as vigorously as possible at all these sources but particularly in Colombia. It is in our interest to provide Colombian authorities the wherewithal to gain access to areas in southern Colombia and elsewhere where coca and poppy cultivation has exploded in recent years but where guerrilla organizations and right-wing paramilitary units have made interdiction efforts extremely difficult to conduct safely. President Clinton has decided that Plan Colombia is worthy of U.S. support. The House leadership has also decided that it is in our national interest to do so. Fifty-two thousand Americans are dying every year in drug-related deaths. That is almost as many as died in the entire Vietnam conflict. Every year, we lose that many in drug-related deaths. If that is not a U.S. interest to which to try to respond, I don't know what is. As much as we need to fight this at home, we also need to fight it at its source. There is clearly bipartisan support for this program. It is not perfect. It is not a program I would even necessarily write, nor maybe the Presiding Officer, nor would my colleague from California, whom I see on the floor. But let's not fly-speck and nickel-and-dime this issue. Let's at least get it to the floor, debate it, discuss it, amend it, and modify it. But don't deny us a chance to even vote on this issue as we now enter another recess this year. For another 10 days, we will not be here. The House is out, I am told, maybe another week after that. Then it is May, June, and July. How many more deaths will there be on our streets? How many more Colombians have to die because of U.S. consumption and addiction? They have a democratic government, the oldest democracy in Latin America, whose very sovereignty is at stake. This country is being ripped apart. They are asking for our help, for the cooperation of Europe and other nations to fight back against these people and this multibillion-dollar operation. We don't even have the time to debate or discuss it. I promise you that over this Easter break, there will be a lot of speeches given about the problems of drugs in our streets and our narcotics efforts. Yet another day will go by when we cast one vote here, or two votes here--maybe--and no effort is made to bring this matter to the attention of the American public and to debate it on the floor of the Senate. Despite this bipartisan support, the measure is currently stalled. In the Senate, the majority leader suggested the clock has run out on an emergency supplemental. That has not been the history or experience of the Senate. We have dealt with many supplementals after April. I hope maybe we can do so in this case as well. We asked President Clinton during our meeting for his assessment of the likelihood that Plan Colombia will work in the absence of U.S. assistance being forthcoming in the near future. We also asked about the prospects for other governments contributing resources to this effort in the absence of U.S. moneys being forthcoming. President Clinton stressed unequivocally ","word.count":1919,"sep11":-1.44943820224719,"years":2000.41011235955,"days":1926,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.20336222345263,"Topic 2":0.178823739274423,"Topic 3":0.0227367527813973,"Topic 4":0.399998084645583,"Topic 5":0.0313978710736987,"Topic 6":0.0107381944399858,"Topic 7":0.0161454823468996,"Topic 8":0.0488583177424585,"Topic 9":0.0702725053447193,"Topic 10":0.0176668288982043},{"id":"10920050078103","body":"Tom Coburn: Mr. President, I will spend a few minutes talking about the Commerce-Justice-State-Science appropriations bill and about my reasons for voting against it when it comes up today.

As I indicated during a Special Order organized last week by the gentleman from Connecticut, Mr. Larson, I believe the war in Iraq is the centerpiece of the administration's failed foreign policies. The war in Iraq has proven to be a diversion from what should be our primary foreign policy focus, winning the global war on terror. Our preoccupation with Iraq is decimating our Armed Forces, who now find themselves entrenched in a civil war where they do not belong. The administration's failure to measure progress in Iraq is matched by its broader foreign policy failures. North Korea and Iran present greater risks to our safety and security than they did when the President identified them as the ``axis of evil'' in his 2002 State of the Union address. Today, the situation in Iraq is a tragedy, for America, for our brave troops in uniform, for the future of our Nation, and for the prospect of Middle East peace which fades every day we stay in Iraq and as the violence between Israel and Hezbollah continues. Although 2006 was supposed to be a ``year of significant transition'' pursuant to last year's defense authorization law, we are no closer to finishing the year with any measure of positive transition than we were when the year started. I call my colleagues' attention to a new book by Thomas Ricks, the Washington Post reporter who appeared on Meet the Press on Sunday, to discuss ``Fiasco: The American Military Adventure in Iraq.'' As Mr. Ricks explained, the administration's foresight and planning was as poor as its conduct of the post-war period. It is why, 3\\1/2\\ years later, we are is still paying the price for such negligence, and why 2006 is not on track to be the year of significant transition that not only had we hoped for, but that we simply must have. Halfway through the year, these statistics show that we are moving backwards, away from our goal of handing Iraq over to a safe, secure and stable democracy. There were 3,149 civilians deaths in the month of June. That is up from 1,978 civilian deaths in January. For the year, more than 14,000 Iraqi civilians have died. That is an average of 2,400 a month. Another way of looking at that is every 5 weeks, Iraqi civilians die in the number that we lost on September 11. The overwhelming majority of deaths have occurred in and around Baghdad. If the Iraqi police and army can't provide security, is it any wonder that the Iraqi people have turned to the militias? That is not a measure of progress in any year, but particularly in a year of transition, that would be a turn for the worse. Every day focusing on combating sectarian violence is another day and another dollar we divert from what should be our priorities, increasing oil production, rebuilding infrastructure, promoting more dialogue between Sunnis and Shia and developing a long-term political solution for a stable, lasting democracy. The Iraqi leadership isn't showing much progress either, particularly following remarks by Prime Minister al-Malaki and Speaker al- Mashhadani, who both openly condemned Israel in recent weeks. Combined with the fact that nearly 50 percent of Iraqis support attacking our troops, Iraq is no closer to what the neo-conservatives envisioned as a partner for Israel who would catalyze change and bring about stability in the Middle East. When the prime minister addresses a joint session of Congress tomorrow morning, I would hope he says the following: First and foremost, that Iraq is indebted to America for the sacrifice of 2,500 of its sons and daughters. Second, that he regrets and retracts his comments about Israel. Third, that he is committed to routing terrorists, sectarian violence and corruption and disarming the sectarian militias. Fourth, that his government will honor the rights of ethnic and minority constituencies by revisiting divisive sections of Iraq's constitution. Still, Mr. Speaker, it will take much more to accomplish the long- term political goals necessary to restore stability, liberty and democracy, not only in Iraq, but to a region suffering under the strain of so much violence and uncertainty. But we have a long way to go. Reaching our objectives will be further down that path as a result of the administration's failure in the pre-invasion planning and the conduct of the post-war period. The tragedy of Iraq is perhaps the most solemn and vivid reminder of why a change in leadership is long overdue, and why America deserves a new direction in its foreign policy.","word.count":710,"sep11":3.9747191011236,"years":2005.83426966292,"days":3857,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.696521299130837,"Topic 2":0.175280195645635,"Topic 3":0.044644757645734,"Topic 4":0.0240434487330534,"Topic 5":0.0129985017485854,"Topic 6":0.00570328229509538,"Topic 7":0.00522129604627139,"Topic 8":0.0111380066967146,"Topic 9":0.0203523818736174,"Topic 10":0.00409683018445648},{"id":"10519980031926","body":"James Moran: Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman, I am going to rise in support of this amendment. The reason is a pretty basic principle. What we are appropriating, Federal money is directed. This is local money. This really is the money that comes from the citizens of the District of Columbia, and it would seem they should be able to spend it as they would like. I admire the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia for wanting to sustain the Advisory Neighborhood Commissions, because she lives in D.C., and it is not always convenient to have these ANCs. For example, the gentlewoman wanted to build a deck, and she had to go before the ANC before she can build a deck because it affects the quality of life of her neighbors. The former Speaker wanted to put in a garage, he wanted to close an alley. He could not do it because he had to go to the Advisory Neighborhood Commission himself. Mr. Michel, the former minority leader, had to go through the same kind of thing. I am sure it is annoying, but the fact is it provides a kind of vigilance to protect these individual neighborhoods. Now, I thought that the gentleman from North Carolina brought up a very important point when he showed the newspaper article, because the newspaper article pointed out that the woman, who happened to be the mayor's former wife, Mrs. Treadwell, but the woman did misappropriate funds. That was a crime. But the point is that an audit caught it and she was punished for it. So the system is working. When we have these egregious instances, the people that commit them are caught, they are brought to justice, and it shows that the people of the District of Columbia are not going to tolerate this kind of thing. I think that is good. I am sure that the ANCs do not work at maximum efficiency nor effectiveness, and we have read articles that show that there are a lot of deficiencies. What the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia suggested is try to fix it; suggest some things that will tighten it up. Already suggestions have been made by Members of the D.C. council, and I understand they are going to be implemented, that will tighten it up, and we could do more than that. But I think to impose our will upon something that thousands of people are involved in, to say no, you cannot do this, you cannot do it with your own money, you have to give up what is really the most directly representative government that the District of Columbia has, is contrary to the principle that I thought the other side stood for, which is the maximum devolution of authority and responsibility down to the lowest level possible, where people can exercise their civic duties and responsibilities, and that is this Advisory Neighborhood Commission structure. I do not want to fall on our sword on this, and some of the things they have done are clearly indefensible. But I think it is more indefensible for us to stand here as judge and jury and to say that the citizens of the District cannot use their own money as they would choose. If this was a direct appropriation I think it would be something different, and I trust that we would not be appropriating directly Federal funds. But that is not what this is. This is really an imposition from the Federal Government in a way that not only is micromanagement, but I think is a real slap in the face to the efforts of the District of Columbia to gain maximum representation for their citizens, and particularly, opportunities for their civic leaders.","word.count":631,"sep11":-3.17977528089888,"years":1998.6797752809,"days":1310,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0220471243935276,"Topic 2":0.193395790766694,"Topic 3":0.608937681478226,"Topic 4":0.00861722697395213,"Topic 5":0.0243504715409833,"Topic 6":0.0289882449016974,"Topic 7":0.00379555154534301,"Topic 8":0.0953649901583261,"Topic 9":0.00757539200865499,"Topic 10":0.00692752623259555},{"id":"10820040011121","body":"Pete Sessions: Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman not only for his articulation of the wonderful merits of fairness in our Tax Code, fairness for all the people in all the States.

Currently, church-sponsored employee benefit plans are exempt from ERISA and therefore are not exempt from state insurance laws like other employer-sponsored plans. Even so, these plans have generally operated as if they were exempt from state law. It is unfair for church plans to be potentially subject to greater regulations than other employer- sponsored plans, and it does not make sense to subject church employee benefit plans to state insurance laws that are not designed or equipped to deal with these unique plans. My home state of Minnesota is one of four states that already provides an exemption for church plans. However, church plans have no legal certainty when they provide benefits in the remaining 46 states. This has caused many insurers to refuse to do business with church plans because these plans could be considered unlicensed entities. Last year, I heard from the Board of Pensions of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, headquartered in Minneapolis, about the need to clarify the status of church benefit plans. I especially appreciated the advice and counsel of Bob Rydland and John Kapanke about this urgent problem affecting more than one million clergy and lay workers across the United States. Because the rules affecting church plans are found in the tax code, I asked Chairman Archer of the Ways and Means Committee, with the support of 13 bipartisan colleagues, to support a legislative correction to this problem. I am pleased this legislation before us today accomplishes our objective. S. 1309 will clarify that church employee benefit plans are not insurance companies under state insurance laws. This bill was crafted with the help of state insurance commissioners, and it does not prevent states from enacting legislation targeted at these plans. I am also grateful to Chairman Boehner and Ranking Member Andrews of the Education and Workforce Subcommittee on Employer-Employee Relations for their work on this important issue. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation to protect the employee benefits of America's church workers.","word.count":358,"sep11":-1.24157303370787,"years":2000.61797752809,"days":2000,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.180215455513439,"Topic 2":0.0102014889756768,"Topic 3":0.395621940558425,"Topic 4":0.332193708664101,"Topic 5":0.00530841059879661,"Topic 6":0.00471107611027465,"Topic 7":0.00673921198295025,"Topic 8":0.0515622299111661,"Topic 9":0.0108906378118665,"Topic 10":0.00255583987330326},{"id":"10820030075862","body":"John Ensign: Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a man of remarkable leadership, dedication, and courage and to join Nevadans and Americans in mourning the loss of retired Air Force General Bill Creech. As chairman of the Military Readiness Subcommittee, I have learned a great deal about what it has taken and what it will continue to take for our armed services to be the top military in the world, bar none. For the strength, effectiveness, and success of today's Air Force, this nation owes a debt of gratitude to Bill Creech. Creech started as a private in the Air Force in 1944, and as he rose 14 rungs to four-star general, he never forgot what it was like to be at the bottom. During almost 40 years of service to this nation, he flew 280 missions as a combat pilot and was decorated 39 times, including 22 awards for bravery in combat. In 1960, he came to Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas where he was director of operations for the ``Top Gun'' Fighter Weapons School and during which his relationship to southern Nevada first formed. In 1978, he earned his fourth star and became commander of the Tactical Air Command, or TAC, at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia. During his 6\\1/2\\ years as commander, Creech showed the Air Force how to get the job done, and his leadership continues to be a lesson to us all. Under his direction, TAC's productivity improved by 80 percent and resulted in $12 billion of savings for the government. And while Creech cut out the fat and waste, he oversaw the development of a new generation of air fighters including many modern jets as well as our prized Stealth fighter that eludes radar detection. Creech also used his experiences in Vietnam to develop night-flying tactics that led to our victories in the Persian Gulf War and Iraq. After his retirement from the military, Creech became an internationally recognized management consultant with a best-selling book on total quality management based on his success restructuring the Air Force. For anyone who manages a single office or a multi-billion dollar corporation, Creech's message is invaluable. By rewarding accomplishments, creating pride in ownership, and developing a team atmosphere, the human factor endures and success results. To southern Nevadans, Bill Creech will always hold a special place in our hearts for his loyalty and dedication to our beloved Thunderbirds, the air demonstration team that calls Nellis Air Force Base home. A Thunderbird pilot who flew 125 demonstration shows, Creech was once referred to as ``the father of the Thunderbirds,'' and he believed that the Thunderbirds inspired young people to join the Air Force. The Thunderbirds exist today because Bill Creech stood up for them. After four pilots were killed in fight, he publicly stated that if the team suffered an accident during his tenure he would resign. We are grateful that he took that stand. I have had the honor of watching the Thunderbirds in action on many occasions. They display the power and awesomeness of our Air Force and the dedication of people like Bill Creech who lift this nation to new heights so that we may all continue to soar. To Bill's wife, Caroline, I offer the condolences and admiration of Nevadans and Americans. This great Nation that Bill Creech risked his life for and lived his life for will always be grateful for his contributions.","word.count":574,"sep11":2.04494382022472,"years":2003.90449438202,"days":3170,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.217510792652565,"Topic 2":0.169649564944894,"Topic 3":0.0142701892915262,"Topic 4":0.0160241908762286,"Topic 5":0.482753369340071,"Topic 6":0.0169931124144986,"Topic 7":0.00989018606045866,"Topic 8":0.0404872161595898,"Topic 9":0.025354965223172,"Topic 10":0.00706641303699584},{"id":"10820040051497","body":"Blanche Lincoln: Mr. President, first I commend my colleagues on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee for all of your hard work on this important piece of legislation and for bringing a bipartisan bill before the full Senate. When the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act, or IDEA, was enacted in 1975 it brought with it the promise that children with disabilities would have access to the same quality education as nondisabled students. Over the last 30 years, IDEA has advanced the inclusion of students with disabilities into general education classrooms and has given nearly 6 million students nationwide access to services that address their special needs. When Congress passed IDEA nearly 30 years ago, they committed to providing states with 40 percent of the funding necessary to implement this law. Much to my dismay, Congress has failed our schools and the students they serve by providing them with a meager 19 percent of the funding as of fiscal year 2004. It was my hope that this current reauthorization would include mandatory full funding for IDEA because I believe that schools have waited long enough for the Federal Government to fulfill the promise made to them so many years ago. I was proud to support an amendment proposed by my colleague from Iowa yesterday, which would have provided mandatory full funding of IDEA. Unfortunately, the amendment failed by a small margin. I supported another amendment, however, offered by my colleague from New Hampshire to provide full discretionary funding for IDEA, which passed the Senate. I am proud that the Senate made full funding for IDEA a priority, and I look forward to working with my colleagues throughout the appropriations process to make full funding a reality. There are several important aspects of this bill, which will improve the educational experience of students, parents, and teachers. I am pleased that this bill will reduce the paperwork burden on teachers. I have heard from many special education teachers in my State of Arkansas that spend an inordinate amount of time on paperwork and this legislation would provide them with welcome relief so that they can focus on student performance. This bill will also streamline discipline procedures, which I believe will make schools safer and provide school administrators with increased flexibility. Additionally, it will improve parental involvement by creating parent and community information centers with the objective of encouraging parents and schools to work together and resolve disputes in a smooth and efficient way. I am also pleased that this bill provides more resources to schools to better train teachers and parents. This provision is of particular importance to Arkansas where school districts are trying to give financial assistance to teachers for continuing education but are struggling because they face tough budget times. I would also like to reinforce that every single child's learning experience is impacted by their community and school environment. Let us not forget that children with disabilities contribute an extraordinary amount to that learning environment. Students with disabilities deserve every opportunity to achieve educational success so that they can take on productive jobs and lead independent lives. IDEA is a critical law in ensuring that these opportunities are available, and I believe the bill before the Senate today will help educators, parents, and students achieve success in the classroom and beyond.","word.count":552,"sep11":2.73876404494382,"years":2004.59831460674,"days":3417,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.896862782831184,"Topic 2":0.0332342865504217,"Topic 3":0.00730202977399449,"Topic 4":0.0170422618318577,"Topic 5":0.00704367316962213,"Topic 6":0.00909019891302076,"Topic 7":0.00560898866756325,"Topic 8":0.0131535010525481,"Topic 9":0.00760843416422795,"Topic 10":0.00305384304556027},{"id":"11020070000409","body":"Paul Ryan: Madam Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership and chairing this important subcommittee and her hard work on this bill, along with Chairman Frank, and I rise in very strong support of the revitalization, reauthorization of an important program, HOPE VI. This legislation will increase the annual authorization from $100 million to $800 million, and it is really a funding housing crisis, affordable housing crisis in our Nation. This funding and this program is desperately needed. In New York City alone, over tens of thousands of people are on the waiting list for public housing. This bill requires that all public housing units proposed for demolition be replaced on a one-for-one basis and that any units demolished will be replaced within 36 months. This is tremendously important because people in public housing have no other place to go. It adds additional tenant protections by requiring public housing agencies to monitor and track all households affected by the HOPE VI revitalization program, as well as develop a relocation plan that provides comparable housing for all relocated residents. In an effort to be better stewards of our environment, this bill requires all replacement housing and other structures part of the HOPE VI development to be built in accordance with flexible green building standards, and it's appropriate for the government to have high environmental standards. It will be more energy efficient in the future and, in the long run, will save taxpayers dollars. This bill continues a really important program that revitalizes severely distressed public housing and transforms them into safe, livable communities. And since its creation, it has provided over 560 grants, and Congress has appropriated over $6.6 billion in funding. It has helped public housing authorities create relationships with the private sector and open up opportunities to bring partnerships that bring in much-needed resources into struggling communities. For example, by 2004, 92 public housing authorities have used $313 million capital funds to leverage over $1 billion in private investment. These funds have been used to modernize and redevelop public housing. With the crisis in safe, affordable housing we are seeing in our country, it is my hope that with our reauthorization of this important legislation we can continue the successes of this program. I really urge my colleagues to support this program that is vitally needed.","word.count":667,"sep11":5.45505617977528,"years":2007.31460674157,"days":4384,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.103596782474924,"Topic 2":0.478733003606455,"Topic 3":0.01846370445132,"Topic 4":0.238487101485969,"Topic 5":0.0555747930008775,"Topic 6":0.00286470871782349,"Topic 7":0.0206513102086521,"Topic 8":0.014751379920893,"Topic 9":0.0516567954456201,"Topic 10":0.0152204206874656},{"id":"11020070005932","body":"Pete Sessions: Mr. Speaker, it's an honor to be before the House once again. As you know, the 30-Something Working Group, we have been coming to the floor now for some 5 years to not only share with the Members but also with the American people on what's happening here in the Capitol. I'm going to do a short segment because we have other Members that need to come to the floor. And the hour is late, and tomorrow we're going to be working pretty hard past this hour tomorrow, I'm pretty sure. And we want to make sure that everyone is able to make it home and do the things that they need to do to prepare for that day. Mr. Speaker, with that, I just would like to say that we've been in debate now for a couple of hours on the budget, the 2009 budget. And I can tell you, Federal budget, as it relates to the House version, I can tell you what I've read and seen of the President's budget, we have a lot of patching up to do in that budget. Tomorrow we will have a number of different caucuses coming to the floor presenting their budget, their ideas. Some of them came before us today to talk about some of those issues to be considered before the full House, and I'm glad that we are providing that opportunity for the Members to participate in that process; also, to be in debate with the Republicans on Democratic new ideas, moving in a new direction. And I think it's so very, very important not only for the Members of the House to be a part of that exercise, but also for the American people to witness that exercise so that they will know, firsthand, who has the best priorities for the working American people that are out there, and those that are retired and those that are yet unborn, preparing this Nation to be able to bring them up in a way and to be able to have the resources in place so that they can see the kind of strong America that I witnessed when I came about. Now, let me just share a little bit about this budget. And it supports fiscal responsibility and also accountability on government. I think a lot of the frustration with so many Americans right now is based upon a lack of accountability, a lack of oversight, a lack of restraint as it relates to spending. And I think when you have accountability, you're going to save money. I don't think it, I know it. Now, 13 years in public service, and 8 years at the State level, I think it's important that we embody that. And this budget, it brings the budget back to balance by 2010, and our House budget, unlike the President's budget that he has proposed, not only to the House, but to the Senate, also the budget follows PAYGO rules which you say pay as you go, something that we adopted in our rules to say if we're going to spend it, we're going to show how we're going to pay for it. And I'm glad to see that we're still embracing not only that rule, but also that philosophy as it relates to the American people, of what they ask for. The administration also continues in the fiscally irresponsible practices. And in this budget we bring it back to being responsible. And it's a real contrast, because since January 2001, a $5.6 trillion, 10-year surplus has been converted into a record deficit. And as you know, Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor almost every night to share how that deficit has crippled America and hasn't allowed us to be able to do the things that we need to do back in our districts. I think we look at the wasteful spending; this administration is littered with examples of wasted spending and lack of accountability. And I'm glad that Chairman Spratt of South Carolina has embraced that in his budget that he's bringing to the floor. Our budget that we're bringing on the Democratic side, we're looking at not only strengthening the economy, but creating jobs and at the same time energy, education, jobs, infrastructure and innovation will be the watchwords as we move through this process as basic principles. And so many Americans can, and also the Members, can go on www.budget.house.gov to look at the Democratic budget because I think it's important that we have that level of transparency so that they can take a look at the proposals that we are going to put forward. So many of my constituents and so many Americans are challenged by the cost of energy. And we do know on January 22 of 2001, gas prices were at $1.47. And now, today it's at $3.13 per gallon. And I know many of my constituents and many of the Americans that are paying attention to the proceedings here on the floor, they're saying, well, Congressman, you're a little bit off of that $3.13, because as I moved around Washington, D.C. today I saw it as a lot greater. We provide, with our budget, as it relates to dealing with some of these gas issues, it provides a $6.1 billion funding for renewable energy and energy efficiency and other energy programs, which is $1.1 billion, 21 percent more than the 2008 level. So we are moving in that direction making those kinds of investments, and some may translate that into saying that we are pulling ourselves out of Iraq, out of the Middle East and investing in the Midwest and trying to not only push private sector but also Americans in the direction of being more energy efficient so that we don't find ourselves continuing to depend on the big oil companies. If I can have my big oil company chart, I would appreciate it, because I think it's important to be able to reflect on it. Also, it rejects President Bush's budget cuts of energy efficiency and renewable energy programs, including the cuts to solar energy power, and also what the President did in terminating the weatherization-assistance program. We are replacing all of that, and I think it's important for Americans to understand what is happening here. These big oil companies have reaped record profits under the Bush administration, and as you can see here in 2002, it was first $30 billion in record-breaking profits. It then kicked over $59 billion, $82 billion, $109 billion, $118 billion and $123.3 billion of these oil companies raking in these profits. And as you know, Mr. Speaker, we have moved legislatively to make sure that we call back some of those giveaways that the Republican Congress gave these oil companies. And this has resulted in what I talked about a little earlier, $1.47 when the Bush administration started in January 22, 2001, and it almost sounds like an inauguration date, and what we face now at $3.13. The barrel of oil continues to go up. So this energy investment and being efficient is very, very important to the country, also very, very important to national security. We also invest in hundreds of billions of dollars in new investment and green jobs, green-collar jobs. These are jobs, Mr. Speaker, that we can't ship overseas. When we make our building greener, when we make our homes greener, these are jobs that anyone who can even be a high school dropout with a skill would be able to participate in to that individual that became an engineer. These are jobs that you just can't send overseas. And this is a real economy and not a credit card economy, not a second mortgage economy, or not an economy where one has to go out and continue to borrow to live. This is real money coming in for real working Americans that are here so that we can put folks to work and get them off the unemployment role. I'm going to end right there, Mr. Speaker, as it relates to the energy investment because there are so many other investments in here as we look at education, transportation, and infrastructure. And today, just today, the Speaker had an infrastructure meeting in the Speaker's office with many individuals that felt that they had a way to not only incentivize an economy but also build on the infrastructure of America. So many of my constituents and so many Americans are very concerned about the investment that's going on in Iraq right now. Crumbling bridges, railways are not what they should be as it relates to moving transportation. We have trains that can move freight almost 430 miles on one gallon of diesel fuel. I mean, these are things that we have to continue to work on to not only save our environment but also create American jobs. And that's what I'm very excited about in this budget that we are putting forward, to give us the guideposts that we need in this country to not only do away with the debt by 2010 but also get the country moving in a direction so that it can be a safer place for our children and grandchildren. With that, Mr. Speaker, we always want in the 30-Somethings to not only hear from the Members but also hear from the American people on various issues that are facing the Congress. Next week we are going to be on Easter break for the next couple of weeks once we finish our business this week, But the 30-Something staff continues to work to come up with the great ideas that we put forth on behalf of the American people. And we are talking about Democrat and Republican, Independent, those that are thinking about voting and those that can't even vote yet. Our e-mail address is 30-SomethingDems@mail.house.gov. Again, 30- SomethingDems@mail.house .gov. Or if you want any of the information that we shared with you tonight about the budget, we know that you can go on www.budget.house.gov. Again, www.budget.house.gov. And any general information that you may want, what Democrats are doing here in Congress, www.speaker.gov, and I think that's easy enough to remember.","word.count":215,"sep11":5.55056179775281,"years":2007.41011235955,"days":4418,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.287393446839708,"Topic 2":0.131151966615291,"Topic 3":0.0393349075257507,"Topic 4":0.0142655012940093,"Topic 5":0.0150643992684111,"Topic 6":0.396213990560088,"Topic 7":0.00813778096843643,"Topic 8":0.0401080313444885,"Topic 9":0.0413797385534998,"Topic 10":0.026950237030316},{"id":"11020080057606","body":"Bill Nelson: Mr. President, the Congressional Record for July 9, 2008, inadvertently omitted my written statement for the Record.

But I don't believe in blanket immunity for the phone companies. That's why, in the Intelligence Committee, I offered language to deny immunity to the telecommunications companies for their alleged participation in the President's warrantless wiretapping program. But that amendment failed--and failed miserably. During floor consideration of the FISA bill, Senator Feinstein and I offered a compromise amendment that would have required the FISA court to review the actions of telecommunication companies who participated in the President's warrantless wiretapping program. But it failed too. Now I am backing an amendment by Senator Bingaman that would at least delay immunity until the inspectors general of the U.S. Government complete their investigation of the President's warrantless wiretapping program. Upon completion of the report, the Senate will have ninety days to act before immunity is granted to the telecommunications companies. This will allow us time to change some minds if real wrongdoing is found. Overall, I believe this legislation significantly improves civil liberties protections for Americans while enabling our intelligence community to listen in on terrorists.

These belts will help prevent deaths in all kinds of underground mines. And the amendment will ensure that mine operators have a chance to use up the perfectly good belts that they have in their inventory. Also, the S-MINER Act will not adopt new safety standards for underground non-coal mines, except for the conveyor belt, and in this case, the mines which regularly emit methane gas, new rules for explosion-proof seals. It certainly does not treat these mines like coal mines. The current air quality standards for underground salt mines are based on 1973 rules established by a private organization and incorporated by reference into the MSHA regulations. It is hard to even locate a copy of these old standards. It is the intent of S-MINER to adopt air standards that are justified by the unbiased scientific evidence as preventing health risks to miners and are feasible for the mines to achieve. If mine operators object to the new mine health limits based upon concerns of technological or economic feasibility, the bill requires them to fully analyze these concerns before adopting new standards. By speeding up the rulemaking process, we want to accelerate MSHA to address real hazards, but do not intend to adopt unsupported standards that do not create significant benefits or are not feasible for compliance. The S-MINER Act does increase minimum and maximum penalties for violation of requirements that specifically protect the health and safety in underground metal and non-metal mines. However, it leaves in place the requirements in the law that small mines get a break, that a mine operator's history is a factor in assessment, and that the degree of negligence and seriousness of the hazard is to be considered.

Enactment of the GI bill in 1944 marked the beginning of Federal efforts to open the door to postsecondary education for individuals who would otherwise be unable to attend. Over the past 50 years, the scope and variety of Federal student aid programs have expanded considerably. Today, any student in need of financial help can obtain it. My reason for addressing the Senate now is to dispel the notion that, somehow, all this will change if Congress enacts student loan changes as part of the budget reconciliation bill. Unfortunately, misconceptions about this legislation are widespread, and I believe it is important to set the record straight. A few weeks ago, the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources reported its portion of this legislation, providing Federal student loan savings of $10.85 billion over 7 years. Because the Federal student loan program is one of the few mandatory spending programs under the jurisdiction of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, it was the only place we had to turn in order to comply with our instruction. Granted, $10.85 billion is a substantial sum over 7 years. However, to hear some describe our package, one would assume that it spells the end of higher education as we know it. Mr. President, that is simply not the case. Federal student loan programs were established to assist students and their parents in financing postsecondary education. These programs have been successful in achieving that goal. Approximately $26 billion in loan funds have been made available this year. The figure will grow next year. Even if the Labor Committee package is approved intact, that volume will grow. The reason is that the savings in this package were achieved without restricting a student's ability to borrow. In short, there is nothing in the package which limits the amount of loan funds available. Loans will continue to be available to all who qualify. There is nothing in the package which limits the ability of a student to qualify for a [[Page S 15298]] Federal loan. The rules are exactly the same as they have been. There is nothing in the package which increases the cost of the loan to a student who is in school. The only direct cost to students included in the package applies to new borrowers after they leave school. At that point, they will continue to be able to defer loan payments for 6 months--the so-called grace period--but the Federal Government will no longer subsidize interest payments during that period of time. That, I believe, Mr. President, is reasonable. This package was developed with the clear intention of minimizing costs to students. I believe that purpose was accomplished. It is, therefore, particularly disturbing to me that students and their families are being intentionally misled about the impact of the proposed changes. I fear that this misinformation will discourage some students from even exploring postsecondary education, and that, I believe, would be a real tragedy. I would like to explain briefly how the $10.85 billion in savings is achieved. First of all, about $4 billion of the savings comes from reductions to entities involved in the guaranteed loan program, such as banks and guaranty agencies. The elimination for new borrowers of the interest subsidy during the 6-month grace period achieves about $2.7 billion in savings over that 7-year period. This change would mean an extra $1.89 a month for an undergraduate who borrows $5,500 in 1 year. At most, it would mean an additional $22.50 a month for a graduate student who has borrowed the $65,000 maximum through his or her college career. Capping the direct loan program at 20 percent of loan volume produces about $1.5 billion in savings. Additional savings are achieved through the elimination of fees paid to schools and alternative originators for direct loan administration. Whatever one may believe about the merits or demerits of direct lending, the fact remains that the way a loan is delivered has absolutely nothing to do with the ability of students to borrow or with the amounts they may borrow. The terms and conditions of direct loans are identical to those of guaranteed loans. There is no difference to the students at that juncture. To suggest that paring back the direct loan program will deprive students of loan funds or make those funds more expensive is plainly inaccurate. The one advantage, at this point, of direct loans and direct lending is that it makes a loan available immediately. It does expedite the process of obtaining a loan by a student. As far as any difference in the loans being more expensive, that is certainly not the case. The package also calls upon postsecondary education institutions to participate in achieving savings by imposing a fee equal to 0.85 percent of the amount of Federal loans made available to their students. This proposal produces about $1.9 billion over 7 years. Some have argued that these costs will be passed directly on to the students rather than being absorbed through the efficiencies in other school operations. Perhaps that will be the case. Even if the entire cost is passed on to the student, it would amount to an average of $20 to $25 per student per year. That is at the high end. Others would be about $11 to $12 to $13 per year. Finally, approximately $700 million in savings is achieved by increasing the interest rate and the interest rate cap on parent loans. When one looks beyond the hype to see the facts, Mr. President, it is clear that this reconciliation package does not spell disaster for secondary education in this country. Blaming a Republican Congress for reducing access to postsecondary education by increasing its costs may be convenient, but it does not explain away the fact that college tuitions have been growing at a rate surpassing inflation for well over a decade. That is what has caused such enormous problems for students and their families, is the escalating cost of college education due to increased tuition. Figures recently released by the college board show an average tuition increase this year of 6 percent, more than double the inflation rate. Average tuition in fees at a 4-year public institution are $2,860. For a 4-year private institution, these costs average $12,432. Mr. President, another 6-percent increase in those amounts next year would mean an additional per-student cost ranging from $171 to $745, presenting far more serious problems for students and their families than anything in this reconciliation package. Federal student aid is simply not going to be able to pick up the slack in such an environment, nor is that a role for which it was intended. That is what I think we need to understand, Mr. President. There is not anything in the reconciliation package regarding student loans that I suppose we would be comfortable with. On the other hand, it is not the tragedy that is being portrayed. I think it is very important that students and their families understand that. No one relishes the task of cutting back. It is much easier to build upon the expensive policies that have brought us to our current budget problems in the first place. However, one can prune the branches without killing the tree. It is a disservice to the American taxpayers to suggest otherwise. Mr. President, I yield the floor.","word.count":1251,"sep11":-6.05056179775281,"years":1995.80898876404,"days":288,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.272776264209035,"Topic 2":0.253448642627766,"Topic 3":0.0259738999646193,"Topic 4":0.0104384988751438,"Topic 5":0.181661152803141,"Topic 6":0.200641947361265,"Topic 7":0.00887724489577046,"Topic 8":0.0290765494162744,"Topic 9":0.0107324359416668,"Topic 10":0.00637336390531707},{"id":"10519970037917","body":"Carolyn Maloney: Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I would like to say how pleased I am, Mr. Speaker, that this legislation gives the House an opportunity once again to confirm its support for the Federal Trade Commission's standard for making a claim that a product is made in the USA. Under this legislation, only those products that meet the FTC's standard are eligible for inclusion on the toll-free registry of products that are made in America. The FTC's standard for making an unqualified ``Made in USA'' claim requires that ``all'' or ``virtually all'' of a product's components be made in the United States and that ``all'' or ``virtually all'' of the labor be American labor. This has been the FTC's standard for more than 50 years. And after a 2-year review, the FTC concluded last year that its standards should not be changed. For the past several decades, consumers in the United States have relied on the ``Made in USA'' label to mean exactly what it says. American consumers want to buy genuine American products made by American workers. The ``Made in USA'' standard educates consumers, ensures truth-in-labeling, promotes U.S. companies, and preserves and creates American jobs. Last year, Mr. Speaker, the FTC proposed weakening the standard to allow products to be labeled ``Made in USA'' when as little as 75 percent of their content and labor originated in the United States. If these proposed regulations had been adopted, the FTC's mandate to fight deceptive practices would instead be used to sanction deception. People all over the country petitioned this Congress and the FTC opposing this new standard. In my district, 9,000 people, by mail, by phone, by petition, said ``no'' to this proposed change. I commend the FTC for its wisdom, ultimately, in returning to the time honored ``Made in USA'' standard. Any weakening of the Commission's standard would only mislead consumers and expose them to the kind of deceptive practices the FTC is supposed to prohibit. The Commission has recognized what many American consumers have known for a long time: Where a product is made is an important factor in making purchasing decisions. And consumers want the ability to support American workers and to invest in the Nation's economic growth through those purchasing decisions. I am happy to support legislation that will help consumers buy products that are ``all'' or ``virtually all'' made in this country. Mr. Speaker, I would note that except for certain technical and conforming changes, this legislation is the same as legislation that has passed the House in each of the last 2 Congresses. Unfortunately, the other body has never taken action on it and the bill has not been enacted. I sincerely hope that will not be the situation this year and that this bill can be enacted into law.

There are real questions that really go beyond this amendment. But the amendment is narrow. It is not complex. Our friend from Florida just gave a long list of what the amendment does not do, and we should not get confused about what the amendment does not do. We should only talk about what the amendment does do. And before I go there, I might say, of course, the amendment does not prohibit the Secretary from doing anything in these two States if the Federal Government, if the Department wins its case. Both the gentleman from Alaska and the gentleman from Michigan have pointed to a letter that the Secretary sent yesterday that said he did not intend to do anything until the case was over. Well, if the amendment is not needed because the goal has already been agreed to, at least by this Secretary and at least for the next 6 months, if the amendment is not needed, surely it does no harm. If the amendment serves no purpose because the goal of the amendment has already been achieved, surely it does no harm to let the authorities in Florida and Alabama know that their cases will proceed. And it also sends a message to the Department of the Interior if this case is not over at the time this Secretary happens to leave, that his desire in this case would continue to be what would determine what the Department can do, that these two States would be allowed to have their day in court, that these serious issues would be fully adjudicated, and that this would be determined before we moved further. The Secretary says that the Department will defer from publishing the procedures in the Federal Register. We have this letter that does say that, and I think it probably is only binding for the Department during the tenure of this Secretary; but again, if it is not necessary, it is certainly not harmful. It would give these States the assurance they need. There are many questions in this area that go well beyond this amendment. But this amendment deals with an important question.

We have here a chance simply to support what has been done by the House in two prior votes and to do so with regard to a matter which was decided in a thoroughly bipartisan fashion with leadership from Members not necessarily in the leadership of both sides but on both sides of the aisle. I would observe that we have a chance here to instruct the conferees again. There is strong need for this because I would note to my colleagues that the leadership on the other side of the aisle has given no comfort whatsoever to those of us who favor this legislation. They have included no strong friends on either the Senate band of conferees or the conferees from the House side on the Republican side of the conference. How much better it would have been had we moved more speedily. How much better would it have been had we considered these matters in a fashion more consistent with the vote which was cast earlier by the House by including Members from the other side of the aisle who were in support of this. If the leadership wants to really demonstrate a measure of bipartisanship, they can show it. They can instruct the parties to the conference to move speedily. They also can construct a pattern of conference members who will give comfort to Members on this side. I, for example, would be much more comfortable if I were to see the distinguished gentleman from Georgia or the distinguished gentleman from Iowa or other Members on the Republican side who worked so hard in such a careful and thoughtful bipartisan fashion and see to it that the conferees in fact fairly represented the will of the House.

The conferees are rigged against us, over-long delay in appointing those conferees and exclusion of the two principal leaders on the Republican side.

With approximately 70,000 Americans currently awaiting organs and more than ten people dying every day, it is clear that our nation is facing a real crisis. This resolution will help both raise awareness and increase donations nationwide--it is a meaningful step toward bringing an end to our nation's current predicament. A Health and Human Services September 1999 Report to Congress noted a growing gap between the supply and demand for organs nationwide. HHS reports that medical technology improvements and a modest increase in donors have not kept pace with the demand for more organs. Demand for organ transplants has increased due to the success of immunosuppression therapies in preventing organ rejection and improving graft and patient survival. The lack of organs available for transplant illustrates the crucial need to focus public attention on increasing organ donation. A number of businesses, foundations, health organizations, and the Department of Health and Human Services have previously designated February 12th as National Donor Day. The first two National Donor days succeeded in raising a total of almost 17,000 units of blood, adding over 2,400 potential donors to the National Marrow Donor Program Registry, and included mass distribution of organ and tissue pledge cards. This concurrent resolution supports National Donor Day, encourages Americans to learn about and openly discuss donation, and calls on the President to issue a proclamation to demonstrate support for organ, tissue, blood and bone marrow donation. Research points to a clear need for public education and incentive programs to increase organ donation. This Congress, I also introduced legislation, H.R. 941, the ``Gift of Life Congressional Medal Act of 1999,'' to provide a commemorative Congressional medal to organ donors and their families to honor their efforts. This Act is intended to draw attention to this lifesaving issue and to spend a clear message that donating one's organs is a selfless act worth the profound respect of our Nation. I hope Members would also consider this effort to increase donations. The problem is clear--there are not enough organs to meet the needs of patients. Let's support initiatives such as H.R. 941, to create an organ donor medal, and H. Con. Res. 247, to honor National Donor Day and to recognize the importance of organ, tissue, bone marrow &amp; blood donation.

I consider it good company that I had both this evening and on that particular scoreboard. I do not know if I thank you, though, for putting me behind J.D. It is always horrible following J.D. J.D., you are a walking encyclopedia on this stuff, and I admire the almost ever- growing list of things that you know about on the whole tax matter. I applaud your efforts there. I would simply say this. I do not want to beat an old horse, and a lot of things have been covered as we have talked about taxes, but I would like to throw in these two cents. That is, we had a town meeting last Saturday, just prior to everybody sending in their tax returns, back home in Charleston, and I tried to think about what is it that you are going to talk about just prior to tax day. I thought about well, May 7 is Tax Freedom Day. I thought about how the average family sends almost 40 percent of what they earned off to the Federal, State, or local government. I thought about how, you know, a hard-working couple works almost until noon to pay for the total cost of Federal, State, and local government. But what occurred to me was why in the world would I be telling them that? Because they know it a whole lot better than I do. In fact, when I have neighborhood office hours, people come up to me saying, Mark, do you realize how much we are paying in taxes? So I did not want to state the redundant, and so I looked. I do not know if you all have heard, Charles Adams wrote a book entitled ``For Good and Evil: The Impact of Taxes on The Course of Civilization.'' So I got out pen and pad and began to work my way through his book. What he does in his book is he looks through the course of civilization, and with each different civilization breaks out tax rates. What was interesting about his study is that if you start, let us say, with the Egyptians, go all the way back to the Egyptians. You go back, let us say, 3,000 B.C., to all the way to when they ended, which I guess was around 476 A.D. And if you look at taxes in their civilization, what you would find is that on average, they had an agricultural production tax of about 20 percent. And then during hard times, this is nothing you would see with the IRS today. But during hard times, they had what they call philanthropa, wherein the pharaoh would say, we had a bad year with crops this year, therefore, there would be no taxes this year. It was rumored that is where the word ``philanthropy'' came from. But roughly around 20 percent. Then you move to the Greeks. Athens and Sparta had this sort of military sharing arrangement there with the other city/states to fight off the Persians, which they did quite successfully. And what was interesting there was they had an indirect tax, a tax ranging anywhere from 2 percent to around 10 percent, 10 percent if it was a shipping channel covered with pirates, 2 percent if it was not. And then around a 10 percent harvest tax for the city/states. They actually had the first progressive tax, which they called liturgy, where it was a voluntary tax for somebody who lived in that city/state who was doing well, they would come and say, we need this help with x. Would you help us? And there was a voluntary tax. But roughly again somewhere on the order of 10 and 15 percent on average. Then in Rome, you break out the republic versus the empire during the first part. During the republic, there was very little in the way of tax because you had a volunteer economy. What you had there is with their army, every citizen who was a landowner volunteered for the army for 1 year. That spirit of volunteerism, if you want to call it that, was so pervasive that even the magistrates volunteered. So as a consequence, there was not a lot in the way of taxes. They had indirect commercial taxes and custom duties, which ranged from on the order of 2 percent to 5 percent. Unfortunately they had slave auctions back then, which were roughly another 2 to 5 percent. But those were the two big taxes. Then as you moved into the empire, taxes began to go up because, first, they had tribunal, which was a war tax. There was a 5-year census. Every 5 years they took a census, and then depending on your wealth, if you were poor, roughly about one-tenth of your wealth was taxed. If you were wealthy, roughly about 1 percent of your wealth was taxes. And that tax went off. And if they were successful in their war effort, there was a rebate with the booty that came with war. They had a couple other taxes, again a 10-percent harvest tax, a 20- percent orchard tax, a 5-percent custom tax. And toward the end of the empire, they actually began to have an inheritance tax of around 5 percent. But again, something just slight of 20 percent on average. If you looked at the Spanish decline, the Spanish empire and how it declined, what you found was they had two main taxes there. The second tax began to get out of whack, if you will. There was a revolt there with Charles V around 1520 as a result of these taxes because they were not viewed as fair. They almost had an arrangement wherein the legislature was promised a whole lot of benefits, pensions, et cetera from the king, which worked fine until the taxes got too high and then there was revolt. The Swiss have long understood the connection between liberty, taxes, and democracy, and for that matter all revenue matters essentially come to vote. An example of that would be, in 1991 a value added tax was proposed in Canada and passed. The same value added tax was proposed in Switzerland and failed, in large measure because they could take that vote straight back to the people. But what struck me about all this, and you could wander through a whole lot of empires and civilizations, was that you can only squeeze so much blood from a turnip. Those numbers happen to fit, in terms of the study of civilizations and taxes there with his book, fit with OMB numbers, and they fit with Reader's Digest, which is an unlikely pairing in my book. Because with OMB they went back and looked at numbers from 1950 to present, and what they found was that regardless of which tax rate you were at, roughly the government share was around 19.8 percent, just shy of 20 percent. Whether you were in the 70-percent tax rate or the 20- percent tax rate, as tax rates ratcheted up and down, you could only squeeze so much blood from a turnip. People responded to that tax. If the tax was up at 70 percent, sure enough, the second earner stopped earning. They stayed home more. If it was down to 20 percent, they went back to work. People responded. So, first, you can only squeeze so much blood from a turnip; and, second, this is where Reader's Digest recently did a poll and went out and asked folks, ``What do you think a fair tax rate would be?'' They asked males, they asked females, they asked whites, blacks, and people earning below $35,000. They asked people earning above $35,000, ``What would be a fair tax rate?'' Resoundingly, in each of those different categories people came back with the answer, around 25 percent. Any yet, as you know, our overall tax burden is closer to 40 percent, which again says to me two things: First, civilizations must have had something right throughout time, and the fact that they were at or below 20 percent on average says to me that we are probably out of whack. And, second, if Reader's Digest gets it right, maybe they could pass along the lesson to us here in Congress, in that here we are bouncing along in the neighborhood of 40 percent. What do their readers say? Around 25 percent would be fair. So I just thought that that was interesting to look at that whole time frame and just say where are we in the grand perspective. Because when I say tax freedom or I say, do you realize you are paying x, people already know that. What was interesting was to look at those numbers and to say, boy, 20 percent seems to be a number that has worked throughout time. I will yield back. I do not want to take too much of your time.","word.count":1504,"sep11":-5.54494382022472,"years":1996.31460674157,"days":468,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0614845071472229,"Topic 2":0.381859544376915,"Topic 3":0.137440555516637,"Topic 4":0.0149881720490234,"Topic 5":0.101405033063418,"Topic 6":0.203559376567099,"Topic 7":0.00361804471423049,"Topic 8":0.0308844335506308,"Topic 9":0.00620689825043936,"Topic 10":0.0585534347643842},{"id":"10820040008288","body":"Ron Kind: Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation, H.R 1779, the Guardsmen and Reservists Financial Relief Act, which will allow members of the National Guard and military Reserve forces to make penalty free withdrawals from retirement accounts if they are called to active duty for an extended period of time. Our National Guard and reserve forces are playing a leading role in our operations abroad. Nationwide, over 325,000 members of the Guard and reserve have been called up to active duty since September 11, 2001. Serving in Iraq and elsewhere, these service members have fought side-by-side with their Active Duty counterparts in often difficult and dangerous conditions. Over the past year, I have had the opportunity to meet with many National Guard and Reserve members and families from Wisconsin who have been called up in support of operations Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq. Members of the 229th Engineer Company out of Prairie du Chien and Platteville, the 829th Engineer Detachment out of Richland Center, and the 652d Engineer Company out of Ellsworth all recently returned from yearlong deployments in Iraq. Their sacrifices, and those of their families, are greatly appreciated by Wisconsin residents. With many Guard and Reserve members taking large pay cuts when called to active duty, it is proper that Congress act to relieve this additional burden. The legislation before us today helps by allowing activated Guard and Reserve members to withdraw money from retirement accounts without penalty. While this legislation assists those Guard and Reserve members and families who need financial assistance to make ends meet, it is only a minor step. I, along with many other members of Congress, support additional tax relief for military families, pay increases for certain personnel, health care improvements, and reenlistment bonuses for members of the Reserve Component. Our military commitments in Iraq and throughout the world are not likely to diminish in the near future, and the Defense Department expects Guard and Reserve units to make up about 40 percent of our total force in Iraq by May 1, 2004. With this in mind, we need to do all we can to support the men and women of the Guard and Reserve who are called to active duty and their families. My thoughts and prayers are with those serving our country overseas, as well as their families. America is firmly behind our troops, and we are all hoping to see them home safe, secure and soon. May God continue to bless the United States of America.","word.count":422,"sep11":2.67696629213483,"years":2004.53651685393,"days":3395,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.836537326016948,"Topic 2":0.0455332294261775,"Topic 3":0.00954376813913288,"Topic 4":0.0220842217495061,"Topic 5":0.00707442512601929,"Topic 6":0.0144273509513028,"Topic 7":0.0120000928101542,"Topic 8":0.016924987910932,"Topic 9":0.0319051981177679,"Topic 10":0.0039693997520598},{"id":"10419950094589","body":"Jay Rockefeller: Mr. President, my distinguished colleague from Washington just made a very, very important point, one which he and I have already made in public at a press conference which we held several hours ago, and that is that we are, in spite of the fact that the Senator from South Carolina, my esteemed, cherished ranking member of the Commerce Committee--who is a very good friend and has been, and his wife and my wife for a long, long time--does not wish to give consent for us to be able to do this--I think with the idea being that if he does not give consent, then the chances that this bill would be less attractive to the White House would increase. Senator Gorton and I are trying to make this more attractive to the Members of the Senate, Members of the House, and the White House. But I have also taken the same blood oath that the Senator from Washington has, and that is that we are so committed in terms of the additur amendment that we will not come back from conference without its being in the proper condition, and that, in fact, if it does not come back from conference in the proper condition, as we said at our press conference, we will vote against a motion for cloture. I do not know how it is possible for any two floor managers to put anything in stronger terms, or to say anything with greater faith and, therefore, it grieves me very much that we will not be granted unanimous consent to do that here when we are being so direct and honest and forthright with our colleagues. There were just timing problems in terms of submitting this, or else the amendment would have been filed and could have been brought up as a matter of the order. Nevertheless, that was not done. The Senator from South Carolina does have the power to grant us unanimous consent, but he chooses not to do so. Mr. President, I also want to simply indulge my colleagues in a couple of thoughts, to make some comments on the discussion here about the section in the compromise now pending. We are there. It deals with punitive damages. No. 1, the whole section is the result of many, many months of negotiation and discussion on, in fact, how a product liability reform bill might best deal with the costs and the problems and the erratic nature which we all recognize is at play--punitive damages. I have tried to represent the Clinton administration's discomfort-- expressed discomfort--with the idea of imposing a flat cap on punitive awards, while accommodating the strong desires of Senators on both sides of the aisle to include some reform in this bill, to pursue the idea that the punishment impleaded in punitive damages should have some sense of connection, in fact, to the crime. I also have to say that in my own personal experience, I do not like to vote for caps. I am on the Finance Committee, and when medical malpractice was before us last year and there was a vote on a cap on noneconomic damages, I voted against it. I do not like caps. It has been my own personal purpose in which I have negotiated in good faith with Members of my own party and the other party to find a way to make sure that the cap would be uncapped. I think we have done that. The Senator from South Carolina knows that. And I say this with respect because he is within his rights and he is a very skilled legislator and a very good friend. I repeat that. He understands that we are, in fact, trying to improve the bill in a way which would appeal to virtually all Members on my side of the aisle, including, in fact, in truth, I believe the Senator from South Carolina himself, because it would be a better amendment with the judge additur provision refined and nobody could dispute that. It would be better than simply two times compensatory damages with an alternate ceiling of $250,000 because one can construe that--although one can never guess what noneconomic damages will be--one can construe that, in theory, to be a cap. So I have been trying my best in negotiating with both sides to try and get that out and have succeeded. I have some sense of accomplishment in that, which is now being put aside by the Senator from South Carolina. Mr. President, I also want to make a correction for the record regarding the discussions of the constitutionality of the judge additur provision in the Gorton-Rockefeller amendment. The judge additur provision in section 107 of our amendment, as it exists now, creates a right to a new trial for defendants if they do not accept the additional punitive awards set by the judge. This provision was inserted to address a perceived constitutionality concern with the judge additur provision--perceived. Senator Gorton and I are now in agreement that this right to a new trial provision is in fact unnecessary to meet any constitutionality test. The Associate Attorney General, in several conversations with my staff, has asserted that he believes the judge additur provision in Senator Gorton's and my amendment is constitutional on its own--free standing--without the provision creating a right to a new trial for the defendant should the defendant object to an award which results from the judge additur provision. Indeed, the Department of Justice prepared a list of precedents and authorities for judicial determinations of the amount of punitive damages which I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Authorities Which Support the Constitutionality of Requiring Judges To","word.count":970,"sep11":-6.50842696629214,"years":1995.35112359551,"days":125,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.213469653026498,"Topic 2":0.0840892329261779,"Topic 3":0.0172412246644176,"Topic 4":0.0154897410277408,"Topic 5":0.116806995457268,"Topic 6":0.0335611015482229,"Topic 7":0.0190576663750331,"Topic 8":0.0319378420229369,"Topic 9":0.461523693177969,"Topic 10":0.00682284977373505},{"id":"10920050073211","body":"Byron Dorgan: I was not aware of the number.

Of course, personally, I am still hopeful we can clear the World Trade Organization legislation. At one time it was cleared in the U.S. Senate. All it does is to give Congress a role in the event there are arbitrary decisions made by faceless, nameless bureaucrats in Geneva where we can exit from the World Trade Organization. It seems to me it is something we would want to do. It is supported by the President, supported by Mickey Kantor, the former U.S. Trade Representative. In fact, it was part of an agreement when I agreed to support it, standing with the President on the White House lawn--the GATT agreement which was part of that agreement. I hope the administration would be helpful. As I understand, all the holds are on the other side of the aisle. I would like to complete action on that before noon today. If it is not possible, it is not possible. Senator Daschle had indicated on Thursday he would be pleased to help. I am certain he will over the next few hours.

It is a challenging process, and they have done an excellent job balancing competing interests within the confines of a balanced budget. I wish to engage in a colloquy with the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee regarding a situation that has arisen in Idaho. The Idaho delegation is concerned over the growing impact a product called OUST has had on crops in fields near the Bureau of Land Management's rangeland treatment areas. The BLM has been using OUST as part of their rehabilitation program to eliminate cheatgrass and stop the fire cycle. The program is two- fold. First spray, then plant native and perineal vegetation which is better feed for cattle and fire suppression. From October 23 to November 3, 2000, in order to control the spread of cheatgrass on their burned land, the Bureau of Land Management sprayed the herbicide, OUST, from a helicopter onto approximately 17,000 acres of their land. This spring, we began to receive reports from farmers that OUST may have spread beyond its intended use area and may be impacting crops in fields adjacent to or near the BLM's treated areas. Sugar beet growers noticed strange growth developments in their crops. As the crop developed, it was determined the lack of growth could be related to the OUST spray. What our farmers project happened is the OUST, which is activated and broken down by water, was sprayed on top of the ashes from the fire. With the lack of snowfall and spring rains, the OUST was blown with the ashes to as far as 10 miles from the sprayed ground. When the farmers turned on their irrigation systems this spring, it activated the OUST and it is now damaging the crops. The most significant damage reported is in the Burley/Paul area and the American Falls/ Aberdeen area in Southern Idaho. Because of all of the uncertainty, BLM has agreed to stop the use of OUST until this issue is resolved. Since the damage was first noticed, testing by the Department of Agriculture in Idaho has indicated the presence of OUST in crops at least 5 miles beyond the BLM's treated areas. Those tests are ongoing and results continue to show the presence of OUST in damaged crops. According to the information we have seen, in some cases the damage to crops in these areas approaches a 100 percent loss. In other cases, crops are only partially impacted, but may still be damaged in terms of their value. In either case, farmers are facing over $100 million in reduced income. The whole extent of the problem will not be known until later because some crop types will not show damage until further in the season. Unfortunately, the projected losses these producers may incur as a result of OUST are only compounded by the ongoing drought, high energy costs, and low crop prices.","word.count":510,"sep11":0.123595505617978,"years":2001.98314606742,"days":2486,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.734428074020796,"Topic 2":0.0330702277038182,"Topic 3":0.0464358867342578,"Topic 4":0.0218058241831635,"Topic 5":0.0258488871333755,"Topic 6":0.0209302034037254,"Topic 7":0.00898599042758055,"Topic 8":0.0913215327099557,"Topic 9":0.00932384680050741,"Topic 10":0.00784952688281984},{"id":"10720020015909","body":"Scott McInnis: Mr. Speaker, I hold deep respect for the gentleman from New Jersey , and I find his comments on some occasions to have substantial merit. But let me tell you, having just heard his comments this evening, that was probably one of the most partisan speeches I have heard on this House floor. The gentleman from New Jersey stands up here and acts as if the Democratic Party takes no contributions and as if taking contributions is some kind of evil. I would be happy to yield time to the gentleman if he would like to come up and explain the trial lawyers in this country, where their proceeds go. It is very easy when you are not charged with getting the mule train up the mountain, it is very easy to sit on sidelines, as the gentleman from New Jersey has done, and criticize the people who have to get that wagon up the mountain. It is always easy when you are not the one having to push or pull the wagon. It is always easy to sit on the wagon and demand more from the mules that are pulling that wagon. I found those remarks almost outrageous, almost outrageous. Outside of the person who spoke them, who has, in my opinion, a great amount of integrity, that is the only thing that saved these remarks that we have just heard from being outrageous. Where was the gentleman from New Jersey when it was time for a bipartisan, not a partisan, effort, but a bipartisan effort to put a prescription care bill together? All we see is after we finally get something done, after finally this House begins to move on prescription care services, we always have the Monday morning quarterbacks that show up, and today happens to be Monday evening, so the Monday evening quarterbacks that show up and say, oh, my gosh, this was not right, you should have done this, you should have done that. But you never saw a shovel in their hands. You never saw them helping to dig the ditch. All they do is sit back there under the shade tree criticizing the people that have to dig the ditch. So I hope that we hold those comments in their proper context, and frankly in the future I would expect more from a gentleman of that capability and that integrity. I want to move on to a couple different subjects this evening that I think are very important. First of all, as many of my colleagues know, I come from the State of Colorado. My district is the Third Congressional District of the State of Colorado, and all the substantial fires in Colorado are in the Third Congressional District and some of the damage by the fire of course has gone beyond the borders of the third district. It certainly has impacted the people of the State of Colorado, and I do not mean to underestimate the damage that these fires caused in their particular areas. But what I want to stress to my colleagues is a very, very small fraction of Colorado actually went into flames and burned down. What is happening, what we are seeing out in Colorado is we are seeing a lot of negative publicity about the damage that these fires did. And again if you owned a home out there that was destroyed by a fire, you could not get much more negative press coverage. Of course it is devastating to you and of course the loss is terrible, but as a State I think we need to put it in its proper proportion because the impact of the negative stories we are seeing about those fires in Colorado, and by the way, all of those fires are pretty well controlled right now. I think all of them but one are contained, but the publicity in the press that we are seeing as a result of those fires is really impacting severely Colorado's tourism economy. So I want to tonight in front of my colleagues bring up this poster here and show the Colorado fire damage. Now, according to what my colleagues have read in the media and so on and the pictures shown across the country, the belief would be that a huge amount of the State of Colorado is in flames. Take a very close look at this. It is the blackened areas of the State of Colorado which have been burned and this is a current poster. We have got some down in Durango. This is the big fire outside of Denver right there, and these other little spots, these little black spots including this spot here in Glenwood Springs, Colorado. Look at that in proportion to the rest of the State. What I am saying is that Colorado is open for business. One can go to Colorado and have a terrific vacation. The mountains of Colorado are still as pristine as they were with the small exceptions of some of these black areas where we have suffered consequences of terrible fire. A couple forests, the Pike National Forest, have shut down temporarily pending more moisture; and we are worried about the fire hazard out there. You will be limited in that you cannot open a can of beans and cook them over an open fire out there in those Colorado mountains. You can use a Coleman stove or something else, but you cannot have open fires. But aside from that, Colorado is open for business. Colorado has four national parks. They are open for business. The Air Force Academy is open for business. My good friend Bob Zimmerman and his crew down there in the valley with the sand dunes, soon to be a national park, the Sand Dunes National Park, soon to be funded this week we hope in an appropriations bill, which will be good news to Bob Zimmerman, they are open for business down there. Go see the sand dunes. There is the Black Canyon National Park, open for business. The Colorado National Monument in Grand Junction, open for business. The Aspen Music Festival, open for business. The Steamboat community, and they have a great summer up there, open for business. Denver, the Denver Rockies, open for business. By far, less than a fraction, less than a fraction of the land in the State of Colorado, was burned, well less than 1 percent. But if you want to help the people of Colorado who have suffered as a result of these fires, go ahead with your planned vacation. Nothing is worse than having a negative impact upon you as a result of fire, and then turning around and losing your job because tourists have quit coming to Colorado. Colorado is open for business. It is a great place to visit. I would urge my colleagues to head for Colorado, if you get an opportunity, or talk to some of your constituents. Encourage them to go ahead and visit our great State. Colorado is the highest place on the continent; the highest place on the continent. The low point in Colorado is higher than almost all of the high points in most of the other States. I think we probably have, I am not sure, but it is close, 65 mountains over 14,000 feet. Colorado has 56 of them. Colorado is the only State in the Union that has no water coming in. It is the Mother of Rivers. It is called the Mother State of Rivers. It is a natural beauty. So if you have an opportunity, go visit the sand dunes, go visit the Air Force Academy, go to a Rockies game, go over in Glenwood Springs. Glenwood Springs, the mountains around it have some scars as a result of this fire, but that famous Hot Springs pool, still open for business. So I would hope that some of my colleagues give that their consideration and head for Colorado. It is a great State. Now I want to change subjects entirely. The next subject I want to talk about is on the minds of a lot of people in America. It is on the minds of many of my colleagues here. Pretty simple. It is called corporate greed. What has happened out there in the world of business in this fine country of ours? What has happened to the Adam Smith philosophy in ``A Wealth of Great Nations,'' the book that he wrote, that really has been a guiding foundation for capitalism in America? Well, one of the things that has happened is we have had a few, not a huge amount, but a few greedy individuals who have not only taken advantage, in my opinion, have taken criminal advantage of the public's trust, and I wanted to go through a few of those examples this evening. Because in order for capitalism to work as well as it has worked, in order for it to continue to operate, you have to have as an element of it, as a basic element of capitalism, as a basic element of our business system in this country, a business system that is admired throughout the world, you have to have as an element of it public integrity, integrity when you are dealing with the public's money; and that comes not only from the chief financial officer, not only from the chief executive officer, but it also is a fiduciary requirement of your board of directors. Let me start by looking at the corporate structure as corporations are envisioned in America. A corporation is a legal entity. It is not a person; it is a legal entity. Remember, not all corporations are big. In fact, by far, by far the majority of corporations in this country are very, very small. I will give you an example. My in-laws have a ranch. They are not big ranchers. They have a ranch. But because of corporate liability, they have incorporated their ranch. I know people who run an ice cream truck who incorporate their ice cream truck. So just because someone is incorporated does not mean they are large, and to throw the same blanket overall corporations because of the misbehavior of a few individuals in a few corporations would be a big mistake to our free enterprise system. You would be surprised if you just look out amongst your neighbors in the business world. Whether it is a Subway shop, whether it is some other kind of a trucking operation, a farming operation, you would be surprised how many of them are incorporated. So you must be careful before you criticize all of these corporate entities. Now, in America we have what we call in the corporate structure as it is envisioned, as it has been practiced since corporations first came around, you have the president or the chief executive officer. Let us call it the chief executive officer of the corporation. Now, a lot of people think that the chief executive officer is the top dog, that i","word.count":8868,"sep11":0.842696629213483,"years":2002.70224719101,"days":2742,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.885921267813225,"Topic 2":0.033486574759899,"Topic 3":0.00914973087552013,"Topic 4":0.023437729723082,"Topic 5":0.00692405120333809,"Topic 6":0.00825631725377534,"Topic 7":0.00878046718238476,"Topic 8":0.0130620605699572,"Topic 9":0.00791970261028558,"Topic 10":0.00306209800853293},{"id":"10419960086139","body":"Orrin Hatch: That is correct. The extraordinary circumstances necessary for a grant of 212 relief should refer to the insignificance of the crime, and to substantial contributions to society made by the alien. To qualify for section 212 or analogous relief, despite the existence of a criminal conviction, an alien will have to show substantial benefits this county from granting the relief--not the potential hardship to the alien from not granting relief. I understand your concern that relief under this section will not be so limited, since it has not been so limited in practice in the past. We believed, however, that passage of the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act sufficiently demonstrated the Congress' serious concern about the abuse of section 212, that we could expect Immigration Judges to begin using their discretion under section 212 more judiciously. As you know, the Terrorism Act eliminated 212 relief for virtually any alien who had been convicted of any crime, including some misdemeanors. Several members believed that only by eliminating Immigration Judges' discretion to grant section 212 relief to criminal aliens altogether could we prevent section 212 from being used to grant relief too freely. The prevailing view was that the Terrorism Act sent a clear message that section 212 was being abused, and that Immigration Judges could be expected to respond to that message and take a hard look at 212 relief. The partial restoration of section 212 relief for aliens who have not committed aggravated felonies will test that theory.","word.count":249,"sep11":-5.06741573033708,"years":1996.79213483146,"days":638,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0120134024624127,"Topic 2":0.22192653530625,"Topic 3":0.00712067956945065,"Topic 4":0.00488850725651991,"Topic 5":0.092209040072361,"Topic 6":0.00454852887800386,"Topic 7":0.00287100821701824,"Topic 8":0.296000069258163,"Topic 9":0.0150599408512763,"Topic 10":0.343362288128545},{"id":"10820040019087","body":"Jim Gibbons: Mr. Chairman, I rise today in very strong support of H.R. 4548, the Intelligence Authorization Act for fiscal year 2005. As the chairman of the Subcommittee on Human Intelligence, Analysis, and Counterintelligence, I can say unequivocally that H.R. 4548 is one of the best, most far-reaching, most constructively critical, and urgently needed authorization bills that I have been involved in. The bill makes urgently needed fixes to the CIA's human intelligence collection capability that even the DCI suggested was 5 years away from being adequate. I do not believe we can or should wait 5 years, and it also authorizes a very sizeable amount beyond the DCI's base request to ensure we keep up the maximum possible operational tempo against the counterterrorism and counterproliferation targets, both inside and outside the theater of war. In the area of analysis, significant new funds will be provided to address a critical concern: the simple lack of analytical depth. The DI analytical cadre is badly in need of bench strength and real expertise. We have been burning up our analysts in wartime conditions and shipping the majority of them to cover pressing counterterrorism requirements since the mid-1990s without being able to adequately backfill positions. Those analysts need to have the right skills, firsthand exposure to countries or issues they cover, cultural appreciation and, if at all possible, the necessary foreign language skills in order to be effective, and H.R. 4548 addresses all of these issues, particularly with regard to language, which has consistently been a high-priority item for the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and a pressing need for the whole intelligence community. The bill addresses counterintelligence shortfalls, ensures that the necessary infrastructure for field operations, training, and a host of other important activities are adequately funded, and brings astonishingly new technical tools into play. The bill continues the committee's long-standing efforts to get the CIA's dangerously flawed compensation reform plan back on track; and it demonstrates that we strongly support a more aggressive, risk-taking, innovative intelligence collection posture. Such a posture would finally give us a fighting chance to penetrate terrorist groups. It would also allow us to tackle other hard-target countries, countries that have plans and intentions to do us harm. Overall, H.R. 4548 demonstrates that we are going to back up our spies and our analysts when it counts the most. To my distinguished colleagues on both sides of the aisle, this war we are in is not just about Iraq or about Afghanistan or about where Osama bin Laden may be hiding. It is truly a global war on terrorism with significant global challenges; and these include money laundering, illicit traffic, the preaching of hate, kidnapping, extortion, and even at the national level, as we saw, the Madrid train bombing and the elections that followed. It is a war that is going to take time to win. It is a war that is going to take fortitude to win, and it is a war that is going to take a substantial and continued investment in our intelligence community. I ask my distinguished colleagues to support H.R. 4548 for the sake of our Nation's security. Some of my colleagues across the aisle have decided that it is not important to provide for the intelligence community in the middle of the global war on terrorism, and I say it could not be more important. This bill moves us closer to acquiring the capabilities and directions that are needed not only to win the war on terror but to win the peace in Iraq and to make sure we do not forget about the rest of the world. We must never forget that the actions of others affects U.S. national security interests. We must never retreat in the face of evil. Vote ``yes'' on H.R. 4548 because it is urgently needed. The Nation simply cannot afford to shortchange its men and women out on the frontlines.","word.count":653,"sep11":2.85393258426966,"years":2004.71348314607,"days":3458,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.383937081130252,"Topic 2":0.0360534511731845,"Topic 3":0.0242077193332679,"Topic 4":0.0206132914882028,"Topic 5":0.00951834480112474,"Topic 6":0.0129928286347289,"Topic 7":0.0126549781091506,"Topic 8":0.250543790700392,"Topic 9":0.23186500492612,"Topic 10":0.0176135097035761},{"id":"10820040025398","body":"Pete Stark: Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time I really meant to talk about celebrating the 35th anniversary of Apollo 11, but I can see that my distinguished colleague from California was there with me. I thought we were really talking about accounting, and we are talking about H.R. 3574, which is appropriate, because it is sheer lunacy. While our soldiers are fighting overseas, our children are crying out for better schools, 45 million people have no health insurance, we have set the goal today of ``Let's help the rich get richer.'' Yes, sir, Mr. Speaker, let us give more money to the millionaires. Frankly speaking, do you know how high gas prices have gone? Do you know how much jet fuel costs? Do you know how much private jet pilots earn? We must help those people so they do not have to go from $4,000 to $5,000 to fly those little things. And that is what this bill today is doing. I am glad to see we are helping. Why? Right now, corporations can deduct stock options for tax purposes, ha-ha, and not pay the income tax, but they do not have to report those expenses to shareholders on their SEC financial statements. That is what I call sleight of hand. You cannot have it both ways. If you want to not deduct options, then do not take them off your income tax. It makes some sense. This accounting loophole was encouraged by companies like Enron and Cisco to artificially inflate the value of their company while deceiving their investors and evading corporate income tax. It is much simpler than moving to Bermuda. Even Alan Greenspan has criticized this practice. To fix this problem, the FASB board has drafted a rule requiring that we expense the options. It makes some sense. But rather than following FASB, a board made up of professional accountants, I might add, to implement a sensible rule, why, Congress has decided to use their accounting expertise. I look around the room at my fellow Congressmen, and wonder how many of them have taken the accounting course I took? And if they did, they all know that debits are in the column next to the windows, except as one looks around this Chamber, there are windows on four sides. No wonder we are confused. So let the FASB rule be damned; we are going to set some rules of our own about accounting around here. Do my colleagues know what? They anticipate that there will be criticism that lets rich corporate executives off the hook, so they are going to limit it to the top five executives. I say to my colleagues, nice try, but as Warren Buffett points out, that is like saying in a large company which gives everyone a bonus, only five bonuses have to be expensed. This bill requires companies to assume also that stocks have zero volatility. Stocks with zero volatility? Now, that does not pass the laugh test. Ask Martha Stewart about stocks with no volatility. She knows something about stock volatility. I suspect Ken Lay could tell us that it is a real phenomenon that we cannot do away with by legislation. So the bill perpetuates the Bush administration's failed economic policies, while simultaneously lining the pockets of their fat cat friends. And the sponsors of this bill should be proud. It increases the deficit, it falsifies corporate earnings, and it serves the millionaires in this country well.","word.count":581,"sep11":2.92977528089888,"years":2004.7893258427,"days":3485,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.930098487425257,"Topic 2":0.0229410333774247,"Topic 3":0.00484966726142641,"Topic 4":0.0125302927647712,"Topic 5":0.00483906758552715,"Topic 6":0.00546348874831891,"Topic 7":0.0037513485669578,"Topic 8":0.00874426700576677,"Topic 9":0.0047466626059853,"Topic 10":0.00203568465856448},{"id":"10720010022713","body":"Ike Skelton: Mr. Speaker, this hallowed day, the anniversary of the terrible terrorist attacks upon the United States, is one that is observed throughout America. The eloquence of our colleagues in this House has stirred our hearts, described our attitudes, and revealed the Nation's character. America's tragedy is mourned this day throughout the world, too. It is important for Americans to understand and appreciate the outpouring of support, the gestures of solidarity, and the prayers of the faithful bestowed upon us by the people of the world. As cochairman of the Congressional Ukrainian Caucus, I rise today to speak about one country's goodwill toward the American people in commemoration of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack. Throughout my tenure in Congress, I have always been an ardent supporter of democratic development in Ukraine. The full commercial and strategic potential of a democratic Ukraine is staggering and the desire for freedom is deeply routed in the American psyche. Mr. Speaker, in the House the days and the weeks following the attacks, the Ukrainian people grieved with America and the rest of the world. The sentiments of the Ukrainian people were echoed in a letter from Bishop Stanislaw Shyrokoradiuk of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kyiv-Zhytomyr. Here is what the bishop said, what he wrote: ``I would like to present to you and in you, to all American people, our condolences because of the terrible tragedy that has stricken the whole world. ``We have been deeply shaken to know about the series of acts of terrorism that happened in the United States of America yesterday. ``It has been an awful blow by its cruelty and scale that struck not only the U.S.A., but all humanity. I received this notice during spiritual retreats in our Higher Spiritual Seminary in Vorzel, where all priests of our Diocese came. As a sign of our unity and sympathy in your grief, we celebrated Holy Mass for the souls of the departed and prayed for all victims. May the Lord strengthen them by His grace that they may outlive this horrible disaster. ``There are Divine Services and prayers said for the souls of the departed victims, and for all of those who have suffered, in all of our churches. ``These day our hearts and prayers are with you and your people. ``Sincerely Yours, Bishop Stanislaw Shyrokoradiuk, the Vicar general of Kyiv Zhytomyr Diocese.'' Bishop Shyrokoradiuk in Ukraine sent that the day after. As a country, Ukraine immediately declared its solidarity with the United States, offering its support morally, technically, militarily and with the capabilities of its infrastructure. Ukraine's stance clearly demonstrated its friendship with the United States and the forces of freedom. Most helpful has been Ukraine's clearance of airspace for nearly 5,000 aircraft flying in from Afghanistan and aid in transporting allied troops and materiel by air and train. Ukraine also provided planes and crews in order to provide transportation for coalition forces and humanitarian missions over Iran. Ukrainian security forces have been cooperating with Americans offering intelligence regarding the fighting in Afghanistan and other security concerns. Ukraine's international efforts in leading the Georgia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, and Georgia Group, called GUUAM, to secure strategic transport corridors from terrorist activity have helped secure the entire regional community. Ukraine has cooperated with us in blocking and investigating the financial transactions and accounts of suspected terrorists. Just today, Mr. Speaker, Ukraine's parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, unanimously passed three resolutions in support of America. One extends Ukraine's profound sympathy to the families and friends of victims. The other directs the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine to establish a memorial at the World Trade Center in New York to the Ukrainians who perished there. The third resolution outlines Ukraine's commitment to the future of freedom and reaffirms Ukraine's solidarity in the war on terrorism and its commitment to strengthening international peace and security. This latter resolution lucidly addresses issues of global concern, including environmental problems and global health issues. Currently, Ukraine is preparing to send two IL-76 cargo planes loaded with small arms, ammunitions, and other military equipment to outfit the Afghan National Army. This morning, the President of Ukraine, Leonid Kuchma, met with our ambassador, Carlos Pascual. The President pledged his country's continued support for Operation Enduring Freedom and expressed his regret for the loss of lives in America 1 year ago. This afternoon, Ukraine's Ambassador Kostyantyn Gryshchenko visited me in my office here in Washington, D.C. and extended his country's condolences, support, and solidarity. He asked me to express to the House Ukraine's commitment to America's war on terrorism. He assured me that the prayers of countless Ukrainians are for the repose of the souls of the victims. At this moment in Kyiv, Mr. Speaker, Ukrainians are paying their respects as they observe a large photo collage of Ground Zero. The display honors the emergency workers and heroes of 9-11. There is a similar exhibit at the Ukrainian National Gallery; and on Friday, they will hold a commemorative concert at the National Opera. Ukraine's condemnation of international terrorism, its much- appreciated support on the war on terrorism, its tough, newly enacted laws to combat terrorism and its commitment to fight at the side of the United States and its allies for civil society and democracy clearly demonstrates the role Ukraine and her people intend to play. Ukraine's support for America is deeply appreciated. Mr. Speaker, I thank the people of Ukraine for their condolences and camaraderie and commend Ukraine's leaders for standing shoulder to shoulder with the United States. I will submit for the Record at this time the resolution that was adopted this morning by Ukraine's parliament.","word.count":162,"sep11":0.00842696629213483,"years":2001.86797752809,"days":2445,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.816860210123468,"Topic 2":0.0609023574731418,"Topic 3":0.013143812310843,"Topic 4":0.0295245831336967,"Topic 5":0.0133211261880138,"Topic 6":0.0130742790044587,"Topic 7":0.0103258909122976,"Topic 8":0.023024030839088,"Topic 9":0.0138806712367698,"Topic 10":0.00594303877822288},{"id":"10920050040158","body":"Tom Lantos: The regular order is now to go to Senator Nelson, is that correct?","word.count":176,"sep11":4.37359550561798,"years":2006.23314606742,"days":3999,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0540736374160624,"Topic 2":0.314920095582471,"Topic 3":0.0276874822542354,"Topic 4":0.178918061636343,"Topic 5":0.345691846936127,"Topic 6":0.00831996407629617,"Topic 7":0.00150573437838288,"Topic 8":0.0121763667758386,"Topic 9":0.0253185356164426,"Topic 10":0.0313882753278},{"id":"10519970002671","body":"NA","word.count":161,"sep11":-4.61797752808989,"years":1997.24157303371,"days":798,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.757005251372638,"Topic 2":0.0982541114748899,"Topic 3":0.00959189761415255,"Topic 4":0.0466726319671383,"Topic 5":0.0600161972044232,"Topic 6":0.00463751380625518,"Topic 7":0.00430417597659315,"Topic 8":0.0108171576187287,"Topic 9":0.00479789920681022,"Topic 10":0.00390316375837083},{"id":"10920050064095","body":"Carl Levin: Mr. President, I am glad to respond, and I thank the Senator from California for the question.

I do want to thank my colleagues on the caucus, including the Chairs, the gentleman from New Jersey and the gentleman from Michigan , for their work in organizing the tribute that will take place tomorrow evening. This observance does take place every year on April 24. I hope that my comments a day earlier will attest to my earnestness and passion about the issue. It was on that date in 1915 that more than 200 Armenian religious, political and intellectual leaders were arrested in Constantinople and murdered. Over the next 8 years, persecution of Armenians intensified; and by 1923, more than 1.5 million had died and another 500,000 had gone into exile. At the end of 1923, all of the Armenian residents of Anatolia and Western Armenia had been either killed or deported. The genocide was criticized at the time by our United States Ambassador, Henry Morgenthau, who accused the Turkish authorities of ``giving the death warrant to a whole race.'' The founder of the modern Turkish nation, Kemal Ataturk, condemned the crimes perpetrated by his predecessors. Yet this forthright and sober analysis has been ignored by the United States during the last decade. The intransigence of this and prior administrations to recognizing and commemorating the Armenian genocide demonstrates our continued difficulty in reconciling the lessons of history with what we believe, and that is, those who fail to learn the lessons of history are condemned to repeat them. We have seen this continually in this century, the abject failure to learn and apply this basic principle. The Armenian genocide has been followed by the Holocaust against the Jews, mass killings in Kurdistan, Rwanda, Burundi, and Bosnia. Many of these situations are ongoing, and there seems little sense of urgency or moral imperative to resolve them. This was brought home to me when I visited the memorial of the genocide in Yerevan, Armenia, when I led the delegation there several years ago; and here in the United States I have seen the anguish on the faces of the survivors and I have talked to the families who have lost loved ones during that holocaust of the Armenians. Commemoration of the Armenian genocide is important, not only for its acknowledgment of the suffering of the Armenian people, but also for establishing a historical truth. It also demonstrates that events in Armenia, Nazi Europe, and elsewhere should be seen not as isolated incidents, but as part of a historical continuum, showing that the human community still suffers from its basic inability to resolve its problems peacefully and with mutual respect. Last year, I sent a letter to our Maryland legislators with several of my colleagues here in the House urging their support of the Maryland Day of Remembrance. I am pleased to say that last April, Maryland joined 27 other States to pass resolutions condemning the Armenian genocide. I am proud to have joined 161 of my House colleagues in sending a letter to President Bush urging him to appropriately acknowledge the Armenian genocide in his April 24 commemoration statement. We urge President Bush to follow Senator Bob Dole's message to simply ``state the truth.'' There was an English poet who once said, ``Truth is beauty, beauty, truth. We ask for the truth.''","word.count":230,"sep11":-0.387640449438202,"years":2001.47191011236,"days":2304,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0884844948289965,"Topic 2":0.144264575440697,"Topic 3":0.00795948439234403,"Topic 4":0.0145042650043089,"Topic 5":0.145214102474883,"Topic 6":0.00322189366097554,"Topic 7":0.530189449459069,"Topic 8":0.0120922160359322,"Topic 9":0.0296136748076793,"Topic 10":0.0244558438951142},{"id":"10920060043792","body":"John Kerry: Mr. President, as Congress comes back in session for a five-week work period, it is high time we put partisan bickering aside and take up real issues that will improve the lives of America's hard- working families. Today, I rise to address one such problem--the growing shortage of quality child care for our country's future generations. Over the past 50 years, the United States has witnessed a 43 percent increase in the number of dual- earner and single-parent families. Furthermore, the Census Bureau estimates that more than six million children are left home alone on a regular basis. Nationwide, more households than ever are struggling to make ends meet, while providing safe, nurturing environments for their children to grow up in. For many, child care is not a choice, but a necessity in this endeavor. That is why we owe it to our Nation's families to increase the availability of quality child care--because strong, healthy families build a stronger America. As the Ranking Member on the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I firmly believe that we can work with the Small Business Administration to cultivate and expand existing child care facilities. In light of this, I rise today to introduce the Child Care Lending Pilot Act of 2006, which establishes a three-year pilot program enabling small, non-profit child care businesses to be eligible for the SBA's 504 loans. With affordable fixed low interest rates and long terms, 504 loans play a vital role in spurring economic development and the rebuilding of communities. Current law permits for-profit child care small businesses to finance building repairs and expand existing facilities through these 504 loans. However, their non-profit counterparts are unable to access the same financing through the SBA. Given that the majority of child care centers in many States across the country operate as non-profits, this system is shutting out the lion's share of facilities from obtaining necessary funds to provide quality care for the families they serve. The Child Care Lending Pilot Act of 2006 reverses this trend. By allowing non-profit child care businesses to apply for 504 lending, the legislation enables these entities to put down only 10 to 20 percent of the loan with a term of up to 20 years. With low, predictable monthly payments, these non-profit centers can then invest in the families they provide services to, by updating and improving their buildings and materials without breaking the bank or raising fees. Since the industry is not high-earning overall, a majority of child care centers do not have an abundance of easily accessible capital. Proposals that call for centers to simply charge less or cut back on employees are not the way to make child care more affordable for families and do not serve in the children's best interests. An adequate staff is crucial in ensuring that children receive proper supervision and support to foster their development and learning. Furthermore, if centers are asked to decrease operating costs in order to lower costs absorbed by families, the safety and quality of the child care provided would most likely be in jeopardy. In recent years, the Children's Defense Fund estimated that in all but one State, the average annual cost of child care in urban area child care centers is more than the average annual cost of public college tuition. Additionally, they projected that child care can easily cost between $4,000 to $10,000 per year in cities and States across the Nation. Clearly, these high costs pose virtually insurmountable hurdles for low-income families in need of quality care for their children. Although many States have implemented grant and loan programs to help these child care small businesses, more must be done--not only to improve the quality of care, but also the overall supply of child care facilities for the Nation's neediest families. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation and allow non-profit child care providers to access SBA 504 financing for their facilities and the children they serve. Funded entirely through fees, this legislation requires no appropriation. Additionally, it is consistent with the three-year SBA reauthorization cycle. This legislation is the product of work on this issue in both the 107th and 108th Congresses. Similar legislation was introduced in 2002, S. 2891, however the four year provision made this program inconsistent with the cycle of SBA reauthorization. To remedy this, I reintroduced the measure in 2003 as S. 822, making the act a three-year pilot program consistent with the cycle of reauthorization. This pilot program was also part of the larger Senate Small Business reauthorization legislation in the last Congress, S. 1375. Unfortunately, this innovative proposal to expand child care, which had bipartisan support, was cut out of the final authorization package when a scaled-back version of the reauthorization legislation, without most Democratic initiatives, was added to the FY2005 omnibus appropriations bill. Although there is no quick-fix solution for the Nation's child care shortage and lack of quality facilities, this bill marks an important step in the right direction by allowing non-profit child care centers to receive SBA loans. I hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will recognize the vital role that early education plays in the development of fine minds and productive citizens, and realize that in this great Nation, child care should be available to all families in all income brackets. The Child Care Lending Pilot Act of 2006 is a sound investment in our Nation's future--our children. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: S. 2651. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Education to make grants to educational organizations to carry out educational programs about the Holocaust; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.","word.count":977,"sep11":4.73876404494382,"years":2006.59831460674,"days":4129,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.726065390569613,"Topic 2":0.170107183678536,"Topic 3":0.0118239031434782,"Topic 4":0.0107105149132878,"Topic 5":0.0180274481521599,"Topic 6":0.00388070618975079,"Topic 7":0.00285233954198905,"Topic 8":0.0185381291595221,"Topic 9":0.00706363864818905,"Topic 10":0.0309307460034751},{"id":"10519980015966","body":"John Spratt: Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1\\1/2\\ minutes to respond Mr. Chairman, first let me respond with respect to the tax cuts.

It seemed to be in a period of only 1 month they came together in a bipartisan manner to uphold the Constitution. Do my colleagues realize that the hearings in the other body, Whitewater hearings, have cost this country $900,000, $900,000? In addition, it is duplicative of the special prosecutor that continues. And now we have them asking to extend it to July, just a month before the conventions. Might I wonder what this is all about? Politics in the worst sort of way?

Get on with the business of the proposed legislation that I have, the Fairness and Equal Opportunity Act of 1996, which will restore the faith of minorities and women that this Government will be open to them for jobs, education, and contracts.

I have more to say, but at this time, I am going to yield to my colleague, the senior Senator from Idaho, Larry Craig.","word.count":287,"sep11":-5.10955056179775,"years":1996.75,"days":623,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.935614817006117,"Topic 2":0.0209547219477488,"Topic 3":0.00450023644460965,"Topic 4":0.0114616240534667,"Topic 5":0.00445599102932173,"Topic 6":0.00528036842675391,"Topic 7":0.0034488169314484,"Topic 8":0.00812781092534814,"Topic 9":0.00431008561050413,"Topic 10":0.00184552762468127},{"id":"10519970013425","body":"Frank Pallone: Mr. Speaker, I rise to commend my good friend, Bill Young, for his tireless efforts to promote and strengthen the National Bone Marrow Donor Registry.

I have a couple comments to add to this discussion. First, with respect to the budget negotiations, there ought not be, under any condition, another Government shutdown. It is, in my judgment, a symbol for the entire country of failure when some people here in the Congress decide that shutting down the Government should be used to accomplish their ends. A shutdown asks the American taxpayer to pay for work that is not performed. It asks some Federal employees to come to work and accept the promise of pay later, but it deprives them of their paycheck. It sends the other Federal workers home without pay, when they have bills to pay and obligations to meet and want to come to work. The shutdown dangles Federal workers at the end of a string, saying to them: ``You are the ones we will use as pawns in this budget debate.'' Those who advocate shutdowns, and there are some, demonstrate that you can have a hard head and a cold heart at the same time. But that advocacy does not show any capacity to think this budget crisis through to a decent conclusion. We ought not have another Government shutdown under any conditions, because it serves no interests except to hurt this country. All of us, it seems to me, in Congress, ought to pledge never to let another Government shutdown happen again on our watch. Now, about balancing the budget, we should balance the budget. I have said before and I will say again, because it is worth saying, I think the Republicans deserve credit for pushing for a balanced budget. You deserve credit for that. Democrats deserve credit for pushing a balanced budget with the right kind of priorities. We ought to get the best of both rather than the worst of each. People talk about ``families balance their budgets.'' Can anyone in here think about a family that sits around their table at night and says, ``We need to develop a plan to balance our budget, so let's see, we are going to help our oldest son make payments on the Mercedes. We need to send a monthly stipend to rich Uncle Louie over in Nashville. How are we going to pay for all that? Let's cut back on mama's health care and let's pull junior out of college.'' Does that sound like a logical approach for a family, in making their decisions about how to deal with their budget situation? Not hardly. Nor is it the right way for Congress to deal with its budget situation. Interestingly enough, we have come to a point where there is a lot of agreement on the budget-balancing question. There are a number of areas of agreement but there are a couple of large areas of disagreement. Most people, in assessing this problem, would start by saying you do not balance the budget by cutting your revenue. I think everybody on all sides of the aisle ought to decide to abandon tax cuts at this point until we have honestly balanced the budget, and then come back and assess the question of how you change the tax code and how you cut taxes for middle-income families. But I say to all parties in these negotiations, it would make sense, it seems to me, to abandon the proposals to cut taxes because I think everyone in this Chamber who thinks about it honestly will understand, every dollar of tax cut during the 7 years will be borrowed and added to the Federal deficit. Every single dollar of tax cut will be borrowed. I say abandon the tax cut. Deal with the spending issues in a real way, and let us balance the budget. The problem we have at the moment is some are insisting on a tax cut well over $200 billion. In order to make room for that, you have to have deeper cuts in Medicare. That is where the scales are balanced, or, better said, out of balance. In order to get this tax cut on this side up to $12,000-some, you have to pull down the Medicare costs. You have to cut Medicare to accommodate the tax cut. That is the dilemma. Abandon the tax cut, balance the budget honestly, reach an agreement, and do it in a way that represents the best interests of the priorities of the American people. Let us make sure we have enough money for education. Let us provide for health care for senior citizens. Let us do the things that are necessary to protect this country's environment. Let us do this the right way. It can be done. There are good Republicans and good Democrats who think clearly about these things. We ought to be able to come together to reach an agreement, in my judgment.","word.count":814,"sep11":-5.81741573033708,"years":1996.04213483146,"days":371,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.028232057654678,"Topic 2":0.160625264440272,"Topic 3":0.00511006327260137,"Topic 4":0.0543315791014395,"Topic 5":0.00619294428544333,"Topic 6":0.0158369301789733,"Topic 7":0.70657219325761,"Topic 8":0.0048664709394549,"Topic 9":0.0162049044139603,"Topic 10":0.00202759245556688},{"id":"10620000019729","body":"Joe Moakley: Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend the gentleman from New York for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule but in opposition to H.J. Res. 90, the resolution that it makes in order. This rule provides 2 hours of general debate and the time is divided equally between the proponents, the chair and ranking member of the Committee on Ways and Means, and the opponents, the gentleman from Oregon and the gentleman from Texas . This rule is necessary, Mr. Speaker, because of a provision in the Uruguay Round Agreements Act that authorized the President to accept the United States' membership in the World Trade Organization. Sections 124 and 125 of this act require that the President every 5 years report to the Congress on United States participation in the World Trade Organization. The purpose of this report, according to the Committee on Ways and Means, is to provide an opportunity for Congress to evaluate the transition of the GATT to the WTO, and also to assess periodically whether continued membership in this organization is in the best interest of the United States. After receipt of this report, Mr. Speaker, any Member of Congress may introduce a joint resolution to withdraw congressional approval of the agreement that establishes the WTO. That resolution is on a fast track which requires committee action within 45 days and up to 20 hours of floor consideration within 90 days unless a rule establishing debate is enacted prior to that time. This is the rule that we are working on. Mr. Speaker, I do not support withdrawal of the United States from the World Trade Organization. The World Trade Organization and its predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, have opened many foreign markets for U.S. goods and services around the globe, particularly for farmers and for business. While I have expressed opposition to the WTO's opening of its membership to countries such as China, I believe it would be a mistake for the United States to leave this organization and to isolate itself from the world's other industrial nations. I think most would agree that overall the benefits of the WTO outweigh the costs. However, having said that, there is much room for improvement in the way the WTO operates. The 5-year report by the President to Congress serves to highlight areas where improvements could be made. A significant portion of our current booming economy is due to increased trade abroad through the rules of the WTO and GATT. But this organization needs to be about more than just trade and tariffs. It needs to expand its thinking and its priorities and its rulemaking to the quality of life for those populations it has attempted to serve. The WTO policy needs to focus on improving working conditions, not simply global trade but increased worker protection, increased environmental protection, and respect for human rights. Mr. Speaker, these issues need to be part of any meaningful trade discussions or negotiations, and any rules regarding these areas need to be vigorously enforced. One of the most important changes would be to lift the veil of secrecy under which the WTO functions. This organization operates almost entirely behind closed doors, and such a policy has only served to heighten the mistrust of those who already question the WTO. This mistrust can be minimized only, only if there is an opening of the agenda and opening of the minds of the membership on the WTO. There is an urgent need for public access, as well to public input into the WTO. We must address the current makeup of the World Trade Organization and particularly the total absence of representatives from labor, the total absence of representatives from the environment, and total absence from people representing human rights groups and from any other WTO advisory groups. These entities should be given more access to this organization as it develops its policies and rules that ultimately impact in all of these areas. Enforcement of actions that have been negotiated by the members of the World Trade Organization must be tightened. The creation of the World Trade Organization was, in part, an effort by the GATT to legally bind member governments to GATT's rules. American trade negotiators have been successful in winning trade disputes and other violations, but, unfortunately, the enforcement to correct these cases has not been satisfactory. Agreements that have been reached must be enforced for all involved parties. Whether we like it or not, Mr. Speaker, the world is changing. We truly are moving towards a global economy. The World Trade Organization currently has a membership of 135 nations, with another 32 who seek to join this organization. I think it would be very detrimental to the United States to pull out of the World Trade Organization at this time. But that does not mean that we should turn our backs on those people and those issues that desperately need to be part of the World Trade Organization's agenda. We can probably do more than any nation to see that these critical but overlooked matters become top priorities with our trading partners. Mr. Speaker, let us pass the rule, but let us defeat H. Res. 90. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.","word.count":898,"sep11":-1.25561797752809,"years":2000.60393258427,"days":1995,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.044843010808234,"Topic 2":0.379428893162469,"Topic 3":0.332091610280534,"Topic 4":0.0804759979890984,"Topic 5":0.079783263663205,"Topic 6":0.00883572988478615,"Topic 7":0.00284031908943353,"Topic 8":0.00888153881329055,"Topic 9":0.0583449771253721,"Topic 10":0.00447465918357738},{"id":"10419950141378","body":"Tom Daschle: Mr. President, I want to commend the distinguished ranking member for the excellent job he has done in representing our caucus and commend all of the Members who have played a role in on our side, as we have debated this bill.

When the lowest 20 percent of the people in this country lose more than all the other 80 percent combined, that is extreme.

No one voted to cut Medicaid $163 billion to provide tax breaks for those who do not need them. The distinguished Senator from New Mexico talked about protecting our children.

I know people in his home State greatly respect him. I read somewhere that he has the highest approval rating of any politician in the State of Iowa. I am sure that is true and I can understand why. It is because he is straight, down to Earth, and honest. He tells it like he sees it, no guile. I want Senators to know that this is my impression, as well. I say this because when he explains the provisions of this bill, I hope people listen. Senator Grassley is not one to gild the lily, not one to indulge in inflammatory rhetoric, not one to exaggerate. He is someone who tells it like it is. This is a very important personal quality of his, and one that I revere deeply. I thank the Senator for allowing me to work with him as the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. I would like to take a few minutes to discuss the Medicare conference report before us. I am sure a lot of people across the country have heard statements by many Senators and House Members and are wondering who is telling the truth. They hear a set of allegations from one side and lots of responses from the other side. It must be incredibly difficult to determine the truth. A few days ago, Senator Breaux and I met with 20 or 25 House Democrats. The group is known as the New Democrats. Senator Breaux and I explained to them what was in the bill. Over and over again, the New Democrats asked: What is going on here? Our leadership tells us one thing and you are telling us something else. Whom are we to believe? Senator Breaux and I explained the bill to the best of our ability. We tried to be honest and straight with the facts. It is my belief that the facts are usually controlling. Once people understand the facts of a bill or legislation, they can make up their own minds. It was our intention to just give the facts so these House Members could make up their own minds. I suspect that a lot of them were in a difficult place: stuck between their leadership, which was pressuring them to do one thing, and the facts which were inclining them in the other direction. I further suspect that many people watching across the country tonight are wondering the same thing. There are compelling speeches on both sides of this debate. Who is telling the truth? After all, that is what it is all about. I am going to do the best I can to explain why I am supporting this Medicare legislation, why I personally think it is a good bill. I am going to use the facts, as opposed to rhetoric. I am not a great rhetorical speaker. As with the Senator from Iowa, I tend not to embellish. Maybe it is because we are from agricultural states. We have learned to accept that we cannot control everything--we cannot control the weather for the crops and the livestock; we cannot control the market price. We accept reality for what it is and tell it like it is because that is the way we have grown up. I will do my very best to give a fair take on facts of this bill. Why do I support this bill? For many years, Congress has been trying to pass legislation that gives prescription drug benefits to seniors. For many years we have been talking about it. Some years we have come pretty close. Last year, for example, we were very close. I can remember a meeting I had convened in my office with the key Senators: Olympia Snowe, Ted Kennedy, Chuck Grassley, Senator Graham, and four or five or six other Senators from both sides of the aisle--liberals and conservatives. We came very close. But in the end, partisan politics dominated--I think because some wanted an issue, not a solution. We were pulled apart, and in the last moments, we were unable to pass a prescription drug bill. Here we are again today. We are even closer this year because we have actual legislation that has passed both bodies of the Congress, and a conference report before us. It is not possible to get any closer. If we do not pass legislation this time, I do not know if we ever will. And this would be a tragedy. This bill provides $400 billion over 10 years to create a prescription drug benefits for seniors. This is what the debate comes down to. We know the importance of this bill because drug prices are increasing rapidly, while at the same time, drugs are becoming ever- more important. They oftentimes replace expensive hospital procedures. And new medications are constantly being developed. New, so-called miracle drugs are being developed today that will help treat many different illnesses in the future. Many of our seniors with low incomes and fixed incomes simply cannot afford the drugs they depend on. It is critical that we pass this legislation. Every other country in the industrialized world provides prescription drug benefits for their seniors. We are the United States of America. Why in the world do we not provide prescription drug benefits for our seniors? We should. And we now have the opportunity before us. I do not know when we are going to get this opportunity again. If we do not act now, the chances of passing prescription drug benefits for seniors in the next several years is very slim. Next year we will be faced with higher budget pressures: The national debt is increasing; our deficits are rising due primarily to uncertainties overseas--Iraq and Iran; due to terrorism; and due to greater domestic needs. If we do not pass prescription drug benefits now, we are unlikely to have another opportunity again. If we do not act today, the $400 billion will not be there next year. I also support this legislation because of its very generous low- income subsidies for one-third of all senior citizens. These senior citizens, one-third of all senior citizens, will have 90 percent of their drug costs paid for. Under this legislation, 90 percent of their drug costs are going to be paid for by the federal government. This is a very important measure in this bill. It provides very strong low-income protections. I do not know if we are going to have these protections again in future Medicare legislation, if we even have future Medicare bills. When are we going to again have such generous assistance for our low-income seniors? An additional reason I support this legislation is that it contains a strong government fall-back plan. This is a technical term which means that when there are not two private drug plans available in any region, a senior is able to access a guaranteed government fall-back plan for their drug benefits. The only question is: Are there two private plans in any given region of the country? If there are, your prescription drug benefits are covered through the private plan with all of the guarantees that are written in the legislation to ensure that seniors are not taken advantage of. If there are not two private plans in the area, then the Government fall-back plan goes into effect. The bottom line is that all seniors in America will get a prescription drug benefit. All seniors in America are covered by this bill, whether it is in a private drug plan or through the government fall-back plan. This is what we mean by a strong Government fall-back-- all seniors will get the prescription drug benefit. It is true that the House bill did not include a strong government fallback. But we are talking about the Conference report. And in this legislation, all seniors will have access to the drug benefit. The fourth reason I support this legislation is rural payment equalization, as well as other strong provider provisions. During the many years I have been in this body, I have worked hard to make sure that Montana and other rural States get the same payments for hospitals and doctors as urban States, as the big States. We have been fighting for this for years. Finally this legislation addresses this inequity. If this bill does not pass, I do not know when we are going to be able to address this issue. Nothing is guaranteed in the future. Times change. Congresses changes. It is difficult to predict the future. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. We have a bird in the hand now. We have strong rural provisions in this legislation. If it does not pass now, the chances of rural areas getting a square deal and a level playing field are going to be in serious jeopardy. I say to those Senators from rural states, how can you vote against a bill and deny increased payments to your home states when you are probably not going to get them again, when you have been fighting so hard to get them for so many years? I would now like to turn to another issue that has been discussed frequently and which is of great concern to many Senators, and well it should be. As indicated on this chart, employer-sponsored retiree coverage is declining. Eighty percent of companies offered retiree health care coverage in 1991. In 1996, it fell to 71 percent. In 1999, it fell to 66 percent. In 2001, it fell to 62 percent, and 2003, 61 percent. There is a steady decline of companies dropping or reducing their retiree coverage. You might ask, Why is that happening? It is happening because of competitive pressures. Companies want to cut back on costs wherever they can to maximize their profits. Retiree health benefits is one area where they are cutting down their costs. They are reducing coverage for their retirees. It is inevitable and it is happening. Why do I mention this? What does this bill do to address this phenomenon? This is an extremely important point, and I hope Senators and staff are listening. This bill discourages employer retiree droppage; discourages, not encourages, it. It provides tax-free subsidies for companies to discourage them from dropping their retiree benefits. This bill provides $88 billion--$88 billion--to companies for their retiree plans. Eighty-eight billion dollars is going to companies to discourage them from dropping their retiree plans. The Congressional Budget Office said under the Senate bill that there would be about a 37-percent droppag","word.count":3183,"sep11":2.25561797752809,"years":2004.11516853933,"days":3245,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0137191012854617,"Topic 2":0.0314003812924634,"Topic 3":0.0139801906046864,"Topic 4":0.0014151401789224,"Topic 5":0.105512119303623,"Topic 6":0.593209053717264,"Topic 7":0.0015693022224788,"Topic 8":0.22982242479101,"Topic 9":0.0075888229594565,"Topic 10":0.00178346364463392},{"id":"10620000053475","body":"Rod Grams: Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes today to talk about the Department of Interior's recent decision to ban snowmobiling in most units of the National Park System. While the Interior Department's recent decision will not ban snowmobiling in Minnesota's Voyageurs National Park, it will impact snowmobiling in at least two units of the Park System in my home State--Grand Portage National Monument and the St. Croix National Scenic Riverway. In addition, this decision will greatly impact Minnesotans who enjoy snowmobiling, not only in Minnesota, but in many of our National Parks, particularly in the western part of our country. When I think of snowmobiling in Minnesota, I think of families and friends. I think of people who come together on their free time to enjoy the wonders of Minnesota in a way no other form of transportation allows them. I also think of the fact that in many instances snowmobiles in Minnesota are used for much more than just recreation. For some, they're a mode of transportation when snow blankets our state. For others, snowmobiles provide a mode of search and rescue activity. Whatever the reason, snowmobiles are an extremely important aspect of commerce, travel, recreation, and safety in my home state. Minnesota, right now, is home to over 280,000 registered snowmobiles and 20,000 miles of snowmobile trails. According to the Minnesota United Snowmobilers Association, an association with over 51,000 individual members, Minnesota's 311 snowmobile riding clubs raised $264,000 for charity in 1998 alone. Snowmobiling creates over 6,600 jobs and $645 million of economic activity in Minnesota. Minnesota is home to two major snowmobile manufacturers--Arctic Cat and Polaris. And yes, I enjoy my own snowmobiles. People who enjoy snowmobiling come from all walks of life. They are farmers, lawyers, nurses, construction workers, loggers, and miners. They are men, women, and young adults. They are people who enjoy the outdoors, time with their families, and the recreational opportunities our diverse climate offers. These are people who not only enjoy the natural resources through which they ride, but understand the important balance between enjoying and conserving our natural resources. Just 3 years ago, I took part in a snowmobile ride through a number of cities and trails in northern Minnesota. While our ride didn't take us through a unit of the National Park Service, it did take us through parks, forests, and trails that sustain a diverse amount of plant and animal species. I talked with my fellow riders and I learned a great deal about the work their snowmobile clubs undertake to conserve natural resources, respect the integrity of the land upon which they ride, and educate their members about the need to ride responsibly. The time I spent with these individuals and the time I have spent on my own snowmobiles have given me a great respect for both the quality and enjoyment of the recreational experience and the need to ride responsibly and safely. They have also given me reason to strongly disagree with the approach the Park Service has chosen in banning snowmobiles from our National Parks. I was stunned to read of the severity of the Park Service's ban and the rhetoric used by Assistant Secretary Donald J. Barry in announcing the ban. In the announcement, Assistant Secretary Barry said, ``The time has come for the National Park Service to pull in its welcome mat for recreational snowmobiling.'' He went on to say that snowmobiles were, ``machines that are no longer welcome in our national parks.'' These are not the words of someone who is approaching a sensitive issue in a thoughtful way. These are the words of a bureaucrat whose agenda has been handwritten for him by those opposed to snowmobiling. The last time I checked, Congress is supposed to be setting the agenda of the Federal agencies. The last time I checked, Congress should be determining who is and is not welcome on our Federal lands. And the last time I checked, the American people own our public-lands-- not the Clinton administration and certainly not Donald J. Barry. In light of such brazenness, it's amazing to me that this administration, and some of my colleagues in Congress, question our objections to efforts that would allow the Federal Government to purchase even larger tracts of private land. If we were dealing with Federal land managers who considered the intent of Congress, who worked with local officials, or who listened to the concerns of those most impacted by Federal land-use decisions, we might be more inclined to consider their efforts. But when this administration, time and again, thumbs its nose at Congress and acts repeatedly against the will of local officials and American citizens, it is little wonder the some in Congress might not want to turn over more private land to this administration. I cannot begin to count the rules, regulations, and executive orders this administration has undertaken without even the most minimal consideration for Congress or local officials. It has happened in state after state, to Democrats and Republicans, and with little or no regard for the rule or the intent of law. I want to quote Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt from an article in the National Journal, dated May 22, 1999. In the article, Secretary Babbitt was quoted as saying: That is a remarkable statement by an extremely candid man, and his intent to work around Congress is clearly reflected in this most recent decision. Clearly, Secretary Babbit and his staff felt the rules that they've created allow them to ``pull the welcome mat for recreational users'' to our national parks. As further evidence of this administration's abuse of Congress--and therefore of the American people--Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner was quoted in the same article as saying: While Ms. Browner's words strongly imply an intent to work around Congress, at least she did not join Secretary Babbit in coming right out and admitting it. Mr. President, I for one am getting a little sick and tired of watching this administration force park users out of their parks, steal land from our States and counties, impose costly new regulations on farmers and businesses without scientific justification, and force Congress to become a spectator on many of the most controversial and important issues before the American people. It is getting to the point where I am not sure what to tell my constituents. I have been on the phone with snowmobilers in Minnesota and they ask what can be done. I start to explain that because of the filibuster in the Senate and the President's ability to veto, it will be difficult for Congress to take any action. I have found myself saying that a lot lately. Whether it is regulations on Total Maximum Daily Loads, efforts to put 50 million acres of forests in wilderness, or new rules to regulate a worker's house should they choose to work at home, this aAdministration just doesn't respect the legislative process or the role of Congress. Nor does this administration respect the jobs, traditions, cultures, of lifestyles of millions of Americans. If you are an American who has yet to be negatively impacted by the actions of this administration, just wait your turn because you were evidently at the end of the list. Sooner or later, if they get their way in the next few months, they're going to kill your job, render your private property unusable, and ban you from accessing public lands that have been accessible for generations.Regrettably, many of us in Congress are now left with the proposition of telling our constituents that we must wait for a new administration. I have to tell them that this administration is on its way out the door and they're employing a scorched earth exit strategy. And I have to warn them that the situation could get worse if a certain Vice President finds himself residing at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue next year. I have to admit, there is nothing pleasurable about telling your constituents to wait until next year. I think it is important to remember that, as Senators, we are the representatives of every one of our constituents. When I have to tell a constituent that Congress has lost its power to act on this matter, I am actually telling that constituent that he or she has lost their power on this matter. When I have to tell a snowmobiler that the administration doesn't care what Congress has to say about snowmobile in national parks, I am really telling him or her that the administration doesn't care what the American people have to say about snowmobiling in national parks. Well, I doubt any of us could've said that any better than Donald J. Barry said it himself. When forging public policy, those of us in Congress often have to consider the opinions of the state and local officials who are most impacted. If I'm going to support an action on public land, I usually contact the state and local officials who represent the area to see what they have to say. I know that if I don't get their perspective, I might miss a detail that could improve my efforts. I also know that the local officials can tell me if my efforts are necessary or if they're misplaced. They can alert me to areas where I need to forge a broader consensus and of ways in which my efforts might actually hurt the people I represent. I think that is a prudent way to forge public policy and a fair way to deal with state and local officials. I know, however, that no one from the Park Service ever contacted me to see how I felt about banning snowmobiling in Park Service units in Minnesota. I was never consulted on snowmobiling usage in Minnesota or on any complaints that I might have received from my constituents. While I've not checked with every local official in Minnesota, not one local official has called me to say that the Park Service contacted them. In fact, while I knew the Park Service was considering taking action to curb snowmobile ","word.count":1939,"sep11":-1.39044943820225,"years":2000.4691011236,"days":1947,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.259913944096959,"Topic 2":0.0550146136935849,"Topic 3":0.0204729805180791,"Topic 4":0.0240764514301882,"Topic 5":0.00743083441436215,"Topic 6":0.24808981690611,"Topic 7":0.0254653176050451,"Topic 8":0.0451364334249756,"Topic 9":0.308291822506178,"Topic 10":0.00610778540451898},{"id":"10619990041359","body":"Roscoe Bartlett: Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for allowing us the opportunity. Mr. Speaker, this motion actually reverses a policy set in legislation enacted only 3 years ago, at the bipartisan request of our Nation's governors. Provisions to repeal the Boren Amendment were included in the 1997 Balanced Budget Act. That measure was approved by the House with the support of 193 Republicans and 153 Democrats, and it was signed into law by President Clinton. I would also refer to remarks made by the President of the National Governors Association on August 8 of last year in St. Louis, Missouri, when he said, we have waived or eliminated scores of laws and regulations on Medicaid, including one we all wanted to get rid of, the so-called Boren Amendment. As I intended to explain earlier, the proposal, Mr. Speaker, is unnecessary. The Medicaid statute already includes provisions which address the gentleman's concern. Under title 19, States are specifically required to provide adequate reimbursement. Section 190230 requires States plans to, and I quote, ``provide such methods and procedures relating to the utilization of and the payment for care and services available under the plan as may be necessary to safeguard against unnecessary utilization of such care and services, and to ensure that payments are consistent with efficiency, economy and quality of care, and are sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and services are available under the plan, at least to the extent that such care and services are available to the general population in the geographic area.'' Mr. Speaker, this has been true in regulation for years, Mr. Speaker, but it was also codified in statute by the 1989 omnibus budget reconciliation act. Imposing additional mandates on the States would not accomplish any justifiable public policy purpose. The other interpretation of the gentleman's motion to instruct is that in the spirit of Halloween, he is attempting to breathe life into the now-dead Boren Amendment. History has shown us that the use of such general terms as ``adequate reimbursement'' and ``suppliers furnishing items and services'' will lead to litigation.","word.count":204,"sep11":-1.90168539325843,"years":1999.95786516854,"days":1765,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0151790488254783,"Topic 2":0.0160293920571178,"Topic 3":0.0055513694002726,"Topic 4":0.00614680547436562,"Topic 5":0.00132428549325575,"Topic 6":0.00844387672220065,"Topic 7":0.17841402605803,"Topic 8":0.008988485252155,"Topic 9":0.757992468116738,"Topic 10":0.00193024260038579},{"id":"10519980075032","body":"Fritz Hollings: Mr. President, ``Exclusion of Social Security from all budgets''--this is the formative statutory law. We have been talking about criminals, while many members of this body commit a crime every time they discuss budget surpluses. They are not obeying their own-- That was Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. We have been struggling a long time, but we cannot get the truth out. We cannot get the truth out. One of the deterrents to the truth is the common belief that every President since Lyndon Johnson has used Social Security trust funds for the general budget. This is not true, Mr. President. It was not so. No, sir. President Lyndon Johnson did not use Social Security in order to balance the budget in 1968-69. I was there. In fact, over on the House side we had the conference. George Mahon was the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. We called over and asked Marvin Watson and said, ``Ask the President if we can cut another $5 billion.'' President Johnson said, ``Cut it,'' and we balanced the budget. President Lyndon Baines Johnson was very conscientious about guns and butter. He was leaving office, and he did not want to leave a heritage of busted budgets and the charge that he had the Great Society and the war in Vietnam and he could not afford them. Mr. President, do you know what the budget was then? It was $178 billion for all purposes of Government, defense and domestic. Do you know what the interest cost on the national debt is? The interest cost on the national debt now is going to be $363 billion, according to this recent report here--a billion dollars a day. Do you know what the interest cost on the national debt was when President Johnson balanced the budget back then? The interest cost was $16 billion. That was interest costs for 200 years of history and the cost of all the wars, up from the Revolution right on through World War I, World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. And it was only a debt that required taxes, interest costs, to be paid of $16 billion. Now we are up there to almost $5.7 trillion without the cost of a war. It has gone right on through the ceiling, a billion a day, $363 billion in interest costs. That is $350 billion more than what we had. And we are spending the money. This is pure waste. Many say government is too big. I agree, it is too big. But the biggest thing in the budget is the interest costs on the national debt. It is bigger than Social Security, bigger than defense, bigger than the domestic budget. We keep spending for nothing. If we had the extra $350 billion since President Johnson's balanced budget--the defense budget is only $250 billion--we could double the defense budget: Instead of 13 aircraft carriers, we will give you 26 aircraft carriers; instead of 16 divisions, we will give you 32 divisions. Double it, and still have $100 billion for research for cancer, NIH, for education, for the environment, for anything--for cleanups, for agriculture. We have the money, because we are spending it on interest payments. Why? Because Congress is not minding the store. It has a wonderful cookie jar it takes from by the billions every year. And over the next 10 years, Congress will continue to steal from it. Over the 5-year period, we are going to have deficits of $557 billion--$557 billion, and we are talking about balancing the budget. Each year, every year, instead of a surplus, there is going to be a balance, and we keep going, going to it.

An issue comes to our attention. It is red hot. It creates a great deal of controversy. Two months later it is forgotten. My effort tonight is going to be to resurrect one of those issues because I think is it not only extremely important, but it is also urgent that we give it attention. The issue is the administration's cost estimate of the Medicare Modernization and Improvement Act and the circumstances surrounding the failure to release that cost estimate to the Congress. As I said, this is old news, but let me just refresh some people's memories. As early as the summer of 2003, the administration's actuaries, the people who work for the administration in the Department of Health and Human Services, projected that the 10-year cost of the Medicare legislation, which among other things provided a prescription drug benefit, would be $534 billion over a 10-year period. It is also old news that Mr. Rick Foster, Chief Actuary of the Medicare Program, was ordered by the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services--at that time Mr. Thomas Scully--to withhold critical actuarial data from Congress and that failure to abide by this order might well result in Mr. Foster being fired. What is yet to be news are the reasons for the months' long delay in disclosing that estimate to the American public and to the Congress. It has now been 10 weeks since we found out the Medicare bill that we had represented to us as costing $400 billion over 10 years would actually cost $534 billion, according to the administration's own actuaries--10 weeks. We have had no explanation for the reasons for the delay, despite the following quote by Secretary Thompson, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, on March 16 of this year. What did the Secretary say? Along with other members of the Finance Committee, I have asked the chairman and the ranking member to hold a hearing on the cost estimate and the reasons for its late disclosure. Given his strong track record on Medicare oversight, I am confident these two fine Senators will do so. I want to be clear about a couple of things: One, it is not the cost per se that is troubling to me. In a moment of full disclosure, I voted for a prescription drug benefit that cost more than $400 billion. I voted for a prescription drug benefit that cost more than $534 billion. But I was voting for a prescription drug benefit that would at least provide a reliable Buick-style benefit to our seniors. What has now happened is we have learned that we passed a Yugo-like prescription drug benefit and are now paying Cadillac prices for it. The second thing I wish to be clear about, some of my colleagues have suggested that the only estimate that matters is the Congressional Budget Office because Congress is legally required to rely on the CBO numbers. You may recall, as a youth, reading some Charles Dickens books, including possibly Oliver Twist. In that book, when confronted with a similar argument, Mr. Bumble said: Mr. Bumble's perspective on the law aside, it is indeed true that Congress uses CBO numbers as our official scorekeeper, and I am not suggesting that at this point we alter that process. At the same time I don't think anyone would disagree that it is in America's best interest and the best interest of Congress to have as much information as possible before we vote on significant pieces of legislation. That would clearly include the insights of the person most knowledgeable about the likely cost of this program--the actuary of the very department that will have the responsibility for administering the program. In fact, it seems information was deliberate, purposefully withheld from the Congress. That action of withholding was contrary to past practices. Moreover, it appears to directly violate the spirit of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 which confirmed the independence of the Chief Actuary and the desire of Congress to have access to his relevant cost projections. The fact that the official cost has appropriately been determined by CBO is not the point, nor is the point the fact that there was a difference in the cost estimates between the Congressional Budget Office and the Department's actuaries. We know that different analysts will frequently arrive at different conclusions. The point is this: the enormous magnitude of the difference and the efforts apparently taken by this administration to keep that huge difference hidden from public and congressional scrutiny. That is the point. The point is the Chief Actuary had information that would have been valuable to us, Republicans and Democrats alike, in our deliberations long before we took our vote on the final conferenced version of the Medicare prescription drug legislation. This information was deliberately withheld. The fact is, if the White House had released to the public and the Congress its own actuary's estimate of the cost of this Yugo prescription drug benefit, the legislation would clearly not have passed. The Finance Committee has a particular obligation to investigate this deception. As a member of that committee, I understand we have an obligation to seniors who are depending on an affordable, quality prescription drug benefit. We have an obligation to taxpayers who will be paying for that benefit. We have an obligation to our fellow colleagues to whom we declared, we represented that this plan would not cost more than $400 billion, cross my heart and hope to die. We have an obligation to get answers to these questions: What did the President know regarding the much higher cost estimated by his own actuaries and when did he know it? For someone from Tennessee, that might be a familiar question. If the President did not know that one of his stated priorities was estimated by his actuaries to far exceed the cost ceiling for this Medicare change--$400 billion over 10 years--who within his administration failed to notify him of this extraordinary cost overrun? Third, what actions, if any, were taken by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Office of Management and Budget, or the White House itself to prevent the timely and accurate reporting of information to Congress on the cost of this Medicare bill? Finally, who has the President held accountable for this deception and what sanctions have been imposed? These are ``rational, critical, important to the Congress and the public to know the answers'' questions. One of the immediate impacts we are going to have because of this withholding is that the Congress, the Senate, now the House, have recently passed budget resolutions. These budget resolutions cover fiscal year 2005, which begins October 1 of this year, running through fiscal year 2009. In that budget resolution, as passed by the Senate, the baseline cost of the new Medicare prescription drug provisions and other matters that were included in that legislation is $165 billion over 5 years. The number, as determined by the administration's own Office of the Actuary in the Department of Health and Human Services, is $231 billion. Mr. President, what are we going to do when we face the question of funding this prescription drug benefit--what I suspect to be likely closer to its true cost, $231 billion, as opposed to $165 billion, CBO's number. Are we going to have to have a point of order with 60 votes every time we exceed the clearly inadequate number in order to provide the benefit that we are now running millions of dollars worth of television ads telling the seniors of America they are about to get a new benefit, without any changes in the Medicare Program? The Finance Committee needs to closely examine these different numbers. I suggest a couple of places to start. Approximately 25 percent of the difference between CBO and the actuaries is in one area, and that is what will be the effect of increasing the number of persons who are enrolled in health management organizations. This legislation not only dealt with prescription drugs, but it also substantially increased the funding for HMOs and insurance companies in order to create an atmosphere that would induce new Medicare beneficiaries to change their form of service from fee for service to traditional Medicare and to join an HMO. In fact, the CBO estimated it would cost an additional $14 billion to do that. The administration estimates it will cost $46 billion. You might ask why does it cost more. I thought the purpose of using an HMO for Medicare beneficiaries was it would save money. It was supposed to get people into a more organized health care system; it was supposed to encourage HMOs to provide preventive services so people would not get as sick, and they would have a higher quality of life and less health care costs. Well, I am shocked, and I am certain most Members of Congress are shocked, to find the administration finds it will cost $46 billion more to provide health care services to those persons who are induced by the benefits of this legislation to join an HMO than if they stayed where they were. So one question we need to know is, why are we scaring seniors into HMOs, when this is clearly harmful to the financial structure of the Medicare Program? The second point I hope the Finance Committee will review is the prohibition inserted into this legislation against the administrator of the program and the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, negotiating on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries to get the best possible prices for prescription drugs. We have an almost analogous situation, except the circumstances are reversed. The Secretary of the Veterans' Administration is directed to negotiate for the prescription drugs his largest hospital system in the world provides. Guess what. He has negotiated so well the cost of prescription drugs in a VA hospital is less than half of what it would be if you bought the same drugs at retail at a local dru","word.count":2086,"sep11":2.6376404494382,"years":2004.49719101124,"days":3381,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.468670277703374,"Topic 2":0.0931287051658822,"Topic 3":0.0236318480531884,"Topic 4":0.0515462564323027,"Topic 5":0.0177934029324479,"Topic 6":0.197437434733816,"Topic 7":0.0151211105299424,"Topic 8":0.0929066449485749,"Topic 9":0.0229116899775669,"Topic 10":0.0168526295229054},{"id":"10419950054736","body":"David E. Skaggs: That is the point that I would like to get across to our listeners and viewers--that it is easy to be critical. It is easy to say, ``oh, no. Do not fool with that CPI, that Consumer Price Index, and the Medicare figure is too high. We do not like what you have done on welfare. The Republican Governors do not like what you have done totally on welfare an area that has been mentioned before briefly. We make some savings out of Medicare, or actually what we do is we reduce the rate of growth over the next 7 years. Medicare, unless something is done, is truly going to go broke. People say, ``Oh, we have heard you people say that around here on this floor before.'' All right, let us just look and see what has happened. We have two recent reports. The New York Times reported last Tuesday that the Medicare hospital insurance trust fund--which is the fund that pays the hospital bills for the elderly--operated at a loss for the first 6 months of this current fiscal year. It fell short, the outflow as compared to the income, fell $4 billion short in that brief time. So once upon a time we were bringing in more revenue than we were expending and we built up a surplus. Now the lines on the graph have crossed and the expenditures are exceeding the income. That is not going to change unless we do some things. Yesterday's Washington Post reported the Congressional Budget Office now believes the Medicare trust fund will become insolvent in the year 2001. When we started on this exercise just a few months ago we thought it was going to go insolvent in 2002, so in just a few months we have seen the fiscal situation of the trust fund deteriorate by a year. So, unless something is done in this Medicare Program, along the lines that we have suggested, the Medicare trust fund, which pays the hospital costs of the elderly in this Nation, is going to go broke. That is something we ought to take very, very seriously. I read a comment the other day in the newspaper where somebody said, ``Oh, don't believe that. We are going to take care of it.'' It is not easy to take care of some of these situations once the downward spiral starts and the expenses exceed the income. Once that starts there is really serious trouble ahead. I would like to now touch briefly on the Consumer Price Index. The Consumer Price Index has clearly been overstated. What we do, as the Senator from Louisiana pointed out, in our group, we say let us state the Consumer Price Index accurately. So that is what we have done. That results, fortunately, in dramatic savings, not just over this 7-year period, but for the outyears as well. So, a key part of our proposal here is the recognition of the fact that the Consumer Price Index is overstated. We hope our fellow Senators, paying attention, listening and studying this situation, will come to the conclusion that we have, that it is essential to state the Consumer Price Index in an accurate form.

President Gerald Ford, along with the Congress, adopted the legislation which created the act to deal with students with disabilities. Senator Jeffords has been a champion on this issue for 30 years. I am so pleased to be joining with him in this effort once again. I regret it has taken us this long. We have had some great successes in the past. As I mentioned earlier, less than 2 years ago we voted unanimously to send a message that we cared about this issue. In fact, we adopted a larger sum of money than what we are asking for today. The amendment Senator Jeffords offered, along with Senator Harkin and Senator Hagel, was for $2.5 billion. We are talking about $2.2 billion, when you add the $1.2 billion that is in the bill. It is less than what we asked for 2 years ago to get us on a road to meeting the full 40 percent funding commitment we made 30 years ago. I thank the Senator from Vermont once again for his tireless efforts on behalf of America's children, their families, and taxpayers. I know others want to be heard on this matter. I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a listing of all the increases, to print what this $1.2 billion will mean State by State. I know the Presiding Officer, my good friend, will be curious to know how Idaho would do. Idaho will get an additional $6 million under this program if we get these additional dollars for special education funds. I am quickly looking down the list because I do not want to leave out my colleague from Oregon. An additional $14 million will go to his communities to defray the cost of special needs children. I include what this amount means to each State so my colleagues can have some idea as to how they will benefit.

We have not had one single minute of debate in the Committee on the Budget on a budget for this country and not a single minute out here on the budget, but we have 2 hours on this issue, which is basically a matter of science. Now, there is very clear and convincing evidence that this is a matter of saving lives through a program that some people want to make it, people are either for needle exchange and therefore they are soft on drugs or people are against needle exchange and they are strong against drugs. There could not be anything further from the truth. The fact is, these programs have been used in the Northwest. They have reduced the infection rate from 30 percent in New York and the South to 3 percent in the Northwest among HIV-infected people. Now people say it encourages drug use. The Secretary of HHS, Donna Shalala, convened a panel of experts at the National Institutes of Health. They came back with the fact that needle exchange programs do not increase and, in fact, may decrease the use of drugs. The fact is, if we just want to be money-wise, one case of prevented HIV infection is estimated to save $119,000. Now how do these programs work? In Tacoma and Seattle, they have a table where somebody sits and somebody has to bring a needle and they get a clean needle. Now I do not know how that is going to encourage the use of drugs. Are my colleagues suggesting that high school kids are going to come and say, well, I got a needle; give me a clean one so I can go find some drugs to use? We are talking about a population that is infecting 33 people per day in this country with HIV, and 85 percent of the new cases in this country are among heterosexual people, and 66 percent of the cases among women are linked to drug use. Every single case of a child today being infected by HIV is linked to drugs and drug usage. Now if my colleagues want to prevent those cases, if they are worried about kids, if they are worried about women getting the disease, then they want to have the needle exchange program. It has worked in the Northwest for a bill like the one that the gentleman from New York has put out here on the floor that has a broad, sweeping nature to it. Any direct or indirect; does that mean that Seattle and Tacoma cannot have their program? Do we have to continue a program or discontinue a program because of that? I say that is wrong.

Nethercutt: Mr. Speaker, National Gambling Impact and Policy Commission Act would create a national commission to study the economic and social impact of gambling in our country. The legislation is the concept of our colleague, and my good friend, Congressman Frank Wolf of Virginia. This measure is on the floor of the House largely because of his articulate advocacy and persistence. A study of the impact of gambling on our society--focusing on both its positive and negative aspects--will be a helpful tool for policymakers at the Federal, State, and local government levels. Frank Wolf has identified a very important public policy issue and he deserves high praise for his efforts. On September 29, 1995, the full Judiciary Committee held a hearing on H.R. 497. At that time, we heard from 15 witnesses, including 8 Members of Congress. Also, subsequent to our hearing, the committee received 15 additional statements for the record from other interested organizations and individuals. During our hearing, we heard virtually every point of view on gambling and its effects. For example, we had testimony on the problem of compulsive gambling. We also heard from a university professor focusing on the economic aspects of gambling--that is, job creation, impact on tourism, State and local government revenue, et cetera. We also heard testimony from the chairman of the National Indian Gaming Association, documenting how the emergence of an Indian gambling industry in recent years has had a positive impact on employment, economic development, and overall self-sufficiency for Indian tribes. Still others testified regarding the relationship between gambling and crime, including organized crime. Based upon this extensive committee record and personal study, I concluded that a study commission on gambling in the United States is a good idea. As the Washington Post proclaimed in its headline for an editorial endorsing the bill: ``For Once, a Useful Commission!'' The Post went on to observe that ``commissions can * * * play the useful role of bringing to national attention issues that were previously submerged or debated in fragmentary ways.'' In my view, it is particularly timely for us to have a balanced, impartial, and comprehensive look at whether or not the spread of gambling is good for this country. Over the last two decades, legalized gambling has expanded extensively throughout our country. Currently, 48 States allow some form of legalized gambling. We have State-conducted lotteries, riverboat gambling, Indian gambling, and casino gambling. For better or worse, gambling has become a commonplace part of the American culture. Just this week, the Washington Post illustrated the explosive growth of gambling: The Washington Post, March 3, 1996 at A1. Many believe that this widespread expansion of legalized gambling has had numerous negative effects. In some instances, this conclusion is undoubtedly true. For example, many opportunities to gamble are now available to minors who are not ready to make a mature judgment about the nature of this kind of activity. Furthermore, compulsive gamblers frequently have a negative, sometimes tragic, impact on their families. The traditional linkage between gambling and crime is also an obvious concern. To give just one example, a GAO report issued in January concluded that ``the proliferation of casinos, together with the rapid growth of the amounts wagered, may make these operations highly vulnerable to money laundering.'' General Accounting Office, ``Money Laundering--Rapid Growth of Casinos Makes Them Vulnerable,'' GAO/GGD- 96-28, B-259791 at 2. As gambling continues to spread, these negative effects and others spread with it. In addition, the proponents of H.R. 497 have pointed out the lack of reliable information about the actual effects of gambling. We simply need better and more accurate scientific and behavioral data concerning gambling. Because of this lack of information, State and local policymakers, who are considering the legalization of gambling in various forms, are often vulnerable to exaggerated claims about the positive effects of gambling and the prospects for painless revenue generation. Just 3 months ago, a Maryland State study commission concluded: Final Report of the Joint Executive-Legislative Task Force to Study Commercial Gaming Activities in Maryland, December 1995, at xiv . I also want to stress that I have listened to the critics of H.R. 497 as introduced, and they too have some valid points to make. In particular, they said that they do not fear the outcome of an objective study. However, they did express concern that the Commission as proposed in the original version of H.R. 497 might be biased against gambling per se and that it was only charged with looking at the negative effects of gambling. I believe that this Commission can do the most good if its study is as neutral, objective, and comprehensive as possible--considering the views of all sides of this issue. In that spirit, I proposed a committee amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 497, which the Judiciary Committee adopted on a voice vote. My substitute included the vast majority of the provisions contained in H.R. 497 as originally introduced, but it added language so as to assure that all points of view would be represented on the Commission. Specifically, the bill now requires that the appointing authorities consult together to ensure that the overall makeup of the Commission fairly and equitably represent various points of view. It also drops the requirement that one seat on the Commission go to a State Governor. I want to avoid going down the difficult road of specifying which group gets what seat on the Commission because I believe that is a decision better left to the collective wisdom of the appointing authorities--the President, the Speaker, and the majority leader of the other body. In addition, the amendments add language that would require the Commission to study both the positive and negative aspects of the economic impact of gambling. I believe that the opponents of H.R. 497 will agree that these changes are a good-faith effort to address their concerns about the fairness and balance of the Commission. At the Judiciary Committee hearing, I heard members of the committee express particular concern about the issue of advertising concerning gambling activities. Because of that concern, the amendment adds language that would require the Commission to study that issue. At the suggestion of our colleague, Congressman Hoke, we added even further specificity to the advertising language, and I appreciate his contribution and his willingness to work with us on this issue. Senator Dick Lugar, as well as the Governor of my own State of Illinois, Gov. Jim Edgar, raised the issue of gambling through the Internet and other interactive technologies. The amendment adds language directing the Commission to look at this aspect of the issue. We have also added language that will require the Commission to study the impact of revenue from State-sponsored gambling on State budgets. With respect to all of these changes, my thinking is that the more comprehensive the Commission's study is, the more useful it will be. Another major change the amendment would make is to shorten the time period for the study commission from 3 to 2 years. The Maryland study commission urged that we make the time period even shorter. This will reduce the costs involved with this effort. The amendment also made changes of a technical and conforming nature. During committee consideration of this bill, Congressman Bono, Congressman Schiff, and Congressman Gallegly expressed concerns about whether the proposed Commission would end up being overly biased against gambling operations in general, and Indian gambling operations, in particular. I worked with these members to craft language to amend H.R. 497 to address these concerns. These changes include: First, language to clarify that the Commission is to study all forms of commercial gambling include State lotteries, casino gambling, pari- mutuel betting, and sports betting; second, language that clarifies that the study of political contributions should include all political contributions that influence public policy on gambling, not just those of gambling operators; and third, language originally suggested by Congressman Frank that would require the Commission to study the extend to which casino gambling has provided economic opportunity for Indians and residents of economically depressed areas. I also agreed to add language to the report that further addresses their concerns about the fairness of the makeup of the Commission. Subsequent to our consideration of the bill, the Resources Committee sought and received sequential referral of the bill to review specifically its effect on Indian gambling. After its consideration, that committee made a suggestion of one amendment that would clarify the bill's description of the gambling regulatory policies to be studied so that it now includes tribal regulatory policy. I have accepted that amendment, and it is part of the substitute text we consider today. I want to thank Chairman Don Young for his cooperation in this matter. I also want to note that by cooperating with the Resources Committee, the Judiciary Committee does not waive any of its traditional jurisdiction over Federal gambling statutes and gambling issues generally. I think all of these changes make the bill more balanced and comprehensive, and I appreciate the contributions of all of these members in working with us to make this a better bill. I have discussed the various changes contained in my substitute amendment, as well as the Resources Committee amendment, with Congressman Wolf, and he has indicated his full support for all of these changes. I urge my colleagues to adopt the improvements embodied in the committee amendment and to pass H.R. 497 as amended.

Matsui: Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume H. Res. 1253 provides a structured rule for consideration of H.R. 6003, the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008. The resolution provides 1 hour of general debate controlled by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and makes in order 8 of the 10 amendments submitted for consideration. From coast to coast we are seeing the effects of rising fuel prices. Energy prices have been a regular topic here in Congress, in the newspapers, and at family dinner tables. The average price of a gallon of gas in Sacramento just climbed to $4.41. My constituents are feeling this burden every single day. Driving to work and school is becoming more difficult and more costly for everyone. The City of Sacramento also just started a major construction project on I-5, which cuts through the heart of my district. The already congested streets are going to become even more crowded. That is why I am glad we are here considering such an important bill to reauthorize and invest in Amtrak. Our constituents are in desperate need of alternative modes of travel to combat both increased congestion as well as rising gas prices. Now is the time to capitalize on the renewed interest in passenger rail. Millions of Americans from Atlanta to Sacramento are getting out of their cars and onto public transit. Many of these riders will be getting on rail for the first time. We must not let the opportunity to invest in our rail system pass us by. From Greece to Paris to Tokyo, we have seen the economic benefits of intercity rail. Let's now bring these benefits to our Nation, our States, and our hometowns. The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act takes great strides to improve Amtrak and give our constituents the flexibility they need to travel. Amtrak was created in 1970 to preserve and reinvigorate intercity passenger rail service throughout the country. Since 1981, it has been the Nation's sole provider of regularly scheduled intercity passenger rail service. In fiscal year 2007, Amtrak carried more than 25.8 million passengers, the fifth straight fiscal year of record ridership. Increased ridership numbers occurred across all of Amtrak's services in both corridor and long-distance routes. On average, more than 70,000 passengers ride on Amtrak every day. Amtrak's financial performance has also improved in recent years, posting record gains in ticket sales. My region has seen the positive effects and benefits of having efficient transportation options. The Capitol Corridor line in California is showing that record numbers of Californians are choosing to use passenger rail. Ridership on the Capitol Corridor line is up 14 percent and revenue is up 21 percent from last year. On-time performance was also up from last year. We can all agree that Amtrak needs to be brought into the 21st century. This legislation provides a comprehensive framework to improve Amtrak across the country. It increases capital and operating grants to Amtrak, helps bring the Northeast Corridor to a state of good repair, and makes various capital improvements. H.R. 6003 also creates a new grant program for intercity passenger rail capital projects. Our urban centers will see tangible benefits and a commitment to getting cars off the streets by promoting alternative and efficient modes of transportation. H.R. 6003 takes great strides to relieve rail congestion. It provides important congestion grants and works to resolve disputes between commuter and freight railroads. It also provides significant funding for high-speed rail corridors, including $1.75 billion for construction and equipment. Simply put, this bill will reduce congestion and facilitate ridership growth. I want to thank Chairman Oberstar and Ranking Member Mica for coming together on this important bipartisan legislation. I am proud that this Congress is taking this important issue and tackling it, and look forward to supporting this legislation. Madam Speaker, passage of the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act is an important step to demonstrating our commitment to infrastructure investment. This is long overdue, and I encourage everyone to support the rule and the underlying legislation to provide the country with a safe and alternative mode of travel. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.","word.count":700,"sep11":6.92134831460674,"years":2008.7808988764,"days":4906,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0165041155619068,"Topic 2":0.16315255884679,"Topic 3":0.0588260802411022,"Topic 4":0.0250739213153214,"Topic 5":0.0134430450590867,"Topic 6":0.0299610644954639,"Topic 7":0.00628473598732544,"Topic 8":0.0278969631659655,"Topic 9":0.0718820181957004,"Topic 10":0.586975497131337},{"id":"11020070094741","body":"Robert F. Bennett: Mr. President, last week a group of us, both Senators and Members of the House, Republicans and Democrats, had the opportunity to sit down with Frederick Kagan, who is a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, and listen to his comments about where we are with respect to Iraq. At the end of that very illuminating session, he gave us each a copy of a new report that he has authored called ``No Middle Way, The Challenge of Exit Strategies from Iraq.'' The report is too long for me to ask consent that it be printed in the Record, but I recommend it to all my colleagues. It is one of the most thorough and thoughtful examinations of where we are in Iraq I have seen. I will be quoting from it, but I wish to make a few observations about the situation in Iraq before I do. The Iraq debate seems to be mired down in arguments about past decisions and whether they were right. These kinds of arguments are useful, and they are particularly useful in the hands of historians who are reviewing an entire situation from a vantage point of years afterward, but they are not necessarily that valuable as we are addressing the question of what do we do now. If I can play the historian for a moment and give examples of how we have entered into conflicts and seen the situation on the ground change and, therefore, strategies change, let me go back to the Revolutionary War. At the time of the Revolutionary War, the original strategies the Commander in Chief, George Washington, applied didn't work. Indeed, the Continental Army was defeated again and again and again by the British troops, and Washington was forced to acknowledge that his original strategic decisions were the wrong ones. This did not mean we lost the war because Washington adjusted to the conditions on the ground, adopted new strategies, and ended up winning the war. In the Civil War, when Abraham Lincoln made the decision to provision Fort Sumter, he did not understand how long the war would last, how difficult it would be, how much life and treasure it would claim. He was forced to change again and again in reaction to the results that came from the battlefield. In Iraq, we made some decisions based on intelligence at the time which have proved to be wrong. Spending our time in this Chamber arguing over those decisions instead of recognizing how conditions have changed on the ground becomes a self-defeating exercise. As I look at the decisions that were made prior to the decision to go into Iraq, the one that strikes me as being the most significant was our failure to understand the degree to which Saddam Hussein had destroyed that country, not just physically, not just in terms of its infrastructure but psychologically. We believed there were Iraqis who could step forward and lead a resurgence of that country if we simply freed them from the heavy hand of Saddam Hussein. That was a false belief. We found Iraqis so shattered by 37 years of one of the most brutal dictatorships we have ever seen that the leadership vacuum was huge. For us now to spend our time saying, well, we made the mistake, therefore we have to cure the mistake by getting out, is to ignore the conditions on the ground that have evolved as a result of getting into the war in the first place. Mr. Kagan makes the point that there is no middle way. We are trying to find a middle way in these Chambers. There are those who say the only way is to withdraw immediately, and there are others who say, no, the only way is to stay the course. That phrase has been hackneyed; it doesn't work anymore. So it is natural for many of us to say: Let's find some middle way. Let's stay in there somewhat, but let's eliminate a good portion of the American footprint in Iraq and see if that doesn't help us get out without absolute withdrawal. Mr. Kagan makes the point that the conditions on the ground rule out such a middle way. I find his arguments persuasive, and I would like to share some of them with my colleagues today. He looks not at the question of did Saddam Hussein have anything to do with 9/11, a question we hear debated a great deal. He says: Is al- Qaida engaged now in Iraq? The answer is overwhelmingly yes. Whether al-Qaida and Saddam Hussein had any ties prior to our invasion in Iraq is now irrelevant. Al-Qaida is in Iraq. Al-Qaida is a major player in Iraq. There are those who say Iran is the major threat, and we should be looking at Iran. He points out that Iran is very much involved in Iraq at the present time. These are the conditions on the ground. We are not debating 9/11. We are not debating the U.N. resolutions. We are debating conditions on the ground that very much involve both al-Qaida and Iran. So those are the conditions to which we need to pay attention. If I may quote from Mr. Kagan's report, he says: That is a very interesting thing to contemplate as you look ahead-- Iran expanding its power in the region, making some kind of accommodation with the Saudis and the other Gulf States in order to consolidate its power. Is that something America wants to look forward to? He goes on: We are having a great debate about what to do about Iran. We are showing great concern about the possibility of Iran getting a nuclear weapon. The new President of France, Mr. Sarkozy, has talked about the unacceptability of Iran having a nuclear weapon, even to the point of suggesting that military options should be on the table. Military options with respect to an Iranian nuclear weapon, if it comes to that, will undoubtedly involve more American troops and more American treasure than are currently at stake in Iraq. In the conclusion section of Mr. Kagan's report, he says: The report he discusses in the group that tries to find a middle way-- Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 2 minutes.","word.count":1048,"sep11":6.21629213483146,"years":2008.07584269663,"days":4655,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.205727775188525,"Topic 2":0.276207504842158,"Topic 3":0.032518010992913,"Topic 4":0.18390479428951,"Topic 5":0.141008928492312,"Topic 6":0.00932901265121235,"Topic 7":0.0947059170264078,"Topic 8":0.0278446415200517,"Topic 9":0.0203406773640937,"Topic 10":0.00841273763281731},{"id":"10620000006517","body":"Nancy Pelosi: Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Michigan , the ranking member, for yielding me this time.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution, a measure I introduced earlier this year to honor the life and legacy of Chief Standing Bear. His plea for justice and human decency challenged the heart of our Nation, yet his poignant story as one of America's earliest civil rights leaders remains largely unknown. 2008 is the 100th anniversary of Chief Standing Bear's death. It is fitting that we honor this anniversary, that generations of Americans will know his life and his legacy. Standing Bear was born in the Niobrara River Valley, in what is now Nebraska, in 1834. An individual of exceptional talent and ability, he became chief of the Ponca Tribe at a young age. In 1877, the Ponca people were forced by treaty to relocate from their home in Nebraska to the Indian territory of Oklahoma. The hardship of this 500-mile journey on foot, illnesses, as well as the harsh living conditions in Oklahoma, caused the death of many members of the tribe, including Chief Standing Bear's son. Committed to a promise he made to his son to return him to their Niobrara homeland for burial, Chief Standing Bear left for Nebraska with all who would follow him. Upon their return, the Chief and 30 of his fellow Ponca Tribe members were arrested by the Department of Interior in Omaha. With the assistance of Omaha attorneys, John Webster and A.J. Poppleton, and frontier newsman, Thomas Tibbles, who worked for the predecessor to our current newspaper in Omaha, the Omaha World-Herald, Chief Standing Bear petitioned the Federal courts for relief from the unjust Federal treatment of the Ponca Tribe. In 1879, the case came before U.S. District Court Judge Elmer Dundy. At the conclusion of his testimony, Chief Standing Bear raised his hand and he spoke these words: ``That hand is not the color of yours,'' he said. ``But if I pierce it, I shall feel pain. If you pierce your hand, you will also feel pain. The blood that will flow from mine will be the same color as yours. I am a man. God made us both.'' The wisdom and dignity in Standing Bear's words were not lost on Judge Dundy who ruled that Native Americans are, in fact, citizens endowed with all of the rights and all of the freedoms guaranteed by the United States Constitution. Through the steadfast efforts of Chief Standing Bear and caring Nebraskans, the Ponca won their freedom and the right to return to their Nebraska homeland on the Niobrara where Chief Standing Bear declared, ``Here we will live, and here we will die.'' Chief Standing Bear would spend the next 4 years touring the United States advocating for Native Americans' civil rights and inspiring a generation. Then he returned to his home near the mouth of Niobrara, farmed his land, and died there a quarter century later in 1908. Mr. Speaker, the courage and determination of Chief Standing Bear have earned him a place in our civil rights history. His example is an inspiration for all those engaged in the advancement of civil rights, of human rights. I want to thank all of my colleagues in the House who have been supportive of bringing this resolution to the floor so that we can rightly honor this great man, Chief Standing Bear.","word.count":589,"sep11":6.80337078651685,"years":2008.66292134831,"days":4864,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.114904448202968,"Topic 2":0.111421598356915,"Topic 3":0.290199841882391,"Topic 4":0.0365914541042376,"Topic 5":0.0373080451662948,"Topic 6":0.0825368749762461,"Topic 7":0.00658739855497519,"Topic 8":0.0617489996155399,"Topic 9":0.249296937425182,"Topic 10":0.00940440171525049},{"id":"11020080024245","body":"Nick Lampson: Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume I rise today to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, whose many outstanding achievements have provided many immeasurable benefits for the United States and the world. It was 50 years ago this month, specifically July 29, that President Eisenhower signed the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 that established NASA. At that time, the American public was still reeling from the impact of the Soviet Union's successful launch of Sputnik 1 in late 1957 which led to the space race with the Soviets. That race came to an end less than 12 years later when American astronauts successfully landed on the Moon and returned safely to Earth. NASA was the agency that led the effort to create a human space flight program from scratch and make America preeminent in space. Yet as remarkable as NASA's achievements were in getting America to the Moon as well as to building the Shuttle and Skylab and the International Space Station, NASA has excelled in many other areas. NASA's aeronautics research and development activities over the past half century have led to significant advances in both civil and military aircraft. NASA's aeronautics programs have also helped to make America's aviation system a world leader in safety and have improved our quality of life in numerous ways. In addition to human space flight and aeronautics, NASA has created space and Earth science programs that are second to none in the world in terms of advancing knowledge of our planet and of our universe. One only has to look at the ways in which the Hubble telescope, for example, has rewritten the astronomy textbook since its launch in 1990 to know that NASA's space-based science programs are really some of the Nation's premier research endeavors. In addition, NASA's technology developments have rippled through our economy in countless ways, delivering new materials, new processes, and new systems that have had a major impact on things as diverse as health care and weather forecasting. And finally, NASA continues to be a source of inspiration to our young people and a symbol to the world of America's technological and scientific preeminence. These are important realities that we should not overlook when we debate funding for NASA. Mr. Speaker, investing in NASA has been and continues to be an investment in our future.

I would have hoped that after last year we could have come to the table of compromise on the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education appropriations bill, but we find that this department is underfunded some $6.15 billion below the President's request. What strikes me the most is that we have given up on children by underfunding Head Start by $38.1 million, which serves only 740,000 out of the two million children who are currently eligible for this important and effective early childhood program. Just a couple of weeks ago I had the opportunity to be in California discussing the crisis of juvenile crime all over the Nation, and one thing that we were assured of or convinced of, as the RAND study has indicated, that it is the upfront cost that will allow us to invest in Americans and prevent the incarceration of citizens in their later life. I cannot understand my Republican colleagues for striking out Head Start once more and disallowing the numbers of children that need this service to not be served. Additionally, I cannot understand if this is a Nation of working people, supporting working Americans, that we would cut the dollars that promotes workplace safety and health and also pensions security. Just yesterday, in a very grateful manner, the Senate voted overwhelmingly to support the increase in the minimum wage. We now in the House of Representatives will be dealing with a bill that says to the American workers that they are out. We strike them out on workplace safety, we strike them out in health care and we strike them out in pension security. We have worked over the last 2 years to ensure that our young people have an appreciation for work. The Youth Summer Jobs Program has been one that I have personally taken charge to see that we respect the fact that young people care about work. We cut it in 1995, they cut it in fiscal year 1996, but yet we were able to see that it survived. Here we go again, we are now at 442,000 youth who cannot be served because of the cuts in the Youth Summer Jobs Program. I think it is important that we recognize that America is a country of inclusiveness. I would say that, in addition to including our youth, we should recognize those who suffer from mental illness and drug abuse. The bill provides less funding for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. The amount, $1.85 billion, is an aggregated cut of $33.9 million below the current funding level and is $248 million below the administration's request. Just for a moment, one of the things I have heard often when I have spoken to my health care providers in Texas is that mental health is an important issue. I think if we defeat this rule we will be able to support youth, children, and those who suffer from mental illness and substance abuse. I ask my colleagues to defeat the rule.","word.count":527,"sep11":-5.3061797752809,"years":1996.55337078652,"days":553,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.125491392234019,"Topic 2":0.0098413964813031,"Topic 3":0.119634615691017,"Topic 4":0.0991681911857495,"Topic 5":0.0809962874347688,"Topic 6":0.00452929885270446,"Topic 7":0.00159811574815248,"Topic 8":0.243363822969203,"Topic 9":0.00264917968813673,"Topic 10":0.312727699714945},{"id":"10619990072470","body":"Jon Kyl: I realize the leader, as Senator Reid said, has a lot of burdens.

I strongly support the Senate quickly passing H.R. 1552 to extend the Internet tax moratorium for 2 years. Last month, I was pleased to join the senior Senator from Oregon and the senior Senator from Arizona as an original cosponsor of the Internet Tax Moratorium Extension Act, the Senate counterpart to H.R. 1552. I commend Senator Wyden and Senator McCain for their continued leadership on Internet tax policy. Although electronic commerce is beginning to blossom, it is still in its infancy. Stability is key to reaching its full potential, and creating new tax categories for the Internet is exactly the wrong thing to do. E-commerce should not be subject to new taxes that do not apply to other commerce. Indeed, without the current moratorium, there are 30,000 different jurisdictions around the country that could levy discriminatory or multiple Internet taxes on e-commerce. Let's not allow the future of electronic commerce, with its great potential to expand the markets of Main Street businesses, to be crushed by the weight of discriminatory taxation. Many Vermont companies have contacted me in the last month and weeks in support of extending the moratorium, including Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, the Army &amp; Navy Store in Barre, and the Vermont Teddy Bear Company. Cyberselling is working for Vermonters. We also need a national policy to make sure that the traditional State and local sales taxes on Internet sales are applied and collected fairly and uniformly. This 2-year extension of the current moratorium gives our Governors and State legislatures time to simplify their sales tax rules and reach consensus on a workable national system for collecting sales taxes on e-commerce. Indeed, the National Conference of State Legislatures has endorsed our legislation to extend the Internet tax moratorium for two more years to give States time to complete work on sales tax simplification. I must also raise some serious questions about the approach of some Senators to pass legislation to waive Congress's authority to carefully review and approve interstate compacts. As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over interstate compacts, I cannot understand why we should recede congressional authority to approve an interstate compact on sales tax issues if 20 States join any compact. Despite good intentions of its proponents, this approach is asking the Senate to buy a pig in a poke. I am a strong supporter of interstate compacts where appropriate, such as the Northeast Dairy Compact, but the Senate should not approve of any interstate compact without carefully reviewing its details first. When the Northeast Dairy Compact was approved by the Congress, every detail and every aspect of it was known far in advance. It also raises constitutional questions for legislation to mandate that Congress automatically approve an interstate compact on sales taxes without reviewing its text since the Constitution explicitly requires Congress to approve interstate compacts. The Enzi amendment allows 11 jurisdictions to continue to tax Internet access, but permanently bans Internet access taxes everywhere else in the country. By permanently prohibiting taxation of Internet access in some States, but approving of such taxation in other States, the Enzi amendment may violate the ``uniformity clause'' in Article I, 8 of the United States Constitution. The uniformity clause states that ``all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States.'' The uniformity clause requires that Federal legislation levying taxes follow a consistent plan and apply in all portions of the United States where the subject of the tax is found. In United States v. Ptasynski, the Supreme Court held that it will subject geographic distinctions in Federal taxation to heightened scrutiny. In a unanimous decision, the Court stated that ``Where Congress does choose to frame a tax in geographic terms, we will examine the classification closely to see if there is actual geographic discrimination.'' The Enzi amendment proposal to lock in discrimination between States in taxation of Internet access raises questions under the uniformity clause that require careful consideration. In the case of a temporary moratorium, such as the one in the House bill, the grandfathering of Internet access taxes in a limited number of States may be explained as freezing the status quo while Congress comes up with a permanent solution to the Internet tax issue. Thus, it is unlikely to raise the geographic discrimination problem the Supreme Court discussed in Ptasynski, and would survive heightened scrutiny. In contrast, the Enzi amendment's permanent discrimination on the basis of where an Internet user lives is much harder to explain under the heightened scrutiny required by the Supreme Court. If courts treat the Federal Government's establishment of a discriminatory regime of taxation by the States as raising the same uniformity clause issues as the Federal Government's levying of discriminatory taxes, the Enzi amendment's Internet access tax moratorium will be ruled unconstitutional. As a result, this amendment appears to raise serious constitutional concerns. E-Commerce is growing, our moratorium law is working, and we should keep a good thing going. I am proud to cosponsor the Internet Tax Moratorium Extension Act to encourage online commerce to continue to grow with confidence and to continue to allow the States to move ahead with sales tax simplification efforts. I urge my colleagues to vote for a straight forward 2-year extension of the internet tax moratorium.","word.count":904,"sep11":0.182584269662921,"years":2002.04213483146,"days":2507,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0172859753047142,"Topic 2":0.131064997114448,"Topic 3":0.00534925652870531,"Topic 4":0.563811144997472,"Topic 5":0.0471337493818597,"Topic 6":0.00187601347164422,"Topic 7":0.0259363081883945,"Topic 8":0.00993808555999727,"Topic 9":0.149573911427262,"Topic 10":0.0480305580255027},{"id":"10519980018353","body":"Merrill Cook: Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3824, the Fastener Quality Act amendments. Mr. Speaker, as a freshman Congressman one of my overriding desires is to cut government waste, duplication of effort, and bureaucracy, which is exactly what this bill does. H.R. 3824 ensures that America's manufacturing economy and American consumers are not harmed by outdated or unnecessary regulations. The bill will help business be more competitive with foreign manufacturers while keeping safety standards for consumers that we have come to expect. The Fastener Quality Act was intended to make structures more safe and it was a good idea. Unfortunately, it set up two government bureaucracies with the same regulation to oversee manufacturing of nuts, bolts, studs and screws. For example, aviation manufacturers are already subject to the Federal quality assurance programs of the Federal Aviation Administration and, therefore, the fasteners they manufacture already meet or exceed the quality standards of the Fastener Quality Act. Requiring another government agency other than the FAA to certify aviation industry nuts, bolts, studs, and screws would be a waste of taxpayers' dollars. It would create an enormous duplication of effort and would create significantly higher airline ticket prices. In the motor vehicle industry, the safety of fasteners is assured and monitored by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration in compliance with the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act. Auto manufacturers already have ample incentive and regulation to use the highest quality fasteners possible. The auto industry has concluded that the annual cost of duplicative regulations would be $317 million, which would be directly passed on to consumers, yet automobiles would be no safer because current Federal regulations and recall authority ensure a high level of safety. Manufacturers have made tremendous strides in improving the safety of their products, not because of some government bureaucracy mandates but because a market-driven economy rewards well-built products. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 3824, which will reduce unnecessary regulation.","word.count":328,"sep11":-3.32303370786517,"years":1998.53651685393,"days":1259,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0180820945956966,"Topic 2":0.384477203533737,"Topic 3":0.00204467437886853,"Topic 4":0.0049637306898062,"Topic 5":0.0379410311619879,"Topic 6":0.00167447065649481,"Topic 7":0.0167265962379865,"Topic 8":0.373623552903491,"Topic 9":0.152544281857612,"Topic 10":0.00792236398432005},{"id":"10920060018855","body":"Steve King: Mr. Speaker, I certainly appreciate the responsibility and the privilege to speak to you in this House and to represent my constituents here. I came over here to raise the issue on a number of bits of subject matter. And as I sat and listened, of course, the subject changed a little bit as I listened to the group here on the other side. And I think that it is important to edify Americans as to the difference between Republicans and Democrats. And I am just really grateful that when I was born and I was reared in a family, I began to build a certain attitude about life. And as that attitude unfolded, I was taught from the beginning to fend for yourself. You are going to have to get out there and make something out of yourself in this lifetime because nobody is going to do it for you. Your ship will never come in. Take control of your life. So at an early age, I realized that when I was born, my glass was half full and it was my job to get out of bed, go to work every day, and go ahead and fill that glass up. I was not raised with an attitude and neither did I gather an attitude that my glass was half empty. I was always grateful that I was born here in America. And when I would ask my parents, what is the best country in the world to come from? They would always answer, The United States of America is the best country in the world. Eat your cold mashed potatoes. There are people starving in China. That is kind of the composite of the upbringing that I had. But grateful for this Nation, and I would always ask why, what is the difference? And probe into these other countries. And, of course, the people starving in China part was what we talked about then. But country after country in the aftermath of World War II, we were the only surviving industrial nation, and this Nation that had preserved freedom for the world, for the entire globe, and had we not done that, we would not be standing here today speaking in English, for example, Mr. Speaker, but speaking in a free way with free ideas and having this free exchange. I stand at the same spot on which Tom DeLay gave his last speech here in this Congress. And he made a point that I think is an important one. And that is that, yes, there is partisanship and, yes, we have sharp disagreements. We have those disagreements because we have a Constitution that protects our right to do so. But he made a point that was, you show me a Nation that does not have partisanship and I will show you a tyranny. So when we disagree, we need to be grateful that we can disagree, and we should base that on fundamental philosophical differences and highlight those. But there is a difference in human nature. Part of human nature is like me that sees our glass half full. Part of human nature is like the people on the other side of the aisle that see their glass and the glass of their constituents as half empty. And that is all right if you look at it from that perspective. But then you have to take it to the next level. And the next level is those that see their glass half full set about going to work to fill it, and we pull each other up the ladder because we know that as we all go out and work and produce and market and save and invest that that helps everyone, that this economy grows. This is not a zero sum game. It is not a goose that has so many golden eggs in it where we can just simply slaughter the goose and harvest the eggs. It is an economy that needs to have inputs. It needs to have capital investment, both intellectual capital and real dollars in a real way. We need to have entrepreneurs. We need to keep generating new ideas. This organism of our economy, has a lot of components in it, and it needs to be working and churning. And when we go in there and we tap into this organism of our economy and we start to take from it and not put into it, then it slows down the growth of our economy and it grows slowly. But this was an economy that when Ronald Reagan was sworn in outside this building in 1980, the Dow Jones was below 1,000. I do not remember the exact number, but I know it was below 1,000. Today it is at 11,000. That is a good measure of what has happened with our economy, and that should be something that should tell, Mr. Speaker, the American people that when your glass is half full and you go to work to fill that glass up the rest of the way and you help your brethren up the ladder along the way that the sum total of the size of the pie, which is divided up amongst now 300 million Americans, gets greater and greater and greater, and that means when the pie is bigger, the size of the pieces can be bigger for each individual that is involved. This is not a matter of taking from the rich and giving to the poor. This is a matter which the argument that I am hearing really slows down this economy and that when you tax someone for the labor they do, you punish them for that labor. Ronald Reagan also said what you tax, you get less of. So we have a first lien on all productivity in America. The Federal Government has the first lien on all productivity in America. So we tax production. We tax earnings, savings and investment. We tax Social Security, we tax your pension, we tax your capital gains, your income tax, your corporate income tax, your partnership income tax. Also we tax your earnings on investments and your Alternative Minimum Tax. All those things are taxed. Well, when there is a tax applied to anything, it is a disincentive to produce. So the first lien on all productivity in America slows down the productivity in America, but it does gather dollars from those wages to run the Federal Government. Now, if you think your glass is half empty and it is not a growing economy, but simply something, a same size pie every year that gets divided up differently depending on who has the political power, not depending on who produces into this economy, eventually what you are doing is you are killing the goose that lays the golden eggs, harvesting the eggs and thinking somehow there is going to be another goose come along. Mr. Speaker, it will not. There will not be another goose come along. This is the one we are going to have to nurture. This economy that is growing, the one producing the golden eggs that are popping out here, it is because people have invested capital and taken risks and put in sweat equity and had a vision and made a sacrifice with their time and their dollars, and sometimes from their families, to make their businesses run or to go to their jobs to help their companies operate, or sit in the basement or up in the attic working sometimes working on inventions that become creative inventions that increase and contribute to this dynamic economy that we have. So much was said about the national debt. My glass is half full and I am going to work to fill it up. Most Americans are doing that. That is why Republicans have control of the House, the Senate and the White House. Some folks believe their glass is half empty, and if they sit around with their tin cup, then let me tell you, that cup will never be full. You have to take charge of your life. Now, that doesn't mean that we don't have compassion. In fact, everybody in America has access to high quality health care. We have the highest percentage of personal ownership of their homes ever in the history of the United States, and, I would submit, in the history of the world. That home ownership was at 68 percent the last time I checked. If you go into the poverty regions, you have a higher home ownership there than ever before. This administration has been great for people who are on the lower income side of this, and I have got a proposal I will talk about that will make it even better yet. But I want to give everybody hope, Mr. Speaker. I want to give them all hope that there is a reason to get out of bed to go to work and make your life better. In fact, to solve the pathologies in the United States, it is a pretty simple equation, and that is simply this: For people who are going to have children, to get married and stay married, get a job and keep a job. Statistically that solves almost all of society's pathologies. It is not a complicated equation. We need to encourage people to go to work. Most do. Out of 300 million people in America, there are 7.5 million on the unemployment rolls. Those numbers have been actually inching down as new jobs have been created. There is about another 4.3 million that are on welfare, and another 5.3 million that have exhausted their unemployment benefits that are still looking for a job but are not technically listed on the unemployment list. That as a percentage of America isn't particularly large, but altogether, between the ages of 16 and on up through retirement, there are 77.5 million non-working Americans in this society. We have a large labor force there that we can go to when we need that labor force. But we have made good progress with the unemployment lists also there. We haven't reached the lowest unemployment. I would point out that when people say we are at full employment at 5 percent unemployment, or 4.7 percent unemployment, I don't accept that number. The lowest unemployment that I can find statistically throughout, at least the last 100 years or so that we have kept records, is 1.2 percent unemployment, and that was during World War II. So I qualify that statement. But that was when we had all hands on deck. If we really get in trouble, we can be all hands on deck again. We haven't needed to do that. So, we do have a large labor force that is here and we can draw from that. But as I listened to the Members on the other side of the aisle, the group that has consistently been down here using the word ``Republican'' as if it were a four letter word, I don't know how to spell it with only four letters, but I know how they say it when it sounds like a four letter word. They talk about the national debt, they talk about a balanced budget and they talk about the b","word.count":4033,"sep11":4.89887640449438,"years":2006.75842696629,"days":4186,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.392939452494579,"Topic 2":0.491549549800077,"Topic 3":0.0109813591920034,"Topic 4":0.0191867938694164,"Topic 5":0.0281063606335708,"Topic 6":0.0088927967748378,"Topic 7":0.0115533164879975,"Topic 8":0.0121044194848106,"Topic 9":0.0178025304432485,"Topic 10":0.00688342081945881},{"id":"10519980005072","body":"Lee Hamilton: Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this legislation Let me first extend my congratulations to the gentleman from Ohio , the chief sponsor of the bill.

Honda: Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 932 This resolution signifies Congress's appreciation for the critical work school counselors do to provide students and their families with guidance and support, both academic and emotional, toward obtaining a higher education and entrance into the workforce. In his 2008 budget, President Bush proposed eliminating federal support for elementary and secondary school counselors. Under Democratic leadership, the President's proposal was wisely rejected and this Congress provided nearly $14 million of additional support to school counseling programs, for a total of over $48 million. I am proud of this accomplishment, but feel there is still more to be done to meet the needs of our children. In California, eight in nine high school students attend a school with fewer counselors than the national average. This makes California the State with the highest counselor to student ratio in the Nation; over two times the School Counseling Association's suggested ratio. Students attending intensely segregated minority schools are most likely to attend schools with fewer counselors than the national average. Addressing the school counselor deficit is a critical component of closing the achievement gap that plagues our Nation. As we reflect on the vital role counselors play in the lives of our children, we should remember that investing in our schools is an investment in our future; it is the best investment our country can make.

Mr. Speaker, this bill tears down one of the biggest barriers that stand between Americans and health insurance coverage. I am glad to be part of legislation and of passing legislation that guarantees millions of Americans insurance coverage as they move from job to job. This bill also prevents discrimination against those individuals with preexisting conditions. This is a bipartisan effort that deserves enormous commendation. Unfortunately, Mr. Chairman, this bill has left 5 million Americans with mental illness behind. I had offered the House amendment in the Committee on Commerce to this bill to guarantee those with mental illness the same coverage as a person with any other illness. Unfortunately, it was ruled out of order. Those mental health provisions, however, were included in the health insurance reform bill in the other body. This conference report fails to include mental health parity language and, therefore, to provide important protections for mental illness. Mental illness is just as serious as hearth disease or cancer, yet insurers have for years not offered complete coverage for the treatment of mental illness. Nearly one out of four adults suffer from some kind of severe mental illness in the United States each year, yet 95 percent of the major insurance companies in our country have limited coverage for psychiatric care. Left untreated, mental illness can lead to some of our Nation's most pressing social problems. For example, 32 percent of the Nation's homeless suffer from some type of mental disorder, 12 million children suffer from some type of mental disorder also. Mr. Speaker, let us pass this bill, but in the future we must address the issue of mental health parity.

The bottom line is, we wouldn't be here today without the leadership of our President. Next, I would like to thank our majority leader, Senator Frist.

We didn't agree on all points, as he stated, but we agreed on most of the substance of the bill and the direction of the policy. Senator Baucus and other conferees, including Senators Lott, Nickles, and Lincoln-- each of the conferees brought strong views to the process. Sometimes those views differed sharply. For instance, as you have seen in tonight's debate, Senator Lincoln and Senator Nickles also do not agree on refundable tax credits. Both of them made principled reasons for their views. They are passionate. The conference agreement reflects a fair balance of those sharply divided positions. This bill would not have come to the floor without the work of staff. I thank them very much. I would like to thank Senate Finance Republican staff, Kolan Davis, staff director; Mark Prater, chief tax counsel; Ed McClennan; Elizabeth Paris Dean Zerbe, whom we also refer to around here on the floor as ``the white tornado.''

With Senator Lincoln's staff, Mac Campbell; Senator Nickles' staff: Rachel Jones, and Hazen Marshall. Mr. President, I would like to sum up what this bill is all about. As the bill title says, it is about America's families. It is about providing tax relief to hard-working men and women in America. When I think about it, I consider the families on the farms back home. In the fields of Iowa, folks are starting the harvest. In the factories of Davenport, IA, and in the offices in Des Moines, great insurance companies, people are working hard to raise their kids, and this bill will help them. Let me take some time here to correct what have been very troubling statements about the Working Families Tax Relief Act and its benefits for low-income working families. Let's be clear--this bill provides enormous benefits to working families and especially to low-income families. Let me remind my colleagues of where we have been on this bill. The Senate passed legislation in 2003 that called for accelerating the refundability of the child credit from 10 percent to 15 percent, providing for a uniform definition of a child, and including combat pay for purposes of calculating the child tax credit. That was what the Senate passed in 2003. At the same time, the other body passed legislation that also accelerated the refundability but the other body did not include the uniform definition of a child and did not include the combat pay provisions as it relates to the child tax credit. We then went to conference and thanks to President Bush's leadership we have been successful in reaching an agreement. What does our conference bill do in regards to the Senate-passed legislation affecting low-income families? The conference report agrees with every single one of them. Let me repeat that, the conference report accepted every single provision in the Senate-passed bill that was directed to helping low-income families. The conference made the uniform definition of a child permanent. This is an extremely important simplification effort that creates a uniform definition of a child for the dependency exemption, child credit, the Earned Income Credit, the dependent care credit, and head-of-household filing status. This long-overdue simplification makes many more taxpayers--especially low-income taxpayers--eligible for a child- related benefit. This is at a cost of over $1.5 billion over 10 years and is the only substantive tax provision in this bill that is made permanent. The conference agreed to accelerate refundability and also the combat pay provisions in the Senate-passed legislation. These two provisions provide over $2 billion in benefits. So again, as people wring their hands, lets remember that the conference agreed to every single tax provision in the Senate-passed bill targeted for low-income families. In fact, there was only one provision in the Senate bill that was targeted to help families making over $100,000--the elimination of the marriage penalty of the child credit. What happened that provision? It was dropped in conference. But the conference did not stop with just accepting all the Senate provisions that help low-income families. The conference added to the provisions that will help low-income families. First, the conference provided expanded benefits for our men and women in uniform receiving combat pay. They will now also be able to get expanded benefits under the earned income credit. While combat pay is excluded for income purposes, our soldiers, sailors and airmen can elect to include combat pay if it will assist them in getting an increase in the earned income credit. This is a new provision that helps low-income military families. It was not included in the Senate proposal. This, combined with other provisions in the bill means that targeted relief for low-income military families receiving combat pay is increased in this conference report by nearly six times over what was provided in the Senate proposal. Let me repeat that, the conference report provides almost six times greater targeted relief for military families receiving combat pay then was included in the Senate proposal. Turning to the other items that assist low-income families: Second, the conference increases the child credit to $1,000 and extends it through 2010. This will benefit low and middle-income families. Third, we extend the lowest tax-bracket, the 10 percent tax bracket, which at its core benefits low-income families. Fourth, we extend marriage penalty relief which helps low-income taxpayers along with all taxpayers. There is over $23 billion in outlays contained in this bill--that reflects primarily the extension of the child credit, the lowering of the rates and refundability portions. Thus, of a $145 billion tax cut, over $23 billion of it is targeted to low-income families who have little to no federal income tax liability. So lets put this to rest. The conference report is better then what the Senate proposed for low-income families and better then what the Senate proposed to help military families. Now, let me turn to another chestnut that has been put out. That chestnut is that the tax laws will harm 4 million low-income families. This is a bait and switch focusing on one issue and ignores the overall tax code and all the tax legislation contained in this bill. The threshold for the refundable child tax credit--included in the 2001 bill--is that for those who do not pay taxes should still benefit from the child tax credit beginning at $10,000 in income--and that was indexed for inflation. This was agreed to by the supporters of this provision in 2001 and eliminating the index was not included in the Senate proposal last year. Unfortunately we are now hearing from those who don't want to be reminded of these facts. I am saddened by those who want to muddy all the tremendous work we have accomplished for working families in this bill. To argue that we are raising taxes on those making less than $11,000 or less is completely and utterly wrong. First, it is current law that requires indexing, there is nothing in this bill that requires indexing. Second, these are families who do not have a federal income tax liability. They pay no taxes. So it is wrong to say that they are having an increase in taxes. Third, the naysayers completely ignore the benefits being provided in this bill when they pull numbers from thin air. For example, the indexing of the $10,000 next year provided in the 2001 bill will mean that a family making $18,000 with a child will lose approximately $40 in child credit benefits, but that same family--because of this bill-- will see their child credit benefit increase by $300 because of the accelerated refundability and making the child credit $1000. The naysayers want to just pick and choose the provisions and not look at the whole package. When you look at the overall package the vast majority of the families they talk about being harmed by the 2001 agreement to index the refundable credit will actually be benefiting from the overall package. And finally for those families--far, far fewer than the number of 4 million thrown around--that may see no child credit because of indexing, we must bear in mind the EIC benefits","word.count":2805,"sep11":3.1123595505618,"years":2004.97191011236,"days":3550,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0576701968447045,"Topic 2":0.0184833595769397,"Topic 3":0.0611023336644643,"Topic 4":0.00477020565078681,"Topic 5":0.0133228280530289,"Topic 6":0.64424697534939,"Topic 7":0.00229083657677856,"Topic 8":0.117838547768264,"Topic 9":0.00722463718510814,"Topic 10":0.073050079330535},{"id":"10820030056923","body":"Tom Harkin: Mr. President, the recommendation of the Armed Services Committee is a proper, cautious, moderate increase.

What a great and important story we have to tell our children, that we have to tell the world: the story of our War of Independence. And the land, the houses, the bridges and so much of New Jersey today tell that story. As many of my colleagues know, New Jersey is often referred to as the crossroads of the American Revolution. For a number of reasons, thousands of troops crisscrossed the State and fought on our soil. The State's strategic location between the British stronghold of New York and the rebel capital in Philadelphia meant that New Jersey, New Jersey citizens, were at the crossroads. In fact, New Jersey had more military engagements during the Revolutionary War than any other State. Although historians may know this, some of us are working hard to make sure that the role of New Jersey during the Revolution is understood more broadly. Some of the most important events of the war, especially the pivotal battles of Trenton and Princeton, took place in New Jersey. New Jersey has hundreds of remnants of the war today surviving, including over 250 National Register Revolutionary War sites that are included in this heritage area designation covering 15 counties. Many traces of our Nation's Revolutionary War heritage still exist: mines, mills, encampment sites, battlegrounds, and barracks. Some of the sites include the Hunt House, in Hopewell, New Jersey, the first headquarters of General Washington as he chased the British from New York to Pennsylvania; or the old barracks in Trenton, where the troops were housed; Rockingham House, where General Washington wrote his farewell message to the troops; or a road through the woods, now long abandoned, on which the soldiers marched to the battle of Monmouth; the Sandy Hook Lighthouse, which was the guardian of New York Harbor and used by both British and American armies. The list goes on and on, and that is why this designation of a heritage area is so important for New Jersey. Most notable in our history books, of course, is the famous crossing of the Delaware by General Washington and his men. What happened at the crossing of Delaware is a story that must be told again and again so all generations will know this military feat and the new life it gave to the American Revolution. By the winter of 1776, the War for Independence was going badly. General Washington and his Continental Army had experienced defeat after defeat and retreated to Pennsylvania for the winter. It was brutally cold and morale was low. Many were losing faith in the leadership of General Washington. By late afternoon on Christmas Day 1776, over 2,400 troops began to cross the icy water of the Delaware. The weather made the operation difficult. The troops were forced to fight their way through blinding winter weather. The sleet and snow proved too much for two of the divisions to the south, and General Washington's troops made the attack alone. Against all odds, Washington and his soldiers completed the crossing, marched silently to Trenton, with cannon, and on Christmas night arrived taking the Hessian garrison completely by surprise. This engagement, followed by the pivotal Battle of Princeton, has been called ``the beginning of the winning.'' Military engagements were fought throughout New Jersey, and they gave the first glimpse to the world that the American people might succeed in this fight for independence. In New Jersey, also, there was the crossroads of ideas. There were people loyal to the Crown and those who were loyal to Adams and Washington and the other revolutionaries. The difference was contested within families, in towns, and on farmsteads. New Jersey really was at the crux of the Revolution, the crossroads of the American Revolution. I became involved in this effort to establish the Crossroads when I first came to Congress in 1999. And with the guidance and leadership from historians and planners, champions of open space preservation, such as Dr. Ted Stiles, I developed the concept of this heritage designation. I sought the assistance of my colleague from New Jersey , and we were able to see the passage of legislation that would direct the Park Service to conduct a feasibility study of the region. We passed this feasibility study with flying colors, obtaining an enthusiastic report from the Park Service that New Jersey had a rich history and many surviving remnants of the War of Independence that make the region a fine candidate for a heritage area. Since the study, many State legislators, local governments, and other organizations have endorsed the idea of establishing the Crossroads of the American Revolution Heritage Area. After the initial findings from the National Park Service in August 2002, Representative Frelinghuysen and I introduced the Crossroads of the American Revolution National Heritage Act. Finally, today, we have it before us on the floor of this body. Establishing this heritage area is an important way to preserve the historic remnants that will allow the telling of New Jersey's role in the building of this great Nation. It combines historic preservation, environmental protection, education, recreation, open space acquisition, travel, and tourism. The creation of the heritage area means a great deal for all of these organizations, private and public, in New Jersey that are working in all of these areas to acquire open space, to provide for recreation and education and environmental protection. Community leaders and local governments who care deeply about preserving open space and protecting historic sites will work with the local management agency to achieve these goals. The National Heritage Area will be, I think, important for the education not just of the children of New Jersey but for the people of this country. Everyone should know what New Jersey brought to the American Revolution, and preserving these sites and tying them together under this theme will certainly help in this endeavor. Our current Governor of New Jersey, Jon Corzine, before he left Capitol Hill, succeeded in carrying this through the other body across the Capitol, and I want to thank all of those involved over the past years that have been instrumental in designating the Crossroads of the American Revolution Heritage Area. I see no better way to honor New Jersey and the people who were instrumental during the American Revolution than by establishing this heritage area.","word.count":1090,"sep11":4.99157303370786,"years":2006.85112359551,"days":4219,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0485405132836481,"Topic 2":0.0856747186185049,"Topic 3":0.409401208534922,"Topic 4":0.16744672075434,"Topic 5":0.00655390240969388,"Topic 6":0.0394086627654859,"Topic 7":0.00455200677790086,"Topic 8":0.119033318045468,"Topic 9":0.00836272788543167,"Topic 10":0.111026220924605},{"id":"11020070104381","body":"Barbara Boxer: Madam President, the Captive Primate Safety Act, S. 1498, is an important, bipartisan bill promoting the humane treatment of animals and protecting public health and safety from the considerable risks associated with primate pet ownership and trade. On May 24, 2007, I introduced S. 1498, with Senators Vitter, Lautenberg, Lieberman, and Menendez. Senator Ensign is also a cosponsor. Nonhuman primates are susceptible to many biological agents that infect human beings, including tuberculosis, Ebola/Marburg, and poxviruses. Because of the serious health risk, importing nonhuman primates into the United States for the pet trade has been banned by Federal regulation since 1975. In addition, many States already prohibit these animals as pets. Still, there is an active trade in these animals. Estimates are that 15,000 are in private hands; however, as the trade is largely unregulated, the number may be much higher. Because many of these animals move in interstate commerce, Federal legislation is needed. This legislation amends the Lacey Act to prohibit transporting monkeys, great apes, lemurs, and other non- human primates across State lines for the pet trade. The bill has no impact on trade or transportation of animals for zoos, medical and other licensed research facilities, or certain other licensed and regulated entities. The Captive Primate Safety Act is supported by the Humane Society of the United States, the American Zoo and Aquarium Association, the American Veterinary Medical Association, Defenders of Wildlife and the Wildlife Conservation Society and many other environmental organizations and animal welfare groups.","word.count":247,"sep11":6.43258426966292,"years":2008.29213483146,"days":4732,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.127687451465312,"Topic 2":0.0138415611603914,"Topic 3":0.0849341638466231,"Topic 4":0.046765270407075,"Topic 5":0.00657157549218804,"Topic 6":0.0112365012574269,"Topic 7":0.520046919643605,"Topic 8":0.110491141133636,"Topic 9":0.00906205927502113,"Topic 10":0.0693633563187215},{"id":"10519980051190","body":"Gordon Smith: Mr. President, I happened to be sitting in the Presiding Officer's chair when the distinguished Senator from Texas came and spoke of her concerns about NATO expansion and expressed some of her regret that some of the debate had been cast in terms of, those who are opposed are somehow less than patriotic or pursuing appeasement. I want her to know that while I am a strong advocate for NATO expansion, I view with appreciation and respect all my colleagues who, for reasons of their conclusions and conscience, have decided that this is not appropriate. The Senator from Texas has made some points that I think are valid parts of this debate. I would like to respond to the point, however, that she made about the advisability of having a formal dispute resolution process in the NATO alliance. On the surface, I think this may strike some as a very good idea because within the alliance there are long and historic disputes between member countries. I note that it is a matter of historical record that NATO membership has been one of the primary ways in which longstanding enemies such as Germany and France have been able to resolve these historic enmities, I think in large part because of NATO. This is also occurring on a daily basis as Greece and Turkey--two NATO allies of ours--struggle to remain peaceful neighbors; also between the Spanish and the Portuguese, issues of borders and islands are being resolved; between the British and the Spanish there are ongoing discussions about the island of Gibraltar. All of this is occurring between NATO members. I believe there is a very informal process going on that because you are a NATO member you don't attack your allies. This is a powerful peer pressure, if you will, that exists in a nonformal way in the NATO alliance. Why shouldn't there be a formal process? I will tell you this: If it isn't broken, don't try to fix it. Moreover, what NATO does is have all of us who are members who have disparate national interests focus on one common theme, which is common security, a secure alliance, so that all of a sudden you get Germans and Frenchmen--hopefully Hungarians and Czechs--countries that have had disputes over the past--all of a sudden they will be working together for a common goal of mutual defense. Now, if all of a sudden we say we recognize you have these internal problems or national disputes and we want you to take those into NATO, then what have we done? We have all of a sudden taken a defensive alliance and turned it into a mini European United Nations. I suggest that is the wrong thing to do for NATO. NATO needs to keep its purpose as a defensive alliance and it must not become a vehicle, a formal vehicle, for resolving national disputes. It has been a way in which we cooperate and get along and focus on common purposes and solving common problems, not as a vehicle for bringing our national interests and resolving them within this alliance. I suggest, while on the surface this amendment sounds very good, it would operate in a very destructive fashion for NATO's well-being in the future. There are already institutions for resolving these kinds of differences, dispute resolutions. NATO must never be one of those. Now, I have said this with the greatest respect for the Senator from Texas. I know of few people who are more thoughtful and more dedicated to their task in the U.S. Senate than Senator Hutchison. She is a great woman by any measure. I say that even though I intend to vote and lobby against her amendment. I yield the floor.","word.count":623,"sep11":-3.57022471910112,"years":1998.2893258427,"days":1171,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0098978643252469,"Topic 2":0.0247457588385871,"Topic 3":0.0381164076437393,"Topic 4":0.011389553445405,"Topic 5":0.00667361803951694,"Topic 6":0.00494058670250969,"Topic 7":0.788074194780402,"Topic 8":0.079554660835575,"Topic 9":0.0145713079796657,"Topic 10":0.0220360474093528},{"id":"10620000045774","body":"Mitch McConnell: Mr. President, despite the Administration's objection to expanding the favorable tax treatment of these state plans, I am pleased that Congress has achieved real reform over the past several years. In 1996, Congress took the first step in providing tax relief to families investing in these programs. In the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, I was able to include a provision that clarified the tax treatment of state-sponsored savings plans and the participants' investment. This measure put an end to the tax uncertainty that has hampered the effectiveness of these state- sponsored programs and helped families who are trying to save for their children's education. In 1997, the Taxpayer Relief Act made revisions to provide increased flexibility to families saving for their children's college education. The most significant reform was to expand the definition of ``qualified education costs'' to include room and board, thus doubling the amount families could save tax-free. As a result of our actions over the last several years, more and more state plans have implemented tuition savings and prepaid plans for their residents. It is projected that there will be 44 states with tuition savings plans by the year 2000. I believe that we have a real opportunity to go even further toward making college affordable to American families. It is in our best interest as a nation to maintain a quality and affordable education system for everyone. By passing this legislation, we can help families help themselves by rewarding savings. This will reduce the cost of education and will not unnecessarily burden future generations with thousands of dollars in loans. In addition to making savings in qualified State and private college tuition plans completely tax-free, this legislation makes a number of other changes that are essential to helping families afford a quality education. Specifically, this legislation increases the contributions for K-12 education savings accounts to help families meet the expenses of a primary education. This legislation creates incentives for employer-provided educational assistance so that individuals can continue their education while working. This legislation also changes the rules for interest deductions so that qualified education loans are more affordable for students. Additionally, this legislation revises the National Health Corps Scholarships Exclusion, increases the arbitrage rebate exception on tax-exempt bonds, provides for private activity bonds for qualified education facilities, and allows the Federal Home Loan Bank to guarantee school construction bonds. These important reforms are critical to helping families save for the future. I urge my colleagues to support this valuable legislation this year to reward those who save in order to provide a college education for their children.","word.count":434,"sep11":-1.57303370786517,"years":2000.28651685393,"days":1882,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.259501786210338,"Topic 2":0.149301039506174,"Topic 3":0.013258958542555,"Topic 4":0.00894756094547109,"Topic 5":0.0119939164176451,"Topic 6":0.00725083256312891,"Topic 7":0.313577782937357,"Topic 8":0.0777586826237257,"Topic 9":0.152652476087811,"Topic 10":0.00575696416579383},{"id":"10720010064193","body":"Bob Torricelli: Mr. President, the Washington, DC, area is in the midst of a terrible crisis. As we all know too well, a murderer has gunned down nine people in cold blood during the past two weeks. Two other victims, including a child, have by the grace of God survived these sick and senseless attacks. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the bereaved, even as we try to comfort and reassure our own families and communities. I am confident that the deranged person or persons causing all this suffering will be caught. The attempt to hold this area hostage to fear and intimidation will fail, and law enforcement officers will bring the guilty to justice. As investigators are running down tips and testing forensic evidence, a sudden cry has gone up in some quarters demanding the dramatic expansion of a process known as ``ballistic imaging.'' This technology is a tool employed to assist law enforcement in the analysis of crimes committed with a firearm. I would like to take a moment to talk about this technology and make sure all our colleagues understand its benefits and limitations. It is easy for good people in the heat and emotion of these troubled times to be swept away by apparently easy solutions to enormously complex problems, and I believe that before we begin to think about expanding ballistic imaging in the United States, we should first take stock of what we do know. Ballistic imaging technology can be a useful tool in the investigation of crimes committed with firearms. As currently used, forensic experts are able to electronically scan into a database a shell casing recovered from a crime scene to determine if that case matches those from other crime scenes. The technology can serve as a starting point in assisting law enforcement in determining if the same firearm was involved in multiple crimes. The Federal Government has worked for nearly 10 years on developing an imaging network. The National Integrated Ballistic Information Network, NIBIN, administered by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, BATF, provides Federal, State, and local law enforcement officials with critical ballistics information on crimes committed with a firearm. This system matches shell casings recovered from crime scenes to ascertain if a firearm has been used in multiple assaults. By focusing strictly on cases recovered from crime scenes, NIBIN cannot be used to build a database of firearm owners, thereby guaranteeing the security and legal rights of millions of Americans who are law-abiding gun owners. How does it work? When a firearm is discharged, both the shell casing and the bullet traveling down the barrel of the gun are imprinted with distinctive marks. The bullet takes on marks from the barrel's rifling, and the casing is marked by the gun's breech face, firing pin and shell ejector mechanism. Some guns, such as revolvers or single-shot rifles, might not leave ejection marks. These imprints are distinctive to a firearm. A ballistic imaging program can run a casing through its database and select those that offer a close match. A final identification is made visually by a highly trained ballistic examiner. This process does not lend itself to examining bullets from a firearm. Often, bullets are severely damaged on impact. Bullets recovered are usually examined visually by experts. It is critically important to understand that this is not ``ballistic DNA'' or ``ballistic fingerprinting.'' Unlike DNA or fingerprints that do not change over time, the unique marks that can identify a particular bullet or shell casing can change because of a number of environmental and use factors. Barrels and operating parts of firearms change with use and wear and tear over time. Moreover, a person can, within minutes, use a file to scratch marks in a barrel or breech face, or replace a firing pin, extractor, and barrel thereby giving a firearm a completely ``new'' ballistic identity. In other words, imaging remains a tool, but not a silver bullet, in criminal investigations. Legitimate concerns have been raised about creating a national database that would store ballistic images from all firearms sold. We know that such a database would involve huge costs to the government, firearms manufacturers, and customers. Furthermore, it raises questions about a legal ``chain of evidence,'' i.e., how to handle and store hundreds of millions of bullets or shell casings without exposing all such evidence to attack by defense lawyers. It could also break existing law by creating a database of law-abiding firearms owners and prove much less effective than NIBIN. A recent study completed by the California Department of Forensic Services on creating a ballistic imaging network merely on a statewide level stated: ``When applying this technology to the concept of mass sampling of manufactured firearms, a huge inventory of potential candidates will be generated for manual review. This study indicates that the number of candidate cases will be so large as to be impractical and will likely create logistic complications so great that they cannot be effectively addressed.'' The study pointed out that when expanding the database of spent shell casings, the system will generate so many ``hits'' that could be potential matches, it would not be of any use to forensic examiners. Other problems included guns making different markings on casings from different ammunition manufacturers; the shipping, handling, and storage of spent shell casings; the fact that some firearms do not leave marks that can be traced back to that particular firearm; and the requirement of highly-trained personnel for proper operation. What about the success rate of statewide systems already in operation? Maryland introduced its own ballistic imaging system in 2000. Every new handgun that is sold in the State must be accompanied by spent shell casings for input into the imaging network. According to Maryland budget figures, approximately $5 million has been spent on the system. According to Maryland law enforcement officials, it contains over 11,000 imaged cartridges, has been queried a total of 155 times and has not been responsible for solving any crimes. Meanwhile, in New York, there have been thousands of cartridges entered into their database and, according to reports, no traces have resulted in criminal prosecutions. Let me raise one more concern. It is clear that any ballistic imaging network would only be as good as the records it contains. While all the proposals put forward deal with compiling information from new firearms, today in the United States, it is estimated that there are more than 200 million firearms in private hands. It would be impossible to retrieve these firearms for ballistics documentation without violating the constitutional rights of millions of law abiding firearms owners. All of these considerations should be food for thought to anyone seriously contemplating a national ballistic imaging network. At the very least, they support the conclusion that we should look, and look carefully, before we leap into this system. President Bush is calling for a study of the ballistic imaging technology, and so are some members of Congress. For example, the Ballistic Imaging Evaluation and Study Act, introduced in both the House and Senate by the bipartisan, bicameral team of Representative Melissa Hart and Senator Zell Miller, would order the Department of Justice to contract for a study by the National Academy of Sciences, which would examine the many questions surrounding imaging technology and provide a list of recommendations to policymakers and Congress. Enacting legislation to begin a study of this technology should be a priority. The proper allocation of dollars to fight crime is critical to ensuring safe communities, and we should obtain firm scientific conclusions on which to base decisions on how best to deploy this technology.","word.count":1546,"sep11":-0.0140449438202247,"years":2001.84550561798,"days":2437,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0701541777446131,"Topic 2":0.423869042913727,"Topic 3":0.0256546228696501,"Topic 4":0.0146813430052018,"Topic 5":0.441433207465982,"Topic 6":0.00380577322892504,"Topic 7":0.00317064003870524,"Topic 8":0.00801322773000098,"Topic 9":0.00375907252078678,"Topic 10":0.00545889248240709},{"id":"10620000002502","body":"Bob Etheridge: Mr. Speaker, this evening I want to talk with my colleagues about the future. As I talk about the future, I want to talk about the children of this country, because they truly are our future. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to talk about education, particularly an effort in education called character education. We talk about a lot of things that work and things that do not work; but as my colleagues know, before I came to the people's House to serve in this body, I was the State superintendent of schools in the State of North Carolina. As I have told many of my colleagues from time to time, there are a lot of things in education that a lot of us who work in it, if we are honest with ourselves, do not know a great deal about when we do do some of the things that work and a lot of the things that do not work. I happen to know firsthand that character education can make a difference to teach our children values and make sure that our students are well rounded and prepared to become good citizens. In 1989 when I took over as State superintendent, we did a survey of about 25,000 students across our State, and I was quite alarmed at some of the results we got back. About 37 percent of the students said that they did not respect their fellow students nor their teachers, and it was quite obvious from that data that something needed to be done. We pulled together teachers, administrators, members of the clergy. We pulled together members from the bench and we did an extensive study for about a year and a half, almost 2 years, and came up with what we called ethics education. We put together some principles, and ultimately that evolved into character education. It was later adopted by the State board of education and then the North Carolina general assembly in 1995; and we received a grant in 1995 from the U.S. Department of Education to begin a process in three of our school districts, three of the larger ones, incidentally, Wake County, Cumberland County, and Mecklenberg County to pilot character education. Now, across my congressional district, school leaders have developed character education initiatives that really are making a difference for stronger schools and better communities. Wake County, as I just mentioned, was one of the early leaders. Not only were they a leader by receiving the funds and initiating the project and having community meetings, because this truly is based at the school level and the community level; but they have become a leader through their innovative effort that they call Uniting for Character. In that process, there are a number of principles that they focus on and that they come together on, which are respect, citizenship, justice and fairness, honesty, caring, respect and trustworthiness are the core; and each community must develop those issues that they believe in. What we recommend is that the educators, the parents, the business community, all in the community come together and work together collaboratively to come up with those core issues that they want to use. In Johnston County, another county in the district, they have come together and done theirs. The principal of Selma Elementary School, a school which I visited just a few weeks ago, attributes 59 fewer suspensions during the 1995-1996 school year to their character education program. They also attribute the fact that they have had academic growth, tremendous academic growth over the years and again this year, and I visited that school again to see what kind of progress they were making. They again are showing progress as a result of character education. It is not a program that teachers have to struggle with as another addition to their already crowded school day. It is integrated in the curriculum in the standard course of study that we use in North Carolina, and it is taught along with everything else they do, and I will talk about that more in just a few moments. Mr. Speaker, some of my colleagues and certainly others across the country may have seen the CBS News profile that was done several months ago on one of the successful character education programs in the Nash Rocky Mount school system, Baskerville Elementary School, a school that really was having a difficult time. They were having problems with truancy, they were having problems with discipline, their academics were suffering, and under the leadership of a dynamic principal named Anne Edge, she took this on, she got her staff involved, she got the community involved, and she literally indoctrinated the children in that school, and it is working well. I visited there several weeks ago, and I can tell my colleagues as a result of that program being implemented properly and being supported by the community, supported by the central office staff and the local school board, that is one public school that has turned around and is making a difference and it has become infectious. It is working all across Nash Rocky Mount school system in North Carolina. This morning, Mr. Speaker, I had the opportunity to visit Tramway Elementary School in Lee County, another school in my district where character education really fills the entire community with hope. I went into that school this morning, and I was so pleased to see the number of parents who were there. They were there participating, active in the school. They had other members of the school faculty there, but the impressive part of it was what was happening with the students. The young people in that classroom gave reports, probably half the class got up and read reports and shared with me and with the others present what character education had done, what a difference it had made, and the different character traits that they had picked up as a result of reading such books over the last several months as Charlotte's Web and any other number of books that they had been assigned to read as special reading projects. That is what making good citizens is all about. When we have good citizens in the classroom, we have good citizens in the school; and it flows over into the community, and it goes home with the children. They are reinforcing in Tramway Elementary and Baskerville Elementary and schools all across the second district, and certainly across North Carolina, what parents are teaching at home; and in some cases, children are taking it home and reinforcing it with parents and really helping parents understand. I was in Combs Elementary School in Wake County, one of the first schools I visited talking about this issue of character education and the bill that I introduced on February 16 entitled character education, or Character Counts in the 21st Century. We have in that school children speaking languages from probably about 12 to 14 different countries. It was amazing how they were sharing and helping one another, talking about these issues of character that brings them together, that helps those children be better students academically and better students in terms of sharing within that school environment being good citizens. Mr. Speaker, character education works because it teaches our children to see the world through a moral lens. Children learn that actions do have consequences, and if we deal with it at an early age with early intervention, we will see a difference not only in our classrooms, but in our communities and across this country, and many of the challenges that we are facing together we will not have to face in the future. Yes, we will continue to face the challenges in the adult community for years to come, but we need to get back to those principles that we talked about many years ago, and character education certainly works. It works when teachers work with parents and with children and with the entire community to instill a spirit of a shared responsibility. That is why character education is so important, if we can get it on issues like this that are important to the community. Education is a shared responsibility. I try to remind my colleagues here and in every speech I give back home, education starts in the home; and if there is no education in the home, the challenge of teachers is almost insurmountable. How in the world, if we cannot teach one child or two children at home, do we expect a teacher to take the responsibility of 30? It is a shared responsibility. When we talk about character education and we emphasize those values, as I talked about earlier, of courage, and certainly courage is important in everything we do; good judgment, as we talk to children; integrity in our teaching every day in the various courses, whether it be math, whether it be history; kindness, in the things that children do for one another, and we reward those things. It is one thing to be punished; it is another thing to be rewarded when one does something good. Children learn very quickly in life, if they get rewarded for doing good things, they will do good things again. And if they are not rewarded, and all they see is punishment and the dark side of life, I can tell my colleagues it will be difficult. Early intervention works. Kindness. Perseverance. We can teach it without having it laid on to something else. We can do it in the course of what we are teaching every day. How we respect one another. We respect other's property; we respect the school property, and it carries over into the community where young people work with their brothers and sisters, where they do it on the job. Self-discipline. Self-discipline is an important value. These are principles we can agree on. They are things that the community decides they want to do. It brings the PTAs together with the teachers, with the community interest. It is important. As a father of two public school teachers, my heart aches for the victims of recent school violence. I can assure my colleagues that not only do the parents hurt, but so do all of those folks who work with children, whether it was in their school or not, because it affects them.

Unfortunately, our colleagues on the other side have put forward some, well, let's say some inaccuracies. The fact of the matter is that over the last 4 years, when this process began, the administration has been working very closely with hundreds and hundreds of meetings in a bipartisan way to come together so that we can do what both Democrats and Republicans alike have said that they want to do, strengthen our ties within this hemisphere and do what we can to ensure that we bring about an agreement which will work to create jobs right here in the United States. The distinguished ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee has just reminded me of the fact that every country with which we have a free trade agreement, every single country, we enjoy a surplus of trade, a trade surplus. So the notion that pursuing these FTAs somehow costs us jobs is preposterous, and the facts don't hold it up. One of our friends on the other side of the aisle, the gentleman from Oregon , talked about the fact that we were the manufacturing giant in 1974, 34 years ago, when fast track authority was put into place. And I will tell him that today we are still the world's manufacturing giant. In 1974, we had a $1.5 trillion economy; today, we have a $14.1 trillion economy. So as was said by the Republican leader, Mr. Boehner, this is a no- brainer, as Mr. McCrery said, this is a no-brainer economically. We need to recognize that if we as a Nation are going to maintain our leadership role, we have to shape it. Vote ``no'' on this horrible Hugo Chavez rule, Mr. Speaker.

I believe it is the only section of the bankruptcy code that is sunset from time to time. It is not a permanent part of the bankruptcy code. It was passed about 13 years ago to meet the needs of agriculture in depression in the 1980s, and it has been renewed by Congress continually since then. It has been a very successful part of the bankruptcy code because, of the farmers who have sought the protection of chapter 12, an Iowa State University study indicates that 84 percent are still in business farming, family farmers still farming. We are at a situation where 1 year ago, about this period of time, chapter 12 actually sunset. It was extended for 6 months in the omnibus spending bill because the feeling was that we wanted to take it up at the very same time a revision of the entire bankruptcy code was taken up. The comprehensive bill is the bill that Senator Torricelli has spoken about and which I will discuss shortly. Within that bill, there is a permanency brought to chapter 12 in the bankruptcy code so it will no longer sunset. The March 31 deadline came, and this bill was not up. It was extended yet again for 6 months. I urged the majority leader to extend it for a year because I anticipated some of the problems we have recently faced regarding the bankruptcy code. It was thought by a lot of interests in this city that it was necessary to have chapter 12 not made permanent, separate from the entire bankruptcy law, because it was needed to help get the general bankruptcy revisions through. So it was extended for another 6 months. This week it is going to expire again. It is ludicrous that the House of Representatives, just yesterday, passed only a 3-month extension of chapter 12 so that somehow if we don't get this permanent bankruptcy bill passed, we are going to have chapter 12 expiring again on New Year's Eve. That is a Y2K problem for agriculture we better be alerted to because Congress is not going to be in session on New Year's Eve to renew chapter 12. I hope that when the Senate considers the House version, we ignore it, and we move with a permanent extension of chapter 12 bankruptcy which I introduced last week and which is currently on the calendar. As the Senators from West Virginia, New Jersey, and also the Senator from Montana were just speaking about the agricultural crisis, it is that way in agriculture any place in the United States. This is no time to play footsie with chapter 12 being extended for just a 3-month period of time. Those are games that don't need to be played. They don't do justice to agriculture in America, and they do not put the family farmer in the forefront of our policymaking or thinking in Washington. I want to go to this issue about which Senator Torricelli spoke--the Senate not invoking cloture on the bankruptcy bill last week. While this is unfortunate, I think it is important to say a few words in support of the bill outside of the adversarial context and the very political context of the cloture vote. I think it would really be a tragedy if both parties can't come together and deal with this bill, which has such broad support from Senators on both sides of the aisle. It was voted out of committee by a 14 to 4 vote, very bipartisan. Bankruptcy reform is really all about a return to personal responsibility in a bankruptcy system which actively discourages personal responsibility by wiping away debts on a no-questions-asked basis. Basic common sense tells you every time a debt is wiped away through bankruptcy, someone loses money. Of course, when somebody who extends credit has that obligation wiped away in bankruptcy, that creditor is forced to make a decision: Should this loss simply be swallowed as a cost of doing business? Or, do you raise prices for other customers to offset those losses? When bankruptcy losses are rare and infrequent, lenders may be able to swallow a loss. But when bankruptcies are very frequent and common, as they are today, lenders have to raise their prices to offset losses. For this reason, when Treasury Secretary Larry Summers testified at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee, he said that bankruptcies tend to drive up interest rates. If you believe Secretary Summers, bankruptcies are everyone's problem. Regular, hard-working Americans have to pay higher prices for goods and services as a result of bankruptcies. That is a real problem for the American people, and one which the Senate has an obligation to tackle. Under our current bankruptcy laws, someone can get full debt cancellation in chapter 7 with no questions asked. If we pass our reform bill, if someone seeking bankruptcy can repay his or her debts, they will be channeled into chapter 13 of the bankruptcy code, which requires people to pay some portion of their debts as a precondition for limited debt cancellation. The bankruptcy bill, which the Senate will hopefully consider soon, will discourage bankruptcies and, therefore, lessen upward pressure on interest rates and prices. Right now, under present bankruptcy laws, one of the richest captains of industry could walk into bankruptcy court and walk away with his debts erased. Of course, the rest of America will pay higher prices for goods and services as a result. If we pass this bill, higher-income people will be unable to use bankruptcy as a financial planning tool. All Americans will be better off. The message of Senate bill 625 is simple: If you have the ability to pay debt, you will not get off scot-free. These are good times in our Nation, thanks to the fiscal discipline initiated by Congress, and the hard work of the American people--and more due to the hard work of the American people than what we have done in Congress. We have the first balanced budget in a generation, unemployment is low, we have a burgeoning stock market. Most Americans, except for the American farmers who are in a depression, are optimistic about the future. But in the midst of such prosperity, about one and a half million Americans declared bankruptcy in 1998. Based on filings for the first two quarters of 1999, it looks like there will be just under 1.4 million bankruptcy filings for this year. To put this in some historical context, since 1990, the rate of personal bankruptcy filings has increased almost 100 percent. Now, I don't think anyone knows all of the reasons--I don't pretend to know either--underlying the bankruptcy crisis. But I think I can talk about what is not at the root of the bankruptcy crisis. I have a chart here that has four smaller charts on it that I think demonstrates it is not the economy that is driving the crisis. Here we have the high rise in bankruptcies over the last 6 years, a very rapid near 100-percent increase in bankruptcy filings. We have, during that same period of time, a very dramatic drop in unemployment in the country. We have a very sharp rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. We have a rise in the average wage of American workers. This shows that it is not the economy that is causing so many bankruptcies. The economic numbers tell us that the bankruptcy crisis isn't a result of people who can't get jobs; and the jobs that people do have are paying more than ever. So the bankruptcy crisis isn't about desperate people confronting layoffs and underemployment. With the economy doing well and with so many Americans with high-quality, good- paying jobs, we have to look deep into the eroding moral values of some people to find out what is driving the bankruptcy crisis. Some people flat out don't want to honor their obligations and are looking for an easy way out. In the opinion of this Senator, a significant part of the bankruptcy crisis is basically a moral crisis. Some people just don't have a sense of personal responsibility. It seems clear to me that our lax bankruptcy system must bear some of the blame for the bankruptcy crisis. Just as the old welfare system encouraged people not to get jobs and encouraged people not to even think about pulling their own weight, our lax bankruptcy system doesn't even ask people to consider paying what they owe, particularly when they have the ability to pay. Such a system, obviously, contributes to the fray of the moral fiber of our Nation. Why pay your bills when you can walk away with no questions asked? Why honor your obligations when you can take the easy way out through bankruptcy? If we don't tighten the bankruptcy system, the moral erosion will certainly continue. The polls are very clear that the American people want the bankruptcy system tightened up. In my home State of Iowa, 78 percent of Iowans surveyed favor bankruptcy reform, and the picture is the same nationally. According to the Public Broadcasting System program Techno- Politics, almost 70 percent of Americans support bankruptcy reform. The American people seem to sense that the bankruptcy crisis is fundamentally a moral crisis. I have a chart that also deals with that. This chart is done by the Democratic polling firm of Penn &amp; Schoen. It talks about the perceptions people have about bankruptcy. You can see here that 84 percent of the people think that bankruptcy is more socially acceptable than it was a few years ago. This is the same polling firm President Clinton uses; so I think this number is very telling, given that it was produced by a liberal polling firm. In my State of Iowa, the editorial page of the Des Moines Register has summed up the problem that we have with the bankruptcy system by stating that bankruptcy ``was never intended as the one-stop, no-questions-asked solution to irresponsibility.'' I totally agree. I hope we can soon get to the bankruptcy bill, which has so much support in the Senate.

The estate or ``death'' tax has deviated from its original intent and purpose. From a practical sense, it was established to provide revenue on a short-term basis to finance military action. In theory, however, it was also viewed as a way to protect society against growing concentrations of wealth in the hands of a very few. Supposedly, this tax would encourage market growth which was hindered by the inheritance of estates. Well, the market has grown. Family-owned small businesses have become the backbone of our economy and continue to provide invaluable services. Recognizing their importance, programs were created to promote their existence and expansion in the form of loans and other assistance programs. Unfortunately, their lifespan is hindered by an unfair tax levied when ownership is transferred at the time of death. Less than 30 percent of all family-owned businesses survive through the second generation. This is unacceptable. The district I represent on Long Island, is dependent on the success of family-owned small businesses. A lot of hard work and determination is involved to secure their prosperity.

Last year, about this time, Senator Abraham and I submitted a bill to give a Congressional Gold Medal to Rosa Parks. That bill was passed in the Senate and the House, and the President presented it to her last summer in the Rotunda of the Capitol in a most remarkable ceremony. Rosa Parks, as most people know, was a native of Alabama, Tuskegee. She moved to Montgomery. She was a seamstress. She was riding on a bus one day, the bus was full and she was tired, and simply because of the color of her skin she was asked to go to the back of the bus and she refused and was arrested. That arrest commenced the Montgomery Alabama bus boycott over that rule, leading to a Federal court lawsuit that went to the Supreme Court, in which the Supreme Court held that kind of segregated public transportation was not legal and could not continue. The leader of that boycott turned out to be a young minister at Dexter Avenue Baptist Church by the name of Martin Luther King, Jr. The Federal judge who originally heard the case was Frank M. Johnson, Jr., one of the great Federal judges in civil rights in American history, as far as I am concerned. Fred Gray was an attorney involved. Mr. Fred Gray, one of the first black attorneys in Montgomery, told the story in his book ``Bus Ride To Justice.'' How little did they know that the events they started on that day in 1955 would commence a movement that has reverberated, not only in Montgomery, in Alabama, but throughout the United States and, in fact, throughout the world, to a claim for rights and freedom and equality--great ideals. Troy State University in Montgomery, a 3,000-student university, is building a museum and library on the very spot of this arrest. These funds will help create in that building a museum to Rosa Parks with an interactive video friendly to visitors and children about the story of what happened on that day and the importance of it. I thank the distinguished Senator from Washington for supporting us in this effort. I see Senator Bryan. Mr. President, I say to him, I had 15 minutes on an amendment I called up earlier. Would it be all right for me to go ahead? I have a time crisis.","word.count":419,"sep11":-1.19662921348315,"years":2000.66292134831,"days":2016,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.570638400290968,"Topic 2":0.166701538251113,"Topic 3":0.0172681502056023,"Topic 4":0.0235182954355337,"Topic 5":0.0726665027168755,"Topic 6":0.0129156393495264,"Topic 7":0.0143274777785579,"Topic 8":0.0301264262687973,"Topic 9":0.0813320018818703,"Topic 10":0.0105055678211563},{"id":"11020080000712","body":"Tim Walberg: Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and good friend from Arizona for the opportunity to speak tonight. I just came back from Iraq and Afghanistan this past week, and on the way back from Kabul to the airport, I looked out of our window of the vehicle we were riding in and I saw two young children running alongside the vehicle, as children will do, having fun together. They were racing each other and racing our vehicle. I looked in their eyes, and I saw nothing but what I would see in normal little children's eyes having fun, except these two young children had smudged faces and tattered clothes that they were playing in, in a war zone. And I thought to myself, these two little children could be just like a number of children we have read about, through the barbarism of individuals for a particular philosophy would have ammunitions strapped to them, and then, in a barbaric, gruesome way, their lives taken. On this day, the 35th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, we live in a civilized country, well educated, cleaned up, sanitized, and yet, because of a lie, there are innocent women, and indeed birth fathers, as well, who are caught in a lie and a trap that causes them to, in a sanitized way to some degree, yet the ultimate outcome is the same, to snuff out innocent lives for no reason that justifies that taking place. Today marks the 35th anniversary of Roe v. Wade. Since that time, nearly 50 million abortions have been performed. That is a staggering number which intensifies when we recognize each abortion consists of one innocent life snuffed out and at least one other life that is wounded. While I respect the fact that others may disagree, I believe that human life begins at conception. That means that almost 50 million lives have been extinguished since 1973. Because of Roe v. Wade, we have learned that a reckless majority on the Supreme Court can visit untold destruction and pain on us as a Nation if they search for results in individual cases that are outside the scope and text of the history of the Constitution. We have learned that the activist justices can find ``penumbras, formed by emanations'' in the Bill of Rights as a basis for establishing new constitutional rights that are not found anywhere in the text or history of the Constitution, as Justice Douglas ridiculously claimed in the case of Griswold v. Connecticut, a precedent for Roe v. Wade. Sadly, unelected activist judges with lifetime appointments continue to make law rather than to apply the law as it is written. As elected officials, it is our right to make law, and it certainly is not the right of judges and justices to do so. Rather, they must follow the law as we, the accountable decision makers, have written it. We have engaged in a long struggle and must continue in that struggle to ensure that the Supreme Court and our lower Federal courts are stocked with people who abide by the text and the history of the Constitution instead of acting as super-legislators in making new law. Mr. Speaker, today, on the 35th anniversary of that tragic ruling, my heart is grieved; yet, it is heartened. Though we mourn for lives that could have been, we see significant progress in the fight to defend human life. Just today, a bipartisan majority in the Michigan Senate voted to ban partial birth abortion. Abortions have declined by nearly 20 percent in the past 15 years, and every year Americans have become increasingly pro-life. I, along with millions of Americans, remain committed to saving the unborn and upholding the right to life our Nation was founded upon. Perhaps the tide is finally turning. I also call, Mr. Speaker, for an all-out effort of compassion for the women and the birth fathers who have been caught in the lie of abortion and have had their lives altered. A loving God offers forgiveness and hope and healing, and we, His people, can offer no less. I pledge to continue to work every day to bring back the sanctity of life to our Nation. And it is heartening to stand here with my colleagues tonight and with hundreds of thousands of individuals today on the Mall and speak for life.","word.count":727,"sep11":6.52808988764045,"years":2008.38764044944,"days":4766,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.00730667930207626,"Topic 2":0.253355126086287,"Topic 3":0.00555466111128132,"Topic 4":0.290547780050121,"Topic 5":0.00299315095369138,"Topic 6":0.00204961588943137,"Topic 7":0.00705984978733306,"Topic 8":0.0045012100579226,"Topic 9":0.394127157832428,"Topic 10":0.032504768929428},{"id":"10920050073781","body":"Christopher Dodd: Madam President, I said about $100 million. The idea is just, if we can, to get these levels of support and funding up because of the rising costs of running these programs. Energy costs are going up on the average in Head Start Programs by 15 percent. Transportation costs are going up 16 percent. Health insurance in some places has gone up as high as 25 percent. Training for staff is up 4 percent. Facility maintenance is up 9 percent. Services for children with special needs, of course, continues to rise. This amendment does not expand the program. It is not going to add 100,000 children to the Head Start Program. It is just designed to make sure that we do not see the program deteriorate, that we do not force children presently in the program to be dropped because we are unable to meet the predictable inflationary costs of about 2.7 percent in Head Start Programs across the country. That is the rationale for it. It is not an excessive amendment at all. It is a realistic effort to try to do what we can to see to it that these children are going to get the kind of start they deserve. To make my case, I want to point out two studies. One was done a number of years ago. It was a survey done of kindergarten teachers throughout the United States. These were asked, How ready are children when they come to kindergarten? How ready are they to learn? Over 50 percent of kindergarten teachers in the United States, when surveyed and asked that question, responded that the majority of children were not ready to learn when they entered kindergarten. There are a variety of reasons for that. We are not going to solve the problem overnight. But we do know now, after 40 years, that children who are in a Head Start Program clearly benefit and have a much higher degree of success than children in similar circumstances who do not participate in programs. We know, for instance, that Head Start children are more likely to maintain grade level performance in elementary schools and on into secondary schools. We know that Head Start children stay out of the juvenile justice system to a far higher degree than children who are not in those programs. We know that children in the Head Start Program are less likely to become abusers of substances, either alcohol or drugs. We know these children, who are involved in Head Start Programs are less likely to become teen mothers. In statistic after statistic, we find these children who get the benefit and advantages of a Head Start Program have a greater likelihood of success. It is not a guarantee of success. There are obviously children who do not make it. But we know after 40 years this program works pretty well. Again, I am not suggesting today we expand the program. I have tried that in the past. All I am asking my colleagues today is to say for the coming fiscal year can we do what is possible to avoid some 20,000 children who are presently in the program from falling out of it? The second study I want to point out has just come out in the last several days. I do not know if my colleagues have yet received these in their offices. My colleagues, Senator Lamar Alexander and Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, went to the National Academy of Sciences a couple of months ago. If I can paraphrase their request, they said to the National Academy of Sciences: Would you mind telling us, over the next number of years, what are the 10 things we ought to better prepare to handle the math, the science, and the technology demands of our Nation? I am not going to recite the full study here, which is entitled ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm.'' I will just list some of the authors. The chair is Norman Augustine, the retired chair of Lockheed Martin; Craig Barrett, chairman of the board of Intel Corporation; Rick Levin, the president of Yale University; the president of MIT, the president of DuPont company, the president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute--it is just an incredible list of distinguished Americans and academicians who worked over a period of time, I think 3 or 4 months, to come out with a series of recommendations. I will not go through all of their report. You will get it and it is worth looking at. There were some very dramatic recommendations and ones we should take very seriously. Their findings come in this smaller pamphlet entitled ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm.'' In the first paragraph, these distinguished Americans say: It continues, but I think that language directly bears on the amendment I am offering today. The No. 1 suggestion they make--I don't think they necessarily prioritize it, but the first suggestion is to train and put into the field 10,000 teachers a year in math and the sciences. The goal is that each one of these teachers might educate 1,000 students over a career, so that over time a million students in our country would benefit from a tremendous education in science and math and engineering. If America is going to avoid exactly what these distinguished Americans have warned us against we must prepare teachers and children. Let me go back to the statistic I mentioned a moment ago, that if the kindergarten teachers of America are right, half of children entering kindergarten today are not ready to learn. It is one thing to have teachers, but what if you don't have the students who are ready to learn? If we know that Head Start kids are more likely to be prepared for school, stay in school, stay out of trouble, avoid substance abuse, don't become teen parents, then we ought to be doing what we can to keep those 900,000 kids in the program. We know full well that Head Start, after 40 years, does make a difference. We can do a lot better. We can do so much better if we start making these modest investments. We know the modest investments in these programs pay huge dividends. Should we not try to stop some erosion in this program? That is all I am offering today, a modest 2.7-percent increase, a little more than $150 million to just keep the number of children in the program there for the coming fiscal year. Then, I hope, in the coming years when our fiscal condition is much stronger and better certainly than it is today, we can do more to see that these children have a chance to go on. Someday I want to come back and offer an amendment again, as I did years ago, to make sure every eligible child can get in a good program like Head Start and Early Head Start. I wouldn't try that today. I know my colleagues cannot accept that. I understand the budget realities. But can we not find $153 million? We are spending $6 billion a month in Iraq. That doesn't include Afghanistan. My colleague from Tennessee and I and Senator Enzi and Senator Kennedy recently worked on a package for 1 year to help out some 400,000 students who have lost their schools as a result of Katrina and Rita--mostly Katrina. It was a great idea. Let's put aside our differences. Let's make sure these kids can get going so they do not miss a year because the schools have been washed away or destroyed. But there are not hurricanes and natural disasters all over our country, thank the Lord. But these children in Head Start, in many ways, live in a disastrous situation every day. They live in chaos, many of them. They live in families and neighborhoods where it is amazing that anyone can come out of them intact. Head Start has reached into these communities and provided a safe place, a harbor for children with talents and abilities. If you go to a Head Start Program you see the children are bright and they want to learn and they overcome obstacles, as their parents do every day, to give them a chance to get going. I don't want some kid in a Head Start Program to be dropped out this year who could have become that engineer or that scientist who becomes that CEO of Intel or who becomes the head of Lockheed Martin or becomes the president of RPI or Yale University. And they are there. These kids are not just in the private schools. They are not just in the affluent neighborhoods. Talented Americans are in every neighborhood in America, and we ought to be able to do better for these children. We ought to be able to say: This year things are tough, we can't expand the program. But we are not going to lose any kids. We are not going to leave any child behind in a Head Start Program. Listen to the warnings of this report. It can happen with abruptness, and once lost, very difficult to regain. So while we expand the pool of teachers, while we do everything we can to give kids a chance to learn, we have to make sure these kids are ready to learn. Head Start, for 40 years has done that. It has made it possible for kids to become ready to learn. Not that they make it in every case, again, but we know without any question today that the difference between a child who is in an Early Head Start or Head Start Program and a child who is not is the likelihood the Head Start participant will avoid the obvious pitfalls that can happen so quickly in a young person's life. There is a greater likelihood they will go through it. I am offering this amendment today, pleading with my colleagues, let's not lose 20,000 kids. We have not yet even begun to discuss this ``Rising Storm'' report. I like big ideas, and one of the reasons I am so fond of my colleague from Tennessee is because he likes big ideas. He wanted to come to the Senate to grapple with a big idea, and this is a big idea. I am sure he has not, nor am I, endorsing every dotted I or crossed t here. But it is a very big idea. Head Start is a big idea that Ed Zigler had 40 years ago, and today there are some 900,000 children in this country who benefit from it, less than 50% of those who are eligible. It is a big idea that needs to be protected. We need to be thinking about both parts of the equation--we need teachers and we need students. We can do a lot better, in my view, if we try to do both. We are not going to deal with this report this year. But it seems to me we know He","word.count":2345,"sep11":4.23033707865169,"years":2006.08988764045,"days":3948,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.622493983178536,"Topic 2":0.0167405884313819,"Topic 3":0.0131435269234726,"Topic 4":0.0115243819137714,"Topic 5":0.0408930141857816,"Topic 6":0.0493418678839247,"Topic 7":0.00378827232922452,"Topic 8":0.231321758588631,"Topic 9":0.00503670658804401,"Topic 10":0.00571589997723283},{"id":"10419960004128","body":"Gerald B.H.

But instead, Jefferson turned to the writings of Blackstone and Locke. Ms. Blackstone, the great jurist of England, examined the laws of England and laid them side by side with the biblical statements to come up with something called the Doctrine of Natural Law. And Blackstone said, When the supreme being formed the universe and created matter out of nothing, he impressed certain principles upon that matter from which it could never depart, without which it would cease to be. This will of a Maker is called the Law of Nature for as God, when he created matter and did it with a principle of mobility, established certain rules for the perpetual direction of that motion so when he created man and indued him with free will to conduct himself in all parts of life, he laid down certain immutable laws of human nature. Considering the Creator only as a being of infinite power, he was able unquestionably to prescribe whatever laws he placed to his creature, man, whoever unfit or severe. But as he is also a being of infinite wisdom, he has laid down only such laws as were founded in those relations of justice. These are the quotes of Blackstone. It was the thoughts of Blackstone, in fact many of the words that were incorporated directly into the Declaration of Independence, and that great document set forth not only our severance from Great Britain, but also a statement as to the source of laws in this country that God is the source of liberty, that man is given the power to form governments for the purpose of protecting those rights that God gives. Jefferson took that knowledge, sat down, inscribed that into the Declaration, and that's what forms the basis of the law of America. It's the law of nature and of nature's God.","word.count":367,"sep11":6.94101123595506,"years":2008.80056179775,"days":4913,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0773980203283242,"Topic 2":0.0460893560079837,"Topic 3":0.298280501513132,"Topic 4":0.045302546946949,"Topic 5":0.010112212718706,"Topic 6":0.211243048261194,"Topic 7":0.00865235638606735,"Topic 8":0.272731493731299,"Topic 9":0.0237358635339917,"Topic 10":0.00645460057235145},{"id":"11020080007928","body":"Thelma D.

Since the 104th Congress was sworn into office a year and a half ago, we have debated the issue of how best to provide for our children's education. That is good. We need discourse and hotly contested ideas from both side of the aisle if we are to forge a bipartisan, hopefully even a nonpartisan plan for ensuring that every American has the education necessary to not just survive, but to succeed in a global economy. But, Mr. Speaker, we cannot have that needed discourse while the debate is fraught with distortions and political rhetoric, and that is where we find ourselves today. So I would like to begin by reviewing exactly what educational reforms have been passed by this House over the last 18 months. Under the Balanced Budget Act, total student loan volume was scheduled to grow from last year's $24 to $36 billion in 2002. That's a 50-percent growth in spending. The school lunch program was approved for a 36-percent increase over the same period, with the States allowed to run their lunchrooms without Federal interference for the first time in decades. The maximum annual Pell grant amount for low-income college students was raised to the highest level in history at $2,400 per student. The House approved sweeping, and long-needed reforms in the way interest is calculated on some of the loans. Under the proposed changes, no student would have paid any interest on their loans while they were still in school. But graduate students would have been required to pay back the interest that accrued on their loans while they were getting their graduate degrees, after they graduated and got jobs. At present, working-class Americans are forced to subsidize that accrued interest for doctors, lawyers, and Ph.D. recipients. It is just not right for someone earning minimum wage to be paying the loan cost for someone earning six-figures. The budget we passed last year would have put an end to the practice, and saved our children $10 billion they would not have had to pay back with interest. The demagogs in Congress call this cutting. As to the Direct Loan Program, the budget would have brought that to a halt. Since the very inception of Federal student aid, loans have successfully been processed through private lenders. It is amazing that while the Federal Government is doing everything possible to downsize and privatize, and the President himself tells us that the era of big Government is over in his State of the Union Address, the Clinton administration continues to launch new big government programs, seeking to federalize what is now in the private sector. The education plan that passed this House last year would have made the same student loans available from the same sources as they have been for the past 30 years. For those who love to cry out against mean-spirited Republican cuts, I'm proud to say that although there was absolutely not one nickle of cuts in overall spending, there were, indeed cuts in areas that badly needed cutting. The Head Start Program was slated for a true 4-percent reduction in funding, which is well warranted, according to Head Start Founder Edward Zeigler, who I quote: Indeed, over the last 6 years, Head Start enrollment has grown by 39 percent, while spending has increased 186 percent. That kind of out-of- control spending has to stop, and the plan we passed would have brought it to a screeching halt. There were also real cuts in spending for the U.S. Department of Education, which would have taken an 11 percent reduction in funding. Since it was created in 1979, the Department of Education has spent $342 billion without any evidence the money has improved education in any way. Even the liberal Washington Post wrote in a December editorial: ``America's schools are not noticeably better because a Department of Education was created.'' Why hasn't the Department of Education helped improve our children's education? Because of simple economics--you cannot take money from taxpayers across the country, send it to Washington, DC, then send it back to the States, and not lose most of the original money in the process. According to the Congressional Research Service, of every dollar we send to the Department of Education here in Washington, only 23 cents ever finds it's way back to our local schools. That's not efficient, and that's not how to compete in a global economy. Now, there is one program that is eliminated entirely under the balanced budget plan--Goals 2000. That program has skyrocketed in cost from $87 to $372 million in just 1 year. It duplicates other Federal efforts, creates a multitude of new bureaucracies, but has no real impact on day-to-day learning. And the attempts of the program to revise American history to reflect the new politically correct themes of the far-left have been so inflammatory they were voted down in the Senate by a 99-to-1 vote. So the new plan contained not one penny for Goals 2000. The defenders of the failed status-quo in education have tried to convince the American people that Republicans would undermine education by holding down the massive spending increases that the Clinton administration had planned. But maybe they should instead answer the question of why we should spend more taxpayer money when our Federal dollars have failed to achieve positive results, year after year after year. This plan to bring our educational efforts into line with our ability to fund them, and with the level of achievement of our programs, now sits in limbo, vetoed by the President. But the educational reforms in the Balanced Budget Act are not the only efforts undertaken by this Congress to improve the way our children learn. A major battle in the effort took place just this spring here in Washington, and most of the Nation missed it. It was the latest round in the fight over who has the ultimate authority over a child's education and future--the parent or the Federal Government. This House provided funds for Washington's public schools to offer a small pilot school choice program, that would allow about 2 percent of all Washington, DC, school children to attend better schools, and then only if local school board members choose to use the plan. For those students locked into attendance at the worst public schools in the District, vouchers would be provided to pay for transportation to alternate public schools, or for transportation and tuition at private schools. The program, similar to one in Milwaukee and nearly two dozen other communities, was designed to give poor parents the same power and freedom of education that rich parents have. It would have improved public schools by making them compete for students, and most importantly, by giving students the opportunity for a better quality education. Unfortunately, there are those here inside-the-beltway who are adamantly opposed to fairness and equality of opportunity. After stalling the D.C. budget for months over this single issue, liberal Senate Democrats under pressure from President Bill Clinton voted to filibuster the bill, which prevented it from even coming to the floor for a vote. The White House announced it would have vetoed the entire bill over this tiny pilot project, even though the District's local political leaders begged for passage. The White House, liberal Senate Democrats, and the NEA won, and Washington's schoolchildren lost. Why the extraordinary fight over a program that could at most impact only 2 percent of students in a single school district? Because the National Education Association decided to make this a litmus test. Their chief lobbyist told the Washington Post on February 28 that ``It is much bigger than D.C.'' And when Washington's NEA office says ``jump,'' the Washington bureaucracy says ``how high?'' The reason, as U.S. News and World Report recently explained, is that--and I quote: According to the Education Policy Institute, NEA and its related educational PAC's spend $40 million a year on the national level lobbying for their agenda, 98 percent of which goes to Democrats. And with a total budget of $1.2 billion a year, the amount of overall political impact this special interest exerts on our children's education is beyond measure. What these objections are really over is not the education of children. It is over the billions spent every year on Federal allocations for education programs at dozens of Federal agencies. And billions ultimately find their way, directly and indirectly, into the coffers of the NEA and their members. The greatest fear of the NEA is that granting freedom to families to choose where their child is educated will cut off the flow of those funds, and their ability to control the educational agenda of the Nation. As long as the liberal trend towards federalization of our local schools continue, the NEA's feast on largesse at the Federal trough will continue. Any increase in parental or local control of those funds stands diametrically opposed to their goal of dominating the educational industry. However, a clarification of how this debate is currently framed is badly needed. Those on both sides of the issue of school choice often make the same mistake. It is not an issue of public versus private education. It is a question of how to provide the best education possible for every child in this country. As we face the educational challenges facing us in an era of global competition, we can no longer afford the illusion that we have competing school systems. We have one educational system in America, and it includes public, private, and home schooling, and we have to maintain the openmindedness to rethink our approach on a child-by-child level. For most of our Nation's children, public education provides a quality learning","word.count":116,"sep11":-6.46629213483146,"years":1995.39325842697,"days":140,"party":"Other","chamber":"","Topic 1":0.188716740174085,"Topic 2":0.446372103991703,"Topic 3":0.00916392355383081,"Topic 4":0.0156657991278018,"Topic 5":0.0104697686290775,"Topic 6":0.00995649479894836,"Topic 7":0.163228097538836,"Topic 8":0.0316056956220299,"Topic 9":0.118620766813596,"Topic 10":0.00620060975009174},{"id":"10620000013808","body":"James Greenwood: Mr. Speaker, I have the pleasure today of hosting an organization of young people in from my district who call themselves ``What If?'' What if young people knew how to create their future every day through the goals they set and the decisions they make? What if today's youth were given opportunities to become team members, to solve problems and to resolve differences clearly and effectively? What if the youth of today created an expectation for leadership and accountability, and in doing so, create a shift in the way they view themselves and the way they are viewed by others? What if a generation, this generation, decided to empower itself by giving itself a meaningful name, the Possibility Generation? What if the mass youth movement to spread that name around the globe taught participants in that movement to produce actions founded on choice, personal and social empowerment, integrity, and responsibility? In a world where young people feel that the road ahead is so bleak as to require dramatic and violent means of self-expression, in a fast- paced world of uncertainty and change greater than any other time in history, we must empower youth to become visionaries, and to invite new choices for their future, to make responsible choices, and to take responsibility for the choices that they make. In a world in which the mere sustainability of our planet cannot be taken for granted, we must encourage and produce socially, environmentally, politically, and commercially conscious youth leadership. The What If Organization, founded to address these very issues, is an an educational, training, and networking organization which provides unique emotional and intellectual development through innovative programs that train youth and young adults to become productive in the workplace, in their lives, and in their communities. The skills acquired through What If interactive programs provide long- term solutions with broad implications by training students to make responsible choices and consciously operate as the CEOs of their lives. Youth leaders of the What If organization have renamed their generation. Formerly known as Generation Y, the Possibility Generation. They are creating history as the first generation to name itself, and through that act, they are declaring their leadership. Unwilling to be labeled by others, these youth are creating a shift in the way they view themselves and the way they are viewed by others. Representatives of the What If Organization, founders of the Possibility Generation, and their peers are here today to share in the creation of new possibilities for generations to come. As I read the Possibility Generation, written by these young people,. ``The Possibility Generation Proclamation: We, the youth and leaders of the future, hereby proclaim our self- fulfilling right to choose our name, to be accountable for how we are perceived, and to be responsible for the manner in which we relate to ourselves and others. We are shaping our future by naming ourselves the Possibility Generation, a name consistent with the future we are creating. We are actively forming the Possibility Generation by taking ownership of the future today. We know through our own initiative we can design our lives and future, building on the knowledge and experiences from previous generations. We willingly seek partnership in creating our future based on the recognition of our unlimited possibilities and what we can accomplish by virtue of our strengths, our openness, our quest to explore uncharted territory, our willingness to accept and to be proud of who we are, and our ability to accept others for who they are. We commit to being a model for the generations to follow, thus creating a future for our children and providing a choice to lead a life by a path of self-determination and celebration. We commit to creating a world that accepts all people and provides an equal right to explore given potential. In so doing, we become the possibility of goodness, peace, and humanitarianism for all. We, the members of the Possibility Generation, pledge to each live our possibilities in the manner that will empower us as individuals and thus positively influence society as a whole.'' I am delighted, Mr. Speaker, to host this group of fine young people in Washington today, where they will meet leaders from our Congress and from the administration, and wish them well as they take on these glorious endeavors.","word.count":722,"sep11":-1.33707865168539,"years":2000.52247191011,"days":1966,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.662390027288369,"Topic 2":0.277989070444184,"Topic 3":0.00540399795926215,"Topic 4":0.0161734922234516,"Topic 5":0.00938030490119114,"Topic 6":0.00472502914542776,"Topic 7":0.00576699519146377,"Topic 8":0.00593592275279088,"Topic 9":0.00871223901117314,"Topic 10":0.00352292108268642},{"id":"10920060055929","body":"Kenneth Salazar: Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the question currently before the Senate regarding whether to allow Federal funding for embryonic stem cell research. It is clear from the last 2 days of debate in the Senate that people on both sides of this issue have very strong feelings about their positions, and rightly so. This is an extremely important issue that raises a whole host of questions to which there are no easy answers. On one hand, we must consider the fundamental question of how to treat potential human life. On the other, we must consider the vast potential of a scientific field that could greatly improve millions of actual human lives and save millions more. When the stakes are this high, we are obligated to have an honest, open, and thorough debate. In keeping with the gravity of these questions and the potential ramifications of how we answer them, I believe that both the Government and the scientific community should address them responsibly. Like millions of other American families, my family has been touched by the ache of loss brought about by Alzheimer's disease. My father died of complications only a few years ago. At the end of his life, I wanted nothing more than to be able to help ease his suffering. Now, as I reflect on that difficult time, I think of the families that are currently enduring the same pain mine did, and I want to help them. I trust the vast majority of the scientific community that believes embryonic stem cell research may hold the key to the cures these families are seeking. I also believe that our Government can work to promote this science responsibly by paving the way for treatments that will save millions of lives without destroying others. Toward that end, I believe the legislation passed by the House represents a measured, responsible step toward tapping into the vast potential that embryonic stem cell research has with respect to finding cures for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, diabetes, and a wide range of other devastating diseases. In millions of cases, H.R. 810 could mean the difference between a normal life and one of pain and suffering. In millions of other cases, it could mean the difference between life and death. By authorizing Federal funding only for research on embryonic stem cells that will never become human life and that are donated willingly, it achieves its objectives without destroying the potential for life. To be sure, support from private funds for this research has been welcome. But it is not enough. I have heard from scores of scientists in my home State of Colorado--working in university labs as we speak, trying to find cures for our most devastating diseases--who tell me that the Federal funding H.R. 810 would authorize would boost their capabilities exponentially. In addition to the practical impact on American laboratories, however, there is something else to consider. I can think of no other Nation that should lead this research with strict guidelines than the United States. Throughout our Nation's history, America has been the leader in making monumental scientific strides--on everything from cars to computers to medicine--that have made life easier and better for people in our country and all over the world. In a field with such great promise, I believe we owe it to our history and to our position in the world community to once again be the leader. I want to be clear that I also believe we should promote research on adult umbilical cord stem cells, as well as alternative methods of creating embryonic stem cells. In addition, we should do everything in our power to prevent unethical and repulsive practices from pervading this kind of research. For that reason, I strongly support the other two proposals that are currently before the Senate, S. 2754 and S. 3504. As I make these remarks today, I think once again of my father. I also think of other fathers, mothers, brothers, and sisters across this great Nation who live every day with debilitating conditions that stem cell research could help cure. Suffering that could be stopped. Lives that could be saved. Families that could stay together. We have an opportunity to make great strides on these fronts today and to do so responsibly. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 810.","word.count":722,"sep11":4.9747191011236,"years":2006.83426966292,"days":4213,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0462745534144754,"Topic 2":0.0244908233752535,"Topic 3":0.00867153991634457,"Topic 4":0.0100166667452337,"Topic 5":0.00175488063875621,"Topic 6":0.0558335636814418,"Topic 7":0.281810389631626,"Topic 8":0.00674112322496528,"Topic 9":0.562811172193775,"Topic 10":0.00159528717812794},{"id":"11020070075084","body":"James M. Inhofe: Mr. President, last year I said that this Nation of immigrants requires an official language. An overwhelming majority of the Senate agreed with me on my amendment to that effect on the immigration bill. I am convinced that official English will command another majority should it receive a rollcall vote in this session. That is why today I am introducing S. 1335 to make English the official language of our Nation. The English language has played a critical role in establishing the unity of this Nation from its beginning. As I have said before, a common means of communication has created one giant market for goods and labor in our Nation, from Maine to California. A resident of Tulsa can seek work in New Hampshire, Oregon, or Georgia without having to learn a second language. A company based in Oklahoma City can readily sell its products from Portland, ME, to Los Angeles. In Europe, by contrast, a resident of Berlin cannot look for work in Paris or Warsaw without surmounting considerable language barriers. A German company cannot usually sell its product in Madrid, again, in part, because of language barriers. The European Union is an effort to create a U.S.-like common market in Western Europe. Among other things, Europeans are spending billions of euros to try to replicate what we in America have enjoyed for free these past 230 years. Recognizing that English is necessary for successful business and a growing economy, the Santa Ana Chamber of Commerce recently announced that it is spearheading a multimillion dollar campaign to help about 50,000 of its residents to learn the language. I regret to report that we have spent the last few decades giving away this priceless linguistic unity. Clinton Executive Order No. 13166 demands that all recipients of Federal funds function in any language anyone speaks at any time, burdening taxpayers with extraneous costs of an enabling policy while providing incentives for immigrants to circumvent learning English and, regretfully, hurt their chances at effective assimilation. My constituents agree that foreign language ballots deserve no place in an American election. My bill will eliminate these foreign language voting materials and multilingual voting mandates imposed on Oklahoma and other States. Only citizens are allowed to vote in our Nation, and one of the requirements to become a good citizen is to show an understanding of English. Money to provide foreign language ballots would be better spent on such constructive activities as simply teaching people how to speak English. Not only does my bill repeal foreign language ballots, it is aimed at the entire forest of mandatory multilingualism. My legislation basically recognizes the practical reality of the role of English as our official language and states explicitly that English is our official language and provides English a status in law it has not held before. Making English the official language will clarify that there is no entitlement to receive Federal documents and services in languages other than English and will end the practice of providing translation entitlements at taxpayer expense. My bill declares that any rights of a person, as well as services or materials in languages other than English, must be authorized or provided by law. It recognizes the decades of unbroken court opinions that civil rights laws protecting against national origin and discrimination do not create rights to government service and materials in languages other than English. While my bill will end federally mandated and funded foreign language entitlement, it certainly still allows for Democratic and Republican activists to offer palm cards and sample ballots in any language they wish--from Cherokee to Chinese--on election day and for individuals to bring along their own translaters to any Federal Government office. It is important to note that my bill only affects the language spoken by the Government, not the language choices of people speaking among themselves. Official English is popular even among Hispanics. As I have cited before on the floor of the Senate, in 2006, a Zogby poll found 84 percent of Americans, including 71 percent of Hispanics, believe that English should be the national language of government operations. According to a 2002 Kaiser Family Foundation survey, a poll of 91 percent of foreign-born Latino immigrants agreed that learning English is essential to succeed in the United States. Allow me to conclude by remembering the founder of the official English movement, U.S. Senator S.I. Hayakawa. The son of Asian immigrants, S.I. Hayakawa became a professor of English, a college president, and, in 1976, a U.S. Senator. Senator Hayakawa became the leader of the official English effort in this Chamber when he introduced an official English bill on April 27, 1981. Senator Hayakawa used to say ``bilingualism for the individual is fine but not for a country.'' While I never served with Senator Hayakawa, I would like to honor his efforts and continue his important work by offering the S.I. Hayakawa Official English Act of 2007, which is S. 1335. Let me say, it seems so ridiculous that as we travel around the world, there are some 51 countries that have English as their official language, and yet the United States doesn't. I was recently in Ghana, West Africa. They have English as their official language. We don't have it in the United States. Zambia, Uganda, and Zimbabwe have English as their official language but not the United States. This is something that should be a no- brainer. Of the 80-some percent of the people polled, up to 91 percent want English as the official language, and yet, for some unknown reason, people seem to be catering to some maybe small, radical group that doesn't want it. I think it is time for the majority of the American people to realize this could very well be the reality. Let me also say, when I had this amendment on the floor before, there were all kinds of objections that came down that didn't have any credibility at all. One of them that came down said: Well, you have all these flags of the various States that have foreign languages; you would have to do away with State flags. This has nothing to do with that. One came down that said: You would no longer be able to use Spanish on the floor of the Senate. It has nothing to do with that. They said: You would be drowning Hispanics. I said: Explain that to me. They said: Well, we have ``no swimming'' signs in the Potomac where the currents are very strong, so people would go in there and they would drown. This is how desperate people are to find something objectionable about something that 90 percent of the people in America want. So we are very serious about this. We are going to carry on the works of the good Senator from California and hopefully respond to 90 percent of Americans who want English as an official language. S. 1336.

When we are in prolonged debate, one could say everything has been said. We go on because everyone has not yet said it. Nevertheless, this is an issue that is very important, and we do need to have a process in which the issue will be brought fairly to the Senate for the Senate to act upon. Let me talk just a little bit in more general terms. The gentleman from Indiana has spelled out very eloquently and very completely the detail of a line-item veto. It is not a new issue. It has been talked about for years. It was talked about, as a matter of fact, in developing the Constitution. Many constitutional scholars from time to time have argued that there is no need for a line-item veto; that, in fact, the language of the Constitution provides that. Unfortunately, the Court has never agreed to that idea even though it clearly does give the President the opportunity to return bills to the Congress. So it is not a new issue. Neither is it a new issue in terms of having been tried. It is done in many States. It is done in my State of Wyoming, and done very successfully, I might add. From time to time, the legislature overrides the Governor's veto. More often, I suppose, they do not. I suspect that that is an indication that that element of the bill should not have prevailed. We are really here to talk about change: change in procedure and change in structure, structure in the operation of Congress, that will result in changes in the product of Congress. I think the most compelling truism is that if we as citizens have not been happy with the performance of Congress over time we cannot expect any different results if we continue to do the same thing. If there was one clear message that came, certainly, from this past election, it was that people wanted change, wanted structural change, wanted procedural change. Now we have an opportunity in this Congress for the first time in a very long time, an opportunity to rethink some things, an opportunity to look at new ideas, an opportunity to actually do some of the things that have been talked about for a very long time. There is reason to do that. We have had a history in recent years of continuing to simply do the same thing, and the Congress would appropriate more money to show that, if we had more money, we could cause it to happen. The fact is, that many of the programs have failed, are failing. Welfare--welfare is not doing the thing that it is designed to do. Welfare is designed to provide help for the needy, to help them get back into the marketplace. It is not doing that. How many years have we had a war on poverty? And the fact is that poverty is more prominent now than it was when we started the war. These programs are failing. Financial responsibility--certainly one cannot look at the size of Government, one cannot look at the deficit and suggest that the effort for financial responsibility has been successful. It has not. Pork barrel? Of course, we have pork barrel. So we need structural changes, and this is one of them. There were several and they are talked about often because I think they are very important and should, indeed, be talked about: Balanced budget amendment, the proper thing to do. And really, there are a lot of details one can go through but you really start with the basic question. In that instance, the question is, Is it morally right, is it fiscally right to balance the budget, to not spend more in outlays than you take in, in revenues? And the answer is almost unanimously yes, of course, it is right. Then you deal with the issue of how do you accomplish it, how do you get there. Unfunded mandates--something that has been needed for a very long time--has finally been accomplished, not as thoroughly as some would like, but, nevertheless, accomplished, and very important. If we are to begin to downsize Government and to begin to shift some of the responsibilities to States, there needs to be the protection against unfunded mandates. Accountability, it is almost unbelievable that the Congress had a bill saying Congress has to live under the same laws as everybody else. I cannot believe that has not always been true, but it has not. Line-item veto is a structural change that needs to take place. It is not going to balance the budget, of course, but what it is going to do is to change the way we look at budgeting. It is going to give the President--by the way, he is really the only political person that has a broad enough base to reach into bills and veto things that should not be there. I guess my greatest example is in the House, when we had a highway bill, a highway bill that everybody wanted to pass, of course, everybody wanted it so we could go forward with the highway program, and in it was the Lawrence Welk Museum, half a million dollars for the Lawrence Welk Museum. Never would it have passed on its own merits. Had it been an individual bill, it never would have passed, but we had no way to reach in and get it. I told that story, by the way, in a speech I made in North Dakota. That was the wrong place to do it. They were sort of excited about having that. In any event, we should have a way to deal with those, and that is what this is all about. So, Mr. President, there will be a great deal of discussion, and there should be. There will be a great deal of talk about details and alternatives, and there should be. There can be alternatives, but the fact is there is a principle involved here, and the principle is to change the structure so that we can have a line-item veto to help balance the approach to financing and to budgets. I rise in strong support for passage of a line-item veto.

Thanks to the leadership of the chairman of the committee, a fisheries component was included in this supplemental appropriations bill because the fisheries industry was truly devastated along the gulf coast.

The chairman's committee action would, in a general sense, remedy that. My amendment No. 3648 would tweak the language--again, not add or increase any dollars--so that that money could be used in part for the repairing of vessels in situations where those repair costs go beyond insurance proceeds available and other available funds.

His commitment to fairness and justice and peace set a standard for anybody who rubbed shoulders with him here in the House of Representatives and during his service on the city council of New York. Ted Weiss is fondly remembered as a man of gentleness and grace who represented the best in public service that was there to be offered. It is absolutely fitting and proper to honor Ted Weiss's civic contributions by designating the new courthouse in New York City as the Ted Weiss United States Courthouse. Mr. Speaker, I want to join with the gentleman from New York [Mr. Nadler] and all of those who have spoken on behalf of this legislation.","word.count":277,"sep11":-6.3061797752809,"years":1995.55337078652,"days":197,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0859075812336434,"Topic 2":0.419515393599933,"Topic 3":0.0663002990016799,"Topic 4":0.0186650003439814,"Topic 5":0.354848949489479,"Topic 6":0.00576863195581748,"Topic 7":0.00565413556310865,"Topic 8":0.0134688563367363,"Topic 9":0.00901894620513392,"Topic 10":0.0208522062704867},{"id":"11020070025635","body":"Adam H. Putnam: Mr. Speaker, I oppose this unfair rule and the underlying bill that makes a mockery of our Nation's Wild and Scenic River law. First, this rule unfairly restricts Members from being able to offer amendments on the House floor. It's not the first time. It's a continuing pattern that we have seen over and over and over again. While every Democrat amendment filed with the Rules Committee was made in order, this rule allows only two out of 15 Republican amendments to be offered on the floor. Seven attempts were made in the Rules Committee meeting on Monday to allow more amendments to be offered and to allow the House to consider the bill under an open rule allowing every Member of this body an opportunity to offer amendments on the House floor. Yet Democrats on the Rules Committee voted to block each and every attempt to allow a more open consideration of this bill. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle may attempt to argue that some of the amendments weren't allowed for technical reasons, but those excuses ring hollow, Mr. Speaker, when they block every single attempt to allow for a more open debate. Now, Mr. Speaker, to the underlying bill to designate the Taunton River in Massachusetts as a wild and scenic river. Mr. Speaker, I openly admit that I have never visited this river myself. But as they say, ``a picture is worth a thousand words.'' Mr. Speaker, I could say nothing at all, but a picture does say a thousand words. Here I have a photograph with me of a portion of this river that is anything but wild and scenic. Now, a simple glance at this photo would be enough for the House to just halt consideration of this legislation. Such a heavily developed and industrialized riverfront, with its multilane roadways, massive bridges and fuel storage tanks should disqualify, should disqualify this section of the river from being labeled wild and scenic. Now it's argued that the reason this portion is included is because it's ``recreational.'' Mr. Speaker, honestly, it's hard to imagine that one would choose to go swimming or enjoy a peaceful canoe trip through this portion of the river. Quite simply, this portion of the river simply should not be afforded among the highest environmental protections possible under Federal law by designating it as a wild and scenic river. Mr. Speaker, quite bluntly, if this qualifies, if this qualifies as a wild and scenic river under the intent of that statute, then downtown Manhattan can be a national forest and Six Flags can be a national park. This bill was scheduled to be considered by the House last week, yet it was postponed and rescheduled again for this week. This delay was caused when questions were raised that the true purpose of the bill, to name this river as wild and scenic, was to block a liquefied natural gas, or LNG, plant that has been proposed to be sited there. With record gas prices and high energy costs, Mr. Speaker, this is a serious question, because passage of this bill would block the proposed LNG plant from ever being built. Now my colleagues will argue, as they have already argued, that it already won't be built because the Coast Guard and others have raised objections and there are difficult hurdles under current law to overcome. However, the fundamental point is that today the law allows, the law allows today, for an LNG plant to be built if it can meet the necessary requirements. If it can't meet them right at this minute, then over time they may meet them. Or as the need for this energy becomes more apparent, then maybe the groundswell of support could allow this project to go forward. But if this law passes, Mr. Speaker, it will be impossible to build an LNG plant if this bill becomes law. So, Mr. Speaker, at a time when the liberal leaders of this House block any effort to increase energy production right here in America, when gas prices are skyrocketing and Americans are hurting, now is not the time, is not the time, to make energy more difficult to get or more expensive. Now the sponsor of this bill, Mr. Frank, testified before the Rules Committee on Monday. And Mr. McGovern in his remarks elaborated on this facility. He asked that the wishes of the Massachusetts delegation be respected in naming this a wild and scenic river because it only applies to them in Massachusetts. Well, Mr. Speaker, I must note with irony, with irony, that a request coming from the Massachusetts delegation to respect their wishes on this river, this bill, in opposition to this LNG plant. The argument is that this is in their backyard. And yet, Mr. Speaker, members of the Massachusetts delegation have repeatedly, repeatedly, voted to oppose the wishes of the Alaska delegation. On what you might ask? Well specifically on Alaska's wishes to develop the oil reserves in ANWR. Mr. Speaker, the folks of Massachusetts may have big backyards. But they don't stretch thousands of miles away to Alaska. We must recognize that if this industrial riverfront is permitted to be added to our Nation's wild and scenic rivers list, then truly all qualified rivers are diminished. This doesn't just affect Massachusetts. It affects every State in which there is a wild and scenic river. And in my home State of Washington, there are several. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule and oppose this bill. I reserve the balance of my time.","word.count":535,"sep11":5.89887640449438,"years":2007.75842696629,"days":4542,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.118473916748222,"Topic 2":0.0869716673082604,"Topic 3":0.012000408036017,"Topic 4":0.327348678398589,"Topic 5":0.0102517400878372,"Topic 6":0.00590980713827918,"Topic 7":0.317364641654439,"Topic 8":0.0771868582269279,"Topic 9":0.0347644449806487,"Topic 10":0.00972783742077991},{"id":"10419960010891","body":"John Conyers: Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute Mr. Speaker, the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Appropriations, the gentleman from Louisiana [Mr. Livingston], made some comments that need to be rebutted.

This measure calls for a modest amount of money--$450,000--to support the International Peace Garden. The International Peace Garden has been a proud monument to the history of good relations between the United States and Canada for many years. Canada contributes, the State of North Dakota contributes, and the Province of Manitoba contributes. There has been a history of Federal support, and now the Senator from Oklahoma, for some unknown reason, has picked out the International Peace Garden as something to eliminate from Federal support. This is a story from October of last year in the Minot Daily News, saying: ``Peace Garden Is In Need: Garden In Dire Need Of Money For Repairs, Operations.'' Why on earth the Senator from Oklahoma has picked on the International Peace Garden as something to eliminate leaves me scratching my head. This is a picture of the International Peace Garden. It is on the border between our country and Canada. It stands as testimony to the peaceful relations we have enjoyed on this border for our history. You can see in this photo these are absolutely beautiful gardens, with these memorial towers. This is the site of an international music camp that is conducted every year, which is world class. It is has attracted some of the world's greatest musicians. For some reason, the Senator from Oklahoma says none of this has any value. Let's just cut it all, eliminate all $450,000, which, I might say, is a modest amount of money in the context of an International Peace Garden. This is a monument on the grounds of the garden, which consists of girders from the World Trade Center. Our Governor and the Manitoba Premier were just here today to commemorate the 9/11 anniversary. The Senator from Oklahoma says this has no value. Sometimes things that are not a road or a bridge or a battleship have value. The International Peace Garden has value. The people of North Dakota provide money to support it. The people of Manitoba provide money to support it. The Government of Canada provides money to support it. I hope this body will reject the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma. Why is there any validity to saying there is no justification for Federal support for an international peace garden? I honestly don't know what argument the Senator from Oklahoma advances to say this has no value. Let me indicate where the International Peace Garden is. It is right here, almost equidistant between the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean. The International Peace Garden stands in the middle of my State of North Dakota in Dunseith. This is a headline, again from last year, in the Fargo Forum, the biggest newspaper in my State. It says: ``On the border of withering. The International Peace Garden supporters seek measures to keep alive iconic crossborder park.'' I have been at the International Peace Garden many times. It is an inspirational setting. It is something that I think anyone who visits the more than 2300 acres of--more than 2300 acres of the most spectacular gardens I have ever seen in my life anywhere in the world. Why the Senator from Oklahoma believes we ought to eliminate any Federal support for this peace garden that is dedicated to the extraordinary relationship we have had with our border to the North absolutely eludes me. For him to suggest this has no value, has he ever been there? Has he ever talked with the officials of Canada who have generously supported this institution? Has he talked with the people of Manitoba or the people of North Dakota? I am certain not because he would find in my State, which is a very conservative State, that there is very strong support for the International Peace Garden. This is a point of pride in our relations with our neighbors to the North. More than that, it sends a signal to the world about the value the American people put on peace. Do we have the strongest military in the world? Absolutely, and we are proud of it. Do we have the greatest economic strength of any country in the world? Yes, and we are proud of it. Do we lead in many areas in terms of human accomplishment, science, the arts? Absolutely, and we are proud of it. We also should send forth the signal that we are a country that believes in peace, and we strive for peace because that is part of the American character, too. And this International Peace Garden sends that message. It certainly sends that message to the people of Canada who are among our closest allies, who have stood with us in every crisis. Who, when the tragedy of 9/11 occurred, were the first people to our side? It was our neighbors to the North in Canada. This International Peace Garden, again more than 2300 acres of stunningly beautiful and inspirational gardens, stands as a memorial to that extraordinary relationship between our countries. Certainly, it is worth the expenditure of $450,000 to reinvigorate this symbol of respect. I urge my colleagues to reject the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.","word.count":893,"sep11":6.15449438202247,"years":2008.01404494382,"days":4633,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.356437453562599,"Topic 2":0.36335856685223,"Topic 3":0.194994714689925,"Topic 4":0.00928938525313655,"Topic 5":0.0183139077330174,"Topic 6":0.0116599722459038,"Topic 7":0.00327788657380101,"Topic 8":0.0294868713400251,"Topic 9":0.00743438922045123,"Topic 10":0.00574685252891165},{"id":"10519970081936","body":"Larry Craig: Mr. President, I would like to announce for the information of the Senate and the public that the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, will hold a hearing entitled ``The National Cancer Institute's Management of Radiation Studies.''

Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Georgia for his leadership on this most important issue. I believe that education is the most important issue facing our country. We have focused a majority of our attention on the need to give assistance to those of our students who are college bound, and that is important. We have done, I think, a good job in expanding, for example, the Pell grants to take in nearly 300,000 students, and I voted for that. We have increased the amounts of those grants substantially, from about $2,400 to $3,000 and I support that. And we worked to create educational savings accounts, and I think that is important, Madam President. But I think it is time that we look at our elementary schools and our high schools, because one in five third-graders across New York State could not read with comprehension even the easiest connected sentences and paragraphs, according to the New York State Department of Education. We have heard that 40 percent of the children in some of our school districts are reading below grade level and are below grade level in math. 50 percent-plus of the students in some of our school districts are dropping out of school, including here in the Nation's Capital. What is going to happen to those children who are dropping out? How can they compete? What jobs are they going to hold? What will happen to society if this continues? Let me say that last night the President talked about a number of issues. One of those issues he talked about was the need to hire more teachers. Let me tell you that I believe we need more teachers in the classrooms. We should empower, by way of making moneys available, the local districts to do exactly that. I am going to work with whoever it is--the President, this administration, my colleagues on both sides of the aisle--to do exactly that. The President also called for greater accountability in education, and I believe that's important. He said students must be more accountable for their performance, that we should not have social promotion. That is true. Unfortunately, we didn't hear one word about making teachers accountable also. One of the things that this bill, the B.O.O.K.S. Act, does is make available funds for accountability. You can't have our kids learning if the people teaching them do not meet performance standards. We must have competency testing so that we know math teachers do understand basic math and that they can teach it. We have to have some system of evaluating, and we should give the school districts that ability. It is not that we should say what test they should give, but we should empower the local districts and the parents to have a choice.  Mr. D'AMATO. Most of our teachers, I believe, Mr. President, do a great job and are dedicated and hard-working. Unfortunately, there is no financial reward for those great teachers. I think we need merit pay. That is one of the things that we encourage in this legislation, which offers better opportunities for our kids. We need major reform, not just tinkering at the edges of the problem. Let me touch on that which, in many cases, brings about a hue and cry not from the parents, but from those who want to protect the status quo, the teachers' union. By perpetuating the status quo, too many of our children are falling by the wayside--they are not making it. I am talking about a system that many of my colleagues quake when we bring the issue up, and that is called accountability and seeing to it that teachers don't have lifetime tenure. I think our kids are entitled to have teachers who make a difference just like the teachers I had in grade school who created magic in the classroom. Those teachers exist today. Let's understand that. I think the vast majority of our public school teachers are dedicated, work hard, do a good job, and they should be rewarded with merit pay. But, by gosh, let's not be afraid to say there should be accountability as well with teacher competency tests and ending a system where teachers, in essence, in too many of our schools and too many of our States, have what is likened to lifetime tenure. After 3 years, it becomes virtually impossible to remove those who are not doing the job. I will give you an example from New York State. Last year, only seven out of 200,000 teachers were removed. Seven. It has become virtually impossible. And it costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to bring this type of action. Now, Mr. President, I am not suggesting that we jeopardize those good teachers who are doing the job or that we create some arbitrary standards. I am suggesting that we have some review, some system to evaluate performance so that nobody has what is, in essence, lifetime tenure regardless of the job the person is doing. The education of our children is too important. Those who teach our children must be competent in these subjects, that is why we need competency testing for all teachers. Our children deserve nothing less. Let me point to just one other area before I conclude my remarks, and that is school safety. My gosh, if we have children in our public schools that say it is dangerous and they feel safer in their neighborhoods than going from one class to another, what more do we need? If we don't have schools as a safe haven, creating the environment where our children can learn in that safe haven, that oasis of learning, then how can the best teacher do the job? So we have to be able to fast-track violent, disruptive students out of the school. You cannot suggest that public education has ever said that even violent, disruptive juveniles have a right to stay in school no matter what their conduct. That is unfortunately the case in too many areas. I will tell you that the 1,116 schools in New York City reported 22,000 incidents in 1996-97, including nearly 5,000 person-related incidents. It becomes impossible to have serious learning in the classroom. Last but not least, let me just touch on one aspect that I think is so important. Why should we have a plethora of Federal programs that serve cross-purposes, when we can take that money and establish education block grants. Somehow bureaucrats have planted in the minds of many of our parents and local officials that they are going to lose money. What we call for in this bill is saying that we are going to give you the same amount of money, and, in fact, we will actually give you more money. In title II of the BOOKS Act, States would receive funds through block grants, which can be used for educational needs that the local communities and school boards think are important--not that Washington mandates. So they are going to get more money. In addition, they are going to get a lot more money because 95 percent of those funds must reach the local schools in the classrooms and cannot be used for administrative expenses. We cannot have 15 to as high as 25 and 30 percent of the money being used for administrative overhead. The money is not reaching the kids. I might give one example. Senator Gorton's amendment along these lines last year would have sent an additional $670 million to local school districts. But we have the bureaucrats in Washington who are opposed to that. They want to keep these ties. That is an employment center as opposed to becoming an educational opportunity. So $670 million more could go to the school districts. And by the way, that hires 26,000 teachers. So when our President says, ``we want to hire 100,000,'' here is a way. If we were to adopt the block grant proposal, and some amendments to it, we could hire as many as 26,000 teachers at the local districts without raising one additional penny. My gosh, that's over a quarter of the number that the President talked about, with no increase in taxes. It just means using the resources we have and empowering our parents and the local school districts to make these choices. Mr. President, I want to commend Senator Coverdell, Senator Lott, and the occupant of the Chair, Senator Coats, for being leaders in this area. We have to do better for our children, not just tinkering at the edges. By the way, why should we be afraid of the teachers' unions? We should encourage them to work with us. It should not be a battle against them. Notwithstanding that I have been critical of their status quo position and their opposition to basic, good, fundamental reform, this should be a fight for our children, to give our kids a better education. I would hope that the Members and all of the teachers would join and be in favor of this and work together. We can do better and we must do better because our children are entitled to that. So, Mr. President, I thank you for your leadership. I thank Senator Coverdell and my colleagues. I yield the floor.","word.count":1556,"sep11":-3.71348314606742,"years":1998.14606741573,"days":1120,"party":"Other","chamber":"","Topic 1":0.174824768960397,"Topic 2":0.103166261557607,"Topic 3":0.0054215949098726,"Topic 4":0.0155513346197159,"Topic 5":0.033347880629711,"Topic 6":0.00664169358094019,"Topic 7":0.552946305298756,"Topic 8":0.0323790922335119,"Topic 9":0.0727638349936613,"Topic 10":0.00295723321582707},{"id":"10720020004725","body":"John Boehner: Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 386, I call up the bill to amend title 1 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide additional protections to participants and beneficiaries in individual account plans from excessive investment in employer securities and to promote the provision of retirement investment advice to workers managing their retirement income assets, and to amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to prohibit insider trades during any suspension of the ability of plan participants or beneficiaries to direct investment away from equity securities of the plan sponsor, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.","word.count":110,"sep11":0.595505617977528,"years":2002.45505617978,"days":2654,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.746514949327888,"Topic 2":0.0844070894213396,"Topic 3":0.0183637780457605,"Topic 4":0.0390154274246368,"Topic 5":0.0187238754093806,"Topic 6":0.0175150798849644,"Topic 7":0.0146157205104219,"Topic 8":0.0319025652509988,"Topic 9":0.0203689196321107,"Topic 10":0.00857259509249873},{"id":"10419960076566","body":"James Jeffords: Mr. President, I rise to raise the awareness of the Senate as to the importance of being able to pass the D.C. appropriations bill today. The reason for that is that we have in this city a serious problem with the drinking water. And I will mention that in a little more detail in a moment. The bill is at the desk. It has passed the House. There is an appropriation in that bill to provide for immediate efforts to clean up the serious circumstances with the city's drinking water. I do not want to alarm anyone too much, but it is a health hazard to certain individuals who have immune problems as well as elderly people. In order to correct it, it is going to take some effort from private contractors, and it is going to take funds in order to contract with respect to certain pumps that may be broken in the efforts to flush the pumps out. In addition to that, we also have serious problems right now which need attention immediately, that is, we have public safety funds which have been increased in this bill. We have police cars right now on the blocks; we have fire engines in the shop and computer systems in chaos. There are funds in the bill which will allow us to do that and to get started immediately upon passage of the D.C. appropriations bill. Let me read to you from the report on the drinking water matter so that everybody is fully aware of the situation the city finds itself in: completely and to inspect and repair water valves. The conferees agree that there is a strong Federal interest in assuring that those who visit, live, and work in the Nation's Capital have safe drinking water. Accordingly, the conference agreement includes $1 million in Federal funds for this purpose under Amendment No. 2. These funds are provided to the Financial Control Board to contract with a private entity or entities to conduct an inspection, the flushing and repair work recommended by the EPA. The conferees direct the Control Board to consult with the Department of Public Works, D.C. Water and Sewer Authority, and EPA in implementing this activity. Further, the conferees encourage the Control Board to move expeditiously to contract for the work in anticipation of the funds provided. I just want to point out that if this bill passes, an immediate action will be taken to be able to correct the serious problems we have with the water in the city. So I hope that it would come to a point where we can pass that expeditiously today. The majority leader may or may not wish to call it up, but I want to let everyone know I am ready. It has passed the House. I want to assure all of the citizens of the District as well as those who visit us that we are doing everything possible and any delay would, again, impair the safety of certain individuals in the District, and I hope that does not occur. In addition, we are ready to move on this, and it is important for the city to get into a position where they know where they stand. There are significant differences that have been reconciled in favor of the city with respect to the amount of funds that will be available and to other matters. So I am hopeful that we will be able to take this bill up. It is ready to go. We are ready to act on it now and we could have this down to the President for his signature this afternoon if and when it is brought up there is no objection, and I hope that would be the case. Mr. President, I just hope that everybody is aware of the serious problem we are dealing with and that any attempt to forestall this would imperil people and I hope that will not occur.

The offset doesn't come from small States or from any part of the homeland security distributional money. Rather, it comes from two categories called information analysis and infrastructure protection, which is reduced by $187 million. We reduced it by adding up all the various specific amounts that were asked for in the specific programs, and this was an overage after that. Second, science and technology, research and development, where we went with the President's commitment of $803 million, rather than the committee number of $866 million. Our high-needs areas need help. This will do it without breaking the budget by one nickel. It does rearrange the priorities some, but it is the priorities we think are fair. We are trying to accommodate many colleagues on the other side who wished for an offset. This seems to be the right one. I reiterate, our high-needs areas, wherever they may be, or high-threat areas, need more help than they are given in the bill.

On the other hand, we were told a year ago it was the wrong time to vote. That was not an election year. Now we are told this year, it is the wrong time to vote. This is an election year. Now, since under our Constitution the House is elected every two years, if it is not right to vote in the year before the election and it is not right to vote in the year of the election, the correct answer from some of our friends on the left is that there is never a time to vote, because they do not want to expand markets. And I understand that. But we need to understand just how historic this moment is. And Members are going to have to live with their conscience for a long time if they vote ``no.'' We have entered the first deflation since the Great Depression, from Malaysia and Thailand, to Indonesia, to South Korea, to Japan, to Russia, now to Brazil, we see all over this planet people whose economies are shaky, whose currencies are shaky and they are looking for leadership. The choice for them is very simple: Do they move into the world market which since World War II has so dramatically increased the wealth of the entire world, including the United States? Or do they move towards autarchy and protectionism and beggaring their neighbors and all of the policies which under Smoot-Hawley led to the Great Depression? It is that simple. And you get to vote in a few minutes to send a signal to the entire world because the entire world is watching. My friend from Washington State said the Brazilians hope we defeat it. He is right. The Brazilians want us to defeat fast track because they are creating a common market in South America and they do not want American exports and they know that if we do not have fast track, corporations are going to build new plants in Brazil and new plants in Argentina and take the jobs out of the U.S. because they are going to go behind that barrier. The European Common Market wants you to vote ``no.'' The European Common Market knows that for the first time since World War II, they are selling more to Argentina and more to Brazil than the United States. So the European Common Market hopes you will vote ``no.'' That is the goal they have, make sure the American President stays impotent. You say we are playing politics? It is the American President, William Clinton, who sent up the request for fast track, and who this year talked about how bitterly, that is his word, bitterly he regretted the defeat of fast track last year in his own caucus. We did not bring it up last year because we were told it was impossible because your unions would not let you vote. Well, most of you do not have an opponent now. Most of you do not have an excuse now. This is a vote of conscience. You can vote ``no,'' and when you vote ``no,'' particularly those of you who have said for years you were free traders, you tell us who is playing politics: The people who vote their conscience, the people who vote for history, the people who send the signal to the world that we actually believe and vote for free trade? Or those of you who were for free trade until it became inconvenient for the Democratic Party? You were for free trade until the unions told you, not this time, not on this bill, not last year, not this year. And you think the unions are going to tell you next year, oh, that is fine, Gephardt and Gore can be for free trade in 1999, because after all, there will not be a presidential nomination, the unions will not care. Let us be honest. The fact is the Democratic Party is wedded to protectionism and it is willing to give away Latin America to the Europeans, it is willing to allow the Brazilians to create a common market that excludes America, it is willing to have the world market grow without us and if necessary it is willing to send the signal to Asia, go ahead and withdraw from the world market. And for what gain? Now, you will say, ``Well, it hurts America.'' Today's Washington Post, Poverty Rate Fell, Incomes Rose in 1997. This is the great damage of NAFTA. Poverty is going down, incomes are going up, we have the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years, the lowest inflation rate in 30 years, the lowest housing mortgage rate since 1967, because we have had the guts to compete in the world market, because our companies have grown leaner and tougher and smarter, because our farmers export, our small businesses export. 108,000 of the 113,000 exporters are small businesses. But that is not good enough. More jobs for Americans, more wealth. You think you are going to convince the Mexicans to establish a higher standard of child labor when you do not trade with them? You think you are going to convince El Salvador to create a higher standard of wealth when you do not trade with them? The fact is this administration could introduce a proposed child labor agreement with Mexico anytime it wants to. They could come up next week and introduce it as a freestanding bill and make it be heard on its merits. But that is an excuse. You know what the real issue is here. The real issue is, your union will not let you vote for free trade and you are willing to send a signal to the entire world at a time when a major firm was bailed out yesterday for $3.5 billion, an American firm, not a Japanese, not a Korean, not an Indonesian, an American firm, and in the middle of this level of instability, you yell partisan politics and then you vote partisan against your own rhetoric? I am not going to embarrass my colleagues by reading into the Record what they said, what their President has said, what the Vice President has said. Because when they go out of the country, they are for fast track. The fact is this year, the President said he is for fast track. This year the Vice President said he is for fast track. It is sad to see the partisan politics of the unions and the Democratic Party and yes, this may go down, but if this goes down and we end up in a steep worldwide recession, some of us will have had the comfort of knowing, we cast the right vote, we sent the right signal, and we tried to sustain what has worked for 50 years and not let the world slide back to what failed in the Great Depression.","word.count":1178,"sep11":-3.03932584269663,"years":1998.8202247191,"days":1360,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.219125078135559,"Topic 2":0.0106157100280448,"Topic 3":0.0185723679466356,"Topic 4":0.02497603478388,"Topic 5":0.00808649996116756,"Topic 6":0.429828080859325,"Topic 7":0.00276863243294319,"Topic 8":0.238396119563329,"Topic 9":0.0245610042130325,"Topic 10":0.0230704720760829},{"id":"10920060029450","body":"Melissa Hart: Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding This is a very important issue to discuss. I think it is one that many of us often look at very casually as we are naming a post office, but many times citizens of America whose names go on these post offices are people that we know we need to remember. And I bring one of those individuals before us today in our legislation to name the post office in Beaver, Pennsylvania, after Robert Linn. Robert Linn was one of those amazing people who anybody who ever met him would never forget. So I rise in support of the Robert Linn Memorial Post Office in Beaver, Pennsylvania. He was sworn into office as the mayor of Beaver, Pennsylvania, on January 2, 1946, and he served the Borough of Beaver, Pennsylvania, for 58 consecutive years as mayor. I am not exaggerating. It was really 58 years. So he was able to see many of the people he married as mayor welcome their grandchildren and great-grandchildren into the world. Prior to taking over the position of mayor at its original salary of $2,500 a year, Mayor Linn worked for the Duquesne Light Company. His first job was handling customer service before he eventually became supervisor of employee benefits, and he actually retired from the company in 1974. He continued his service both in the public and private sector throughout his life, and he was really known as a gracious gentleman. As I mentioned, anybody who knew him would never forget him. He showed up every day in a coat and tie. It didn't matter if it was Sundays, Saturdays, early, late. He was always in a coat and tie. In 1995, the Guinness Book of World Records recognized Robert Linn as the longest-serving mayor in American history. His selflessness, his regard for the greater good, is reflected in these 15 consecutive terms that he served up until his death at age of 95 on August 22, 2004. There is much more to Bob Linn than just being the longest-serving mayor in American history. It was Bob Linn, the father of four daughters, Mary Scheidmantel of Beaver; Eleanor Hesser of Beaver; Mary Hockenberry of New Cumberland, Pennsylvania; and Beth Mitchell of Virginia Beach, Virginia. There was Robert Linn, a grandfather of eight and a great-grandfather of one. He was definitely a dedicated family man, and he would do anything for his loved ones, including everyone in the Borough of Beaver. For example, when he was in his early 80s, he wanted to show his grandson that he, too, could ride a bicycle. Unfortunately, he learned the hard way that maybe he shouldn't be riding a bicycle. Although he was capable of running the town quite effectively as mayor in his advanced years, he was a little past his prime when it came to bike riding, when he fell off and broke his wrist, but he continued in his public service. There was Robert Linn, the mentor. A Beaver police chief was quoted as saying, ``One of the most important things that Mayor Linn ever told me was `You can think what you want, but once it is said, it is said.''' He said, ``I still to this day use this advice, and I pass it on to others. He was like a father to me,'' said Chief Anthony Hovanec. Bob Linn was a teacher for 6 years at the Beaver Falls Junior High School and a volunteer scorekeeper for the Beaver High School football games. He was just a man who loved his community. Finally, there was Robert Linn, the American and dedicated public servant, the one that I knew the best. He was a man dedicated to the community in which he lived to making sure it became better and better with every year he served in public life. Beaver Borough was Bob Linn's passion. His crowning achievement was the Streetscape project, which he proudly declared his finest accomplishment as mayor. This project received the Beaver Area Heritage Foundation's Harry S. Truman Beautification Award. The Streetscape transformed the Borough of Beaver into a real-life version of a Norman Rockwell painting. It removed all the utility poles, all the parking meters, and replaced them with trees and Victorian-style street lamps and bricked the sidewalks and streets. The Borough of Beaver and the 5,000 residents who live there still agree that Bob Linn's assessment that the borough was one of the ``best places you can be'' is certainly true. Mayor Linn was also successful in having the borough named a National Registry Historic District in 1996 and successfully converted the old freight train station in town into a museum. In fact, so many locals gathered there in October of 2000 that then-Governor George Bush, when he stopped his train on his cross-country tour, attracted so many residents of Beaver that they had to stop the train. The Borough of Beaver and the 5,000 residents who live there still agree that Bob Linn was the most effective community leader they have ever seen. And I think beyond just the Borough of Beaver, people in the Commonwealth and people across the Nation need to see as an example of public service what Bob Linn did. His effect on the borough goes much farther than aesthetics. He was a father, mentor, teacher, volunteer, and really the embodiment of a public servant. He truly loved Beaver to its core. He tirelessly dedicated himself and his life to making it the best place that it can be. I urge my colleagues to support the Robert Linn Memorial Post Office to honor a man who so generously dedicated his life to the town that he loved so future generations can know all about Bob Linn.","word.count":963,"sep11":5.15449438202247,"years":2007.01404494382,"days":4277,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.746514949327888,"Topic 2":0.0844070894213396,"Topic 3":0.0183637780457605,"Topic 4":0.0390154274246368,"Topic 5":0.0187238754093806,"Topic 6":0.0175150798849644,"Topic 7":0.0146157205104219,"Topic 8":0.0319025652509988,"Topic 9":0.0203689196321107,"Topic 10":0.00857259509249873},{"id":"10419950108593","body":"Joe Biden: May I add a followup question?

DeLauro: Madam Speaker, I rise today to announce and celebrate the introduction of the Women's Health Equity Act of 1996. Included in the omnibus legislation are two bills that I have authored, the HPV Infection and Cervical Cancer Research Resolution, which I will introduce today, and the Equitable Health Care for Neurobiological Disorders Act of 1996. Both measures will enhance the length and quality of life for women in this country, and should be enacted by this Congress. First, I am proud to introduce the HPV Infection and Cervical Cancer Research Resolution. This vital legislation will speed the detection and diagnosis of cervical cancer, and will, in fact, help to save women's lives. Early detection is the most effective method of stopping this killer of women. I know. I am a survivor of ovarian cancer, and early detection saved my life. My measure expresses the sense of Congress that the National Cancer Institute and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases should conduct collaborative basic and clinical research on the human papilloma virus [HPV] diagnosis and prevention as an indicator for cervical cancer. Approximately 16,000 new cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed each year, and about 4,800 women die from this disease annually. However, if cervical cancer is detected while in its earliest in situ state, the likelihood of survival is almost 100 percent. HPV is a known risk factor for cervical cancer. Of the more than 70 types of HPV that have been identified, two types, types 16 and 18 in particular, have a strong linkage to cervical cancer. With further study of the natural history of HPV and its association to the development of cervical cancer, HPV testing may prove to be an effective tool to aid the early diagnosis of this deadly disease. Therefore, it is appropriate to recommend basic and clinical research to determine how to utilize this data in the screening of women in clinics and hospitals across the country. My legislation will bridge the gap between new scientific discoveries about the linkage of HPV with cervical cancer and practical application of that knowledge by physicians and qualified health specialists in local communities. The legislation has received the endorsement of the American Social Health Association. In addition, I am proud to include my bill in the Women's Health Equity Act of 1996. In addition, I have introduced H.R. 1797, the Equitable Health Care for Neurobiological Disorders Act, into the Women's Health Equity Act of 1996. This legislation requires nondiscriminatory treatment of neurobiological disorders in employer health benefit plans. Under my bill, insurance coverage must be provided in a manner that is consistent with coverage for other major illnesses. Neurobiological disorders, include affective disorders like major depression, anxiety disorders, autism, schizophrenia, and Tourette's syndrome. Currently, in short, individuals with neurobiological disorders receive much less insurance coverage than illnesses such as cancer, heart disease, or diabetes. This in equality contributes to the myth that such disorders are not physical illnesses and somehow they are the fault of the patient. For the individuals and the families affected by these disorders, the ordeal of coping with the disease is often compounded by severe financial burdens. My legislation recognizes the physical basis for many mental disorders, and requires their equal health coverage. Just as the Kennedy-Kassebaum-Roukema health insurance reform bill addresses the need to ensure access to health care for Americans who change jobs, my bill ensures access to health care for Americans who suffer from mental disorders. Both job portability and comprehensive coverage are key access issues in the health reform discussion. Without comprehensive coverage or health insurance portability, millions of Americans will be forced to seek treatment in expensive health care settings, like emergency rooms, or drain other social service institutions. Mental disorders severely impact the health and the quality of life for millions of women throughout the Nation. Clearly, the equitable insurance coverage for mental disorders is an issue for all of us in society, as it is a women's health concern, as well. Treatments for mental illnesses like depression exist and have a very high rate of success; therefore, it is essential that women suffering from neurobiological disorders have access to the care that they need. Madam Speaker, I am proud to announce the introduction of these two bills. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor and enact the omnibus bill.","word.count":724,"sep11":-5.60112359550562,"years":1996.25842696629,"days":448,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.137000522810918,"Topic 2":0.105518041226292,"Topic 3":0.0101051031686651,"Topic 4":0.138083085175353,"Topic 5":0.00686720798034253,"Topic 6":0.00640742946848473,"Topic 7":0.0293812919376114,"Topic 8":0.0158276340683277,"Topic 9":0.544250698772519,"Topic 10":0.0065589853914868},{"id":"10920060013755","body":"Todd Tiahrt: Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word Mr. Chairman, I intended to offer and withdraw an amendment tonight in order to make the point that over the last generation, Congress has created barriers to keeping and creating jobs in America.

Shortly, on August 4, a young man that I am very familiar with, Jake Smith, who just graduated from Syracuse University's School of Architecture, fulfilled his dream and got a degree and will be getting married. He is marrying a young lady, Kristin Elmer, who is a teacher. The two of them have fallen in love, are getting married. One of the things they did not want to factor in was the possibility that their tax obligation would increase simply because they are getting married. This is designed to correct and eliminate that inequity. That story is replicated thousands of times over, not just in my home county of Oneida, but in my 23rd Congressional District of New York where there are 55,000 people who are in similar situations. Then one multiplies that by 435 and go across the country, and one can see this really has a significant impact. We are talking about providing meaningful tax relief to 25 million Americans. More than that, it expands those who are eligible for the lowest rate of taxation, the 15 percent bracket. I think that is very important. So I am, for all the right reasons, very enthusiastic in my support of this bill. It does the right thing for the right reasons. In America we should be encouraging those who decide to take the vows and not providing disincentives for getting married. So as I extend greetings to young Mr. Smith and young Miss Elmer upon their impending wedding, I will be able to do so and to tell them in very meaningful terms that we are cognizant of their needs and we are trying to address them. With that, Mr. Speaker, I thank once again the gentlewoman from Ohio for yielding me this time, and I thank my distinguished colleague, the gentleman from Massachusetts , a Boston Red Sox fan, for his indulgence to this New York Yankee fan.

Senior citizens, students, children, and working families will suffer so that the privileged can profit. Republicans are engaged in an unseemly scheme to hide what they are doing from the American people. Their proposals are too harsh and too extreme. They cannot stand the light of day--and they know it. The fundamental injustice of the Republican plan is plain. Mr. President, $270 billion in Medicare cuts that hurt senior citizens are being used to pay for $245 billion in tax cuts that help the wealthiest individuals and corporations in America. The Republican bills are also loaded with sweetheart deals for special interests, whose money and clout are being used behind closed doors to subvert the public interest and obtain special favors. The sections of the legislation dealing with health care are packed with payola for the powerful. The dishonor roll of those who will benefit from the giveaways in this Republican plan reads like a ``Who's Who'' of special interests in the health care industry. The pharmaceutical industry--the most profitable industry in America--benefits lavishly from the Republican program. The House bill repeals the requirement that the pharmaceutical industry must give discounts to Medicaid nursing home patients and to public hospitals and other institutions serving the poor. The total cost to the taxpayers from these giveaways is $1.2 billion a year--close to $10 billion over the life of the legislation. The Democrats in the Finance Committee forced the elimination of this giveaway in the Senate bill, and the amendment, which I intend to offer as instructions to the conference, is designed to ensure that it is not included in the conference report. The American Medical Association also receives lavish benefits in the Republican bill in return for its support of these excessive cuts in Medicare. The weakening of the physicians anti-fraud and physicians conflict-of-interest rules in the Republican program has been estimated by the Congressional Budget Office to cost taxpayers $1.5 billion over the next 7 years. Even more harmful to the Medicare patients is the elimination of restrictions on billing, so that doctors will be able to charge more than Medicare will pay, and collect the difference from senior citizens. Under current law, such billing is prohibited for Medicare patients enrolling in private HMOs or competitive medical plans--the only private plans currently allowed to contract to provide Medicare benefits. The Republican Senate bill eliminates this prohibition for HMOs, and for every private plan. When the plan is fully implemented, senior citizens could pay as much as $5 billion more for medical care a year as a result of the elimination of these protections. We had this as an amendment during the time of reconciliation. We received some assurance that the billing provisions had been addressed, the double-billing provisions would be addressed, then under review of the language of the reconciliation we find that no place in those over- 1,000 pages could you find the kinds of protections that exist there under the Social Security Act. Our amendment directs the conferees to restore the limits on such billing and maintain strong protections against fraud and abuse. Another extreme provision of the House bill is its elimination of all the Federal nursing home standards, a payoff to unscrupulous nursing home operators who seek to profit from the misery of senior citizens and the disabled. The Senate amendment adopted last Friday pretends to restore nursing home standards to the Senate bill but, in fact, it leaves a loophole wide enough to permit continued abuse of tens of thousands of patients. It allows State waivers that could weaken Federal standards and avoid Federal oversight and enforcement. Weakening current Federal standards is a giveaway to unscrupulous nursing home operators. This amendment instructs the conferees to maintain the current strict standards. One of the cruel aspects of the Republican proposal is its failure to protect nursing home patients and their relatives from financial abuse.","word.count":675,"sep11":-6.01123595505618,"years":1995.84831460674,"days":302,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.866411329280597,"Topic 2":0.0461731341632768,"Topic 3":0.00916278560721278,"Topic 4":0.0216494668698863,"Topic 5":0.00955607349592349,"Topic 6":0.00951044011418037,"Topic 7":0.00756307150584545,"Topic 8":0.0159870387844517,"Topic 9":0.00991784972722046,"Topic 10":0.00406881045140511},{"id":"10820040002941","body":"Peter Hoekstra: Mr. Speaker, today I want to spend a little bit of time talking about the war on terrorism, and I believe it is a war, tracing the history of the previous administrations and the Bush administration in recognizing the threat that al Qaeda, Iraq, and others pose to the United States as evidenced most dramatically on the events of September 11, 2001. Back in February 1998, then-President Clinton talked about the threat of Iraq: ``They have harassed the inspectors, lied to them, disabled monitoring cameras, literally spirited evidence out of the back doors.'' Another quote: ``They,'' predators of the 21st century, ``will be all the more lethal if we allow them to build arsenals of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, and the missiles to deliver them. We simply cannot allow that to happen. There should be no doubt, Saddam's ability to produce and deliver weapons of mass destruction poses a grave threat to the peace of that region and the security of the world. There is no more clear example of this threat than Saddam Hussein's Iraq. His regime threatens the safety of the people, the stability of his region, and the security of all the rest of us. In the next century, the community of nations may see more and more of the very kind of threat Iraq poses, a rogue state with weapons of mass destruction, ready to use them, to provide them to terrorists who travel the world. If we fail to respond today, Saddam Hussein will be emboldened tomorrow by the knowledge that they can act with impunity.'' Another quote from President Clinton in 1998: ``I have no doubt he would use them again if permitted to develop them.'' So back in 1998, President Clinton was highlighting the threat as he saw it, in this case talking about Iraq specifically, but also laying out the possibility of what might happen in the future. Again the quote: ``A rogue state with weapons of mass destruction, ready to use them or provide them to terrorists.'' On September 11, 2001, we found out in the United States about the willingness of terrorist organizations to use airplanes as a weapon of mass destruction and to inflict death and destruction to an extent we had never seen before. Another quote, and this is from President Clinton, I believe: ``Some day, some way, I guarantee you he will use the arsenal; and I think everyone of you who has worked on this for any length of time believes that, too.'' Again, not President Bush in 2001, 2002 or 2003, but a consistent message beginning in the late 1990s from President Clinton and his administration outlining the threat of Iraq; and, more importantly, the threat of a linkage of the capabilities that Iraq might have and their willingness to give those capabilities and share them with terrorist organizations. Again, the same speech: ``Saddam Hussein's Iraq reminds us of what we learned in the 20th century and warns us what we must know about the 21st century. In this century, we learned through harsh experience that the only answer to aggression and illegal behavior is firmness, determination and, when necessary, action. In the next century, the community of nations may see more and more the very kind of threat Iraq poses now, a rogue state with weapons of mass destruction ready to use them or provide them to terrorists, drug traffickers or organized criminals who travel the world among us unnoticed.'' Through the window of 9/11, we can see how prophetic President Clinton was in 1998. Let me read that again: ``In this century, we learned through harsh experience that the only answer to aggression and illegal behavior is firmness, determination and, when necessary, action. In the next century, the community of nations may see more and more the very kind of threat Iraq poses now,'' or paraphrasing, that I believe terrorist organizations will pose in the 21st century. December 17, 1998, President Clinton said: ``I am convinced that the decision I made to order this military action, though difficult, was absolutely the right thing to do. It is in our interest and in the interest of the people around the world. Saddam Hussein has used weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles before. I have no doubt he would use them again if permitted to develop them.'' So back in the 1990s, the late 1990s, President Clinton was highlighting the threat of Iraq and also outlining the threats of terrorist organizations in the 21st century. Another quote, and this is from the White House, a White House briefing. It is a speech by Senator Al Gore. This is way back in 1992. So even in the early 1990s, key officials in what would become the Clinton administration had identified the challenges that we would face as a Nation in the 21st century. Here is what Senator Al Gore said: ``He had already launched poison gas attacks repeatedly,'' and this is what he says about the President at that time, ``and Bush looked the other way. He had already conducted extensive terrorist activities, and Bush looked the other way. He was already deeply involved in the effort to acquire nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, and Bush knew it, but he looked the other way.'' Then Senator Al Gore in 1992 said: ``Well, in my view, the Bush administration was acting in a manner directly opposite to what you would expect. With all of the evidence that it had available to it at the time, Saddam Hussein's nature and intentions were perfectly visible.'' In other remarks made by Vice President Al Gore, May 23, 2000, talking about the threat of Saddam Hussein: ``Despite our swift victory in every sense, there is no doubt in my mind that Saddam Hussein still seeks to amass weapons of mass destruction. You know as well as I do that as long as Saddam Hussein stays in power, there can be no comprehensive peace for the people of Israel or the people of the Middle East. We have made it clear,'' and this is Vice President Al Gore on May 23, 2000, ``we have made it clear that it is our policy to see Saddam Hussein gone.'' In parentheses, applause. ``We have sought coalitions of opponents to challenge his power. I have met with the Iraqi opposition, and invite them to meet with me again next month when I will encourage them to further unite in their efforts against Saddam.'' The threat to peace in the civilized world was well identified through the Clinton administration through the 1990s. Here is another article talking about folks and their views of Saddam Hussein dated November 1997: ``The stakes are very real, and they are enormous,'' said Richard Haass, Middle East expert on the National Security Council during the Bush administration. ``This is someone who has used weapons of mass destruction twice against his own people and against Iran. He does not have qualms. Based on U.N. inspection reports and Western intelligence assessments, Washington's allies are convinced that Saddam Hussein possesses the resources and technical skill to begin cranking out menacing new supplies of exotic weaponry and delivery systems with even a brief absence of foreign watch dogs.'' That is the same thing that David Kay said when he came back, saying at this point in time the Iraqi survey group may not have found stockpiled weapons of mass destruction, and David Kay believes that maybe they did not exist after meeting with the new folks over there. He said we may or may not find the stockpiles, but the key thing here, and this is what David Kay said, which was reported already in 1997: ``Washington and its allies are convinced that Hussein possesses the resources and technical skill to begin cranking out menacing new supplies of exotic weaponry and delivery systems with even a brief absence of foreign watch dogs.'' So the real question was after the war and after we went in and took a look at what they had, what did David Kay find? He found exactly what was identified in 1997, that if the stockpiles are not there, what Saddam Hussein has done is he has developed the capability, the weaponry, to crank out menacing new supplies during a brief absence of foreign watch dogs. The intent was clear. Saddam Hussein used weapons of mass destruction at one time, may have had stockpiles, but clearly was building the technical infrastructure to be able to produce significant quantities of weapons of mass destruction in a relatively short period of time once the inspectors were gone and once sanctions were lifted. September 9, 1998, Madeleine Albright: ``In this struggle our adversaries are likely to avoid traditional battlefield situations because there American dominance is well established. We must be concerned instead by weapons of mass destruction and by the cowardly instruments of sabotage and hidden bombs. These unconventional threats endanger not only our Armed Forces but all Americans and America's friends everywhere. We must understand that this confrontation is long-term. It doesn't lend itself to a quick victory.'' For those of us who believe that September 11 was the culmination of our war with al Qaeda and with terrorist organizations, listen to Madeleine Albright, 1998, who recognized that this war was already going on in the 1990s because of the length and the number of attacks that had taken place during the 1990s. Remember, early in the 1990s was the first time that the World Trade Center was hit, and she recognized in her quote: ``We must understand that this confrontation is long- term. It doesn't lend itself to quick victory.'' She goes on to say: ``Force for peace, freedom, progress and law in the world. But no threat, no bomb, no terrorist can diminish America's determination to lead.'' She then also goes on: ``A second major threat to America's security also has entered a new phase and that is weapons of mass destruction and the systems that deliver them. For decades, we viewed this threat primarily through a narrow Cold War lens and now our concerns have broadened. We are deeply concerned by regional tensions in South Asia where both India and Pakistan","word.count":7486,"sep11":2.54213483146067,"years":2004.40168539326,"days":3347,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.11736674303586,"Topic 2":0.0822319503348359,"Topic 3":0.0283945820621745,"Topic 4":0.0168716604142312,"Topic 5":0.0105139763400162,"Topic 6":0.0087065084093868,"Topic 7":0.163078939289891,"Topic 8":0.117738041130157,"Topic 9":0.391639579643082,"Topic 10":0.0634580193403661},{"id":"11020070056326","body":"Sheila Jackson-Lee: Without objection, it is so ordered","word.count":216,"sep11":6.39606741573034,"years":2008.25561797753,"days":4719,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.235904914880666,"Topic 2":0.0594946163957007,"Topic 3":0.0210646220509913,"Topic 4":0.0138099055369343,"Topic 5":0.0506733922909563,"Topic 6":0.00791774637870603,"Topic 7":0.0092916733433639,"Topic 8":0.0290153889196681,"Topic 9":0.551739459073906,"Topic 10":0.0210882811291077},{"id":"10519980077426","body":"Robert Bennett: I simply have to respond to the notion that this is an amendment to fire the incumbent general counsel.

The National Guard has performed magnificently, heroically, and with great professional skill, as well as patriotism. When I wore the uniform of this country as a member of the U.S. Army Active-Duty back in the late 1960s, the National Guard was a much different creature. Today, as the Presiding Officer so well knows, the National Guard is, in many cases, as skilled as, if not even more skilled in particular skills, the regular Army. Thus, when we encounter a threat to the interests of the United States and have to respond abroad, as we have both in Afghanistan and Iraq--especially in Iraq but before that in the Balkans--the National Guard is called on to supply so many of those troops. My wife and I make it a point on holidays such as Thanksgiving to have Thanksgiving dinner with troops in different parts of the world. One time we found ourselves with our troops in Bosnia. At that particular point in one of those camps out in the fields where we had that Thanksgiving dinner, of that entire U.S. military force, which was our ninth year in Bosnia helping stabilize that place from the fratricide and killing that occurred there before, lo and behold, who were those troops? Those troops were the National Guard. In that particular case, it was the National Guard unit from Pennsylvania. They knew they had a 6-month tour of duty and then they would go home-- remember, the National Guard members have their civilian jobs, and what they signed up for also encompasses if there is an emergency in their State, they are under the control of their Governor. Now we find that we have entered a new era in which we are stretched to the limit on our regular Army troops and almost as if it is an expected thing of replacing regular Army with National Guard. Of course, something is going to have to change, and I think the head of the National Guard and the head of the Reserves are addressing this because they are quite concerned that over time, they are going to see people not reenlisting in the Reserves and the Guard, and in order to compensate for that and encourage that, I think we are going to see our military leadership is going to be setting forth an agenda where Guard and Reserves would have a more certain anticipation that within a period of years, say, 4 years, they would serve a number of months of active duty. I hope that is going to solve some of the problems; otherwise, people might be voting with their feet as they leave the National Guard. The thrust of my remarks is to tell about when the National Guard is activated, as it has been very heroically from my State--the Florida National Guard was, in fact, in Iraq before the war started. We went in there with special operations troops, and they have performed magnificently. Initially, they thought they were going for 6 months. Then they understood 12 months. But in some cases, they were extended to 14 and 15 months. So in those long deployments, what happens back home? The families are anxious naturally. The families are usually without the primary breadwinner in the family. The families--the remaining spouses and the children--are often facing a new kind of not only emotional problems but financial problems, not even to speak of the question of the financial situation facing the employer back home. What should we do? Talk to any National Guard commander and he will tell you that a most important support for those families is the Family Assistance Centers. We have them all over the country. They did not used to get nearly the attention they do today because when fully implemented, when fully funded, when giving the attention to the families back home while their loved ones are abroad, they are giving them counseling, they are helping them get proper counseling on financial management, and they are serving as a center point for networking among the other National Guard families while their loved ones are deployed overseas. Thus, last year, when we had this very same bill on the Senate floor, the Department of Defense authorization, I offered an amendment, and it was accepted, providing $10 million for these Family Assistance Centers. This is $10 million out of a $400 billion-plus DOD authorization bill. It was accepted. A lot of that $10 million has not been allocated in the last year. Lo and behold, we are seeing some resistance to doing the same thing. I wanted to give notice to the Senate that coming up will be my amendment authorizing $10 million for Family Assistance Centers for our National Guard families at home. It is one of the least things we can do because it has been so effective. It has been so effective over the course of the past year. But right now, they are anticipating that they are not going to have those resources because they are not in the National Guard budget. I want to make sure it is going to be in the National Guard budget. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.","word.count":400,"sep11":1.55898876404494,"years":2003.41853932584,"days":2997,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.242576170981862,"Topic 2":0.290856716042399,"Topic 3":0.200289252278097,"Topic 4":0.0864016925411057,"Topic 5":0.0139504589659252,"Topic 6":0.00572253219292065,"Topic 7":0.00402100263832485,"Topic 8":0.0467072927188245,"Topic 9":0.0638111938893631,"Topic 10":0.0456636877511783},{"id":"10820030045510","body":"Robert Bennett: Mr. President, I, first, would like to comment on the way my day began. It happened to begin with the distinguished Presiding officer, the Senator from Minnesota, early this morning, as we engaged in a project that many people around the country have participated in. For those who have not, I hope they do participate in it; and that is, to build--I was not going to say a house--but, indeed, a home as part of Habitat for Humanity. Not too far from here--about 15 minutes from our Nation's Capitol-- there is a plot of land. We have been blessed in many ways because, right now, we have been part of a group of people who put up several houses. We did not put them all up today, but eventually that whole site--and it is probably a couple-acre site; actually, it must be larger than that--will have 50 different houses with individual homeowners, families who will call those houses their homes. Many of those people have no homes today, but they have devoted a fair amount of planning, with their sweat and their equity and their spirit, in helping to construct these houses through Habitat for Humanity. We were there with a number of House Members and Senate Members. It was bipartisan, bicameral. It was part of what is called ``Congress Building America.'' Today was called: ``Congress Building America National Build.'' It was a great celebration this morning. Millard Fuller was there. Millard Fuller is the man who had the vision and the heart to first think of and then lay out and then implement Habitat for Humanity International. His commitment reflects a merging, a coming together of faith, a call to service. He has professional training. He has been a very successful attorney. We had an opportunity to congratulate him, but also to spend most of the morning working side by side with him. Millard is a fascinating individual. He travels around the world both promoting and educating people about Habitat for Humanity. I talked to him a bit this morning about recent trips I have had the opportunity to make, again, one with the Presiding Officer to Africa, where, to me, we have a great opportunity, but also there is great hope, as we look at that continent today. This morning there were teams of five or six people who worked together, with a leader in that team. I was not the leader for those 3 to 4 hours. We had a young woman by the name of Dawn, who is part of the AmeriCorps affiliation with Habitat for Humanity, who walked us through the construction of this house that was nothing but a slab of concrete, but by the time we left, it had the walls up around it. But part of my team was also Charlissa Tomlinson. Charlissa is the owner of the home, who began, about 2 years ago, with this dream, and now, with her three children there today, participated in the construction of that very house. As we put up that last wall, and there was a window there, and we looked out the window, I asked: Whose bedroom is this going to be? She very quickly told me which child's bedroom it was going to be. She has been very active in her church, very active in her community. The realization of her family's dream shows us how powerful volunteers can be, how the very best of the public sector, Government, which funds, in part, Habitat for Humanity, and the 10 or 15 sponsors, organizations, companies that invest, and invest heavily, in support of Habitat for Humanity can come together. I thank my colleagues because this is the first year we have had broad bipartisan, bicameral participation. A number of Senators have gone out and participated before, but today we broke all records in terms of Senate participation in this wonderful, wonderful project. We were there to demonstrate our commitment, as elected leaders. I should also add that the spouses of the Senators were there as well throughout the morning. They even stayed into the afternoon. But we really were there to demonstrate our commitment, our deep, personal commitment to affordable home ownership for low-income American families. We were also there to show our appreciation for faith-based groups and other nonprofits such as Habitat for Humanity that do provide these critical services to individuals and families in need across America. Home ownership is such an essential part of our lives, of our social investments, of our economic investments. It is empowering to families. It is empowering to communities. It contributes economic vitality to areas and regions in communities where these beautiful new homes arise. So it was an exciting project this morning. We have done a lot. As we were there and looking around, we saw the AmeriCorps volunteers. There was a group of college students from Cornell who, instead of going where 99.9 percent of the college students go--to vacation, which I guess is Florida or the west coast or to warmer weather--dedicated their spring vacation to being there and hammering nails, and spending their 8 days away from Cornell--again, colleges all over the country are doing this, but they were with us today, and the volunteers from the community, working with the corporate executives, working with the Members of the Senate. It was really, really gratifying. The Congress participates and works with the administration. We provided $27 million this year for the Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program, SHOP. Under this grant program, homeowners contribute significant amounts of their own volunteer labor to the construction or to the rehabilitation of a property. President Bush requested $67 million next year for this particular program, SHOP, Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program. The 108th Congress passed and President Bush signed the American Dream Downpayment Act of 2003. That is going to help over 40,000 families a year with their downpayment and closing costs and further strengthen our housing market all over the country. Seeing the Senate in action, as we hammered and nailed and put the siding up, made me realize how much this body does do and cares in terms of eliminating poverty housing in America. I hope that demonstrates our commitment to that goal and our continued commitment for affordable housing throughout America but in particular for low-income American families.","word.count":1495,"sep11":1.41573033707865,"years":2003.27528089888,"days":2946,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.450118726369877,"Topic 2":0.184083205217714,"Topic 3":0.0180998056555885,"Topic 4":0.0173287741162052,"Topic 5":0.0564313358784851,"Topic 6":0.164448214519447,"Topic 7":0.010025778870993,"Topic 8":0.0750560549205442,"Topic 9":0.012159601306895,"Topic 10":0.0122485031442514},{"id":"10619990011325","body":"David Dreier: Mr. Chairman, we have before us today a landmark bill-- one that defines bipartisanship in the most extreme form. If you can imagine George Miller and Don Young reaching agreement on a measure to spend billions in federal funding to protect the environment. Now, that is a landmark. I commend my colleagues, Mr. Miller and Mr. Young, for their ingenuity, tenacity and civility in bringing this legislation to the floor. H.R. 701 represents a major first step in bringing funding in line with our federal priorities to protect natural resources and open spaces across the country. This bill is supported by 75 percent of the House membership. The investment H.R. 701 makes in our natural resources will have a lasting effect. From acquiring lands for areas of national significance to developing programs for inner-city youth, its impact will resonate throughout future generations who will enjoy new sources of recreation. H.R. 701 brings certainty to the protection of our natural resources by putting in place permanent funding for land acquisition for conservation purposes by setting aside OCS oil royalties in the Conservation and Reinvestment Act Fund. Adequate funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund is long overdue. After years of patiently waiting for OCS revenues to be used for their intended purpose--land acquisition--Mr. Miller and Mr. Young have resorted to this unique alliance to deliver what has long been promised. Under the CARA Fund, $2.8 billion each year would be allotted for programs receiving mandatory funding to include the following: $1 billion for coastal conservation; $900 million for the Land and Water Conservation Fund; $350 million for wildlife conservation; $125 million for urban parks and recreation; $100 million for historic preservation; $200 million for federal and Indian land restoration; $100 million for farmland protection and $50 million for endangered species recovery. Again, I commend Mr. Miller and Mr. Young for their work on this bill and for their efforts to protect our nation's natural resources.

So, in effect, the mandate to allow Mexican trucks that meet high safety standards is the law of the land. The question is whether we are going to comply with it in a way that protects the safety of the driving public in America. My amendment makes clear that we should maintain and mandate high standards, and my amendment does that. I would never tolerate an unsafe truck on our American highways, particularly on Texas highways. I don't care whether it comes from Mexico or Canada or from the United States, we should not tolerate unsafe trucks. What my amendment does is it makes sure that those high safety standards are enforced and maintained. I have to ask: How does it look if we are going to hold trucks coming from Mexico to a different standard than we are with trucks coming from Canada? The suggestion is that because trucks are coming from Mexico, they are somehow incapable of meeting these high safety standards. I can tell my colleagues, as somebody who comes from a border State with 1,600 miles of common border with Mexico, there are challenges along the border, but legal trade and legal commerce are important to the people in Texas, and they are important to the people of the United States. For every truck entering into the United States from Mexico that has to be tested, if it fails to pass a test, it will be put out of service; for every truck that is going to come into the United States under NAFTA, a truck will be able to travel from the United States into Mexico. So this is a matter of enforcing free trade requirements that are part of the law of the land that have been litigated all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court and about which there isn't any controversy. The only question that remains is whether we are going to treat trucks from Canada and trucks from Mexico the same. I submit we should, and we should hold both to the high standards of public safety which my amendment will require. And as I said earlier, if in fact trucks participating in this program must be inspected every 3 months, the same standard as U.S. trucks, every driver entering the country under this program would have to verify compliance with safety requirements and they would have to do so every time they enter the United States. If in fact the Department of Transportation's inspector general fails to certify that the program actually makes sure every truck is inspected and every driver is verified--if the inspector general fails to certify to such--then funding for this program would be automatically suspended. So under my approach, for the first time, we will enshrine the principle that we inspect and certify every single truck, whether it comes from Mexico or whether it comes from Canada, that would enter the United States under this program. I know that previously a letter from the Secretary of Transportation has been made part of the Congressional Record here which addresses some of the concerns raised by the Senator from North Dakota with regard to border license checks of drivers working for Mexican carriers. The Department of Transportation has noted that there is a required check of the commercial driver's license of each driver of a Mexican domiciled carrier crossing the border. So I believe the concerns raised by the distinguished Senator from North Dakota have been addressed by the Department of Transportation, and given the stringent inspection requirements and public safety requirements of my amendment, I believe that is what my colleagues should support, one that is compliant with what in essence is the law of the land and which will protect the safety of the public. Mr. President, I yield the floor.","word.count":681,"sep11":6.15449438202247,"years":2008.01404494382,"days":4633,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0348276529341906,"Topic 2":0.056636446074423,"Topic 3":0.0127710916596222,"Topic 4":0.101908888993979,"Topic 5":0.00952217024974643,"Topic 6":0.0214506189782732,"Topic 7":0.135202061622897,"Topic 8":0.525213451191758,"Topic 9":0.0808553199969275,"Topic 10":0.0216122982981839},{"id":"11020080014748","body":"David R. Obey: Madam Speaker, ahead of time, I will not yield to anyone until I have completed my statement. This criticism on process comes from the same crowd that stood by and allowed 30 pages of unread material to be surreptitiously and anonymously slipped into a conference report on the defense bill after the conference report had completed action, language which insulated the drug industry from liability in cases where their products injured the health of customers. This comes from the same crowd that several years ago blocked the ability of this House to vote on a single matter that had anything at all to do with the most significant domestic appropriation bill, the Labor-Health-Education bill. They simply wrapped it into other items and refused to allow the House to work its will on any piece of that proposal which had more than 500 programs which were insulated from House review. This comes from the same crowd that brought three supplemental appropriation bills to the floor without running those bills through the Appropriations Committee or subcommittee. Now they say that they want one vote on the package all put together. Well, let me tell you, what we are trying to do is to avoid Members having to look at everything in one package. What we are trying to do is to give them a straight up-or-down vote, a clean shot on the issue of whether you want to provide funding for the war or not. It is a procedurally neutral approach. If you want funding for the war, you vote ``yes'' and if you don't want it, you vote ``no.'' That way you can't hide on that issue. It stands out there alone, and people see where you stand. We are also having a separate vote on whether or not we should impose conditions on the administration in exchange for the use of that money, straight up-or-down vote, clean shot at it, can't hide behind any other issue. And thirdly, we are taking the administration's other requests and two priorities of our own and putting them together in a third amendment, again separate, not tied into a big package, out there so that Members can choose up or down whether they want to do that or not. I make no apology for that. Now we are being lectured about the fact that this is a bloated bill. Out of all of the appropriated items in this bill, all but $2 billion are requested by the administration. Congress has the temerity to be asking to spend 1 percent of the appropriated amount in this bill. The rest the President takes ownership of. Secondly, we are being told, Oh, it's terrible because we've taken a military bill and ``larded'' it up was the term that the gentleman from Janesville used, that we larded it up with unemployment compensation and with the expanded GI Bill. Well, I suppose additional unemployment compensation benefits may look like lard to a Member who makes $165,000 a year; but to people who have exhausted their unemployment benefits and have been out of work for 6 months, it doesn't look like lard to them; it looks like basic bread, and I think we should be ashamed of the fact that we haven't provided this sooner. It also may look like lard to the gentleman from Janesville for us to say that we want to provide expanded education benefits to the GIs who fought this war. But I would remind every Member of this House, this is the first war in my knowledge where we have never had any sense of shared sacrifice. The only people in this society who are being asked to sacrifice are the veterans and the military families. They have been sent to Iraq and Afghanistan again and again and again, and we have the quaint idea that we ought to be able to take 6 percent of the cost of that war to date, 6 percent, and devote it to expanding education benefits for people who have sacrificed by wearing the uniform of the United States.","word.count":680,"sep11":6.84831460674157,"years":2008.70786516854,"days":4880,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.032549717950514,"Topic 2":0.0306003518988287,"Topic 3":0.00790490616352362,"Topic 4":0.0283462652586609,"Topic 5":0.00619840349629913,"Topic 6":0.4904162786131,"Topic 7":0.00620484921328049,"Topic 8":0.360757795457071,"Topic 9":0.0337485895625467,"Topic 10":0.0032728423861752},{"id":"10620000003941","body":"Earl Pomeroy: Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for allowing us to express our thoughts on this important matter. I would begin my thoughts by joining the Speaker's expression of regret about the resignation of Dr. Ford, who has served this institution so well and been a dear friend and an important chaplain to each of us. I thought that at some point, I might, as cochair of the chaplain selection process, have the opportunity to address the body as to the version, our version in the minority, of the events that have transpired throughout this chaplain selection process. I did not anticipate it coming today, in the middle of the budget vote; and I did not anticipate following the Speaker of the House, a person for whom I have considerable regard relative to his obviously heartfelt remarks just delivered. My remarks are not prepared. I ask you to bear with me. I want to convey a deep sense of sorrow and regret that a process that began so honorably by the Speaker has ended in this fashion. Clearly, Speaker Hastert wanted to capture the bipartisan efforts of other Speakers as the chaplain was selected but improve upon it. So when Speaker O'Neill asked the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations and the ranking member of the Committee on Appropriations to go and agree on a chaplain that he might then appoint, that was bipartisanship. It could have been improved upon and Speaker Hastert set upon a process that did improve upon it. It had even broader involvement, eight minority, eight majority. We were even given a cochair opportunity. We were very, very pleased and heartened by this gesture by the Speaker, because we believe that the chaplain is the chaplain of the House, not the Speaker's chaplain, not the majority chaplain, but the chaplain for all of us. We advanced with the work, and it was considerable. Thirty-eight resumes to pore through. We culled it down in a process that had more comity and agreement across the party aisle to 17 interviews. Going through the hours of interviews, we developed friendships across party aisles, members of the committee. I so enjoyed working with my cochair, the gentleman from Virginia , and each of the members, majority and minority alike. We then got it down to six semifinalists working toward the list of three. And while the Speaker is absolutely correct, his letter to us says send up to three names, the discussion throughout was to send three names. And we did not seriously consider sending less than three names. As the final balloting occurred, even though this had been a process utterly without partisanship, there were, and it is not surprising, party distinctions in the relative support behind the candidates. The candidate that finished fourth had only Democrat support. The candidate that finished third, Dr. Wright, had Republican support, with 1\\1/2\\ Democrat votes and a token showing across the party aisle. Two candidates, Dr. Dvorak and Father O'Brien, had significant bipartisan support, with Father O'Brien having the first showing in terms of vote totals. We did not rank these candidates. We decided not to rank them. Ranking involves making a judgment, who is the best one, who is the second best one. We thought all three were qualified individuals, but what was important was the bipartisan consensus behind them. Again, this is the chaplain of the House. It was a bipartisan process; and, therefore, the degree of consensus behind the final three is very important to us in the selection process, because this determines really the candidates that were able to capture support across the party aisle. In this respect, in my presentation to the Speaker, the Minority Leader, as they began their work of the final committee of three, I indicated that Father O'Brien had had the most support; that Dr. Dvorak had the second level of support; that Dr. Wright had the third level of support. I believed that the discussions that followed also captured this sense of consensus behind O'Brien, consensus behind Dvorak, not consensus behind Wright. So there were two meetings, as the Speaker just indicated, largely because they did not come to closure the first time. And the second time, in a divided vote, we in the minority know how divided votes go, you lose them. And the selection was made, Dr. Wright; not a consensus selection. Here is where I really hope you can understand where our hard feelings on this matter arise. We are asked to participate. We willingly participated. We cared a great deal about the chaplaincy, and we felt as though our view was ignored when the final decision was made. Majority only, once again. We felt that. We believed that. You may disagree with that interpretation, but that is what we believed. Others had another feeling as well, and that is that in the passing over of the top candidate, a Roman Catholic priest, there had to be some other motives that were at issue that were untoward. Frankly, I did not have that view. I felt that the problem was ignoring the bipartisan consensus for the candidate, that it did not have bipartisan consensus. We did not ask Dr. Wright to our caucus because Dr. Wright was not the issue for us. The process was the issue. The process was the problem. In reacting to how the Speaker has resolved this matter, we look forward to getting to know Father Coughlin, if I have the name right. He is an individual we have not met. I think we can do better than this going forward. I would ask each of us to seriously consider a resolution that will be offered this week by the gentleman from California that would call for the selection of the chaplain to be much in the same way as the selection of Inspector General. At the end of the process, two votes, two for the majority, two for the minority. This is the chaplain of the House. This individual will be our minister. This individual will be our counselor. This individual will be our friend, not just the Speaker, not just the majority, but all of us. And so next time, we will never let this happen again, next time. I would ask that we pass this resolution, changing the rules by which we deal with the chaplain and so that both sides have equal say. Perhaps my deepest regret from this is, I felt a lot of good could come from the institution of the chaplain. I still have that hope for the institution and would only echo the Speaker's comments relative to the chaplain and what the chaplain might mean to this institution. I look forward to working collectively under the newly announced chaplain and with the chaplains to come in the future, should I still be a Member of this body. I do think it might be one institution that can play an important role in restoring a greater degree of civility and trust between us.","word.count":1174,"sep11":-1.50842696629213,"years":2000.35112359551,"days":1905,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0480243711565082,"Topic 2":0.0370004823698917,"Topic 3":0.167994528550339,"Topic 4":0.707943256540401,"Topic 5":0.00531724392326495,"Topic 6":0.00630693984121187,"Topic 7":0.0051554527085352,"Topic 8":0.0126554182133279,"Topic 9":0.00570481601562366,"Topic 10":0.0038974906808975},{"id":"10519980038507","body":"Loretta Sanchez: Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the Labor- HHS-Education appropriations bill.

This amount comes from a provision that lifts the cap on the number of reverse mortgages that will be available to our seniors to help them provide for themselves where they have a high amount of equity in their homes and not a sufficient stream of income. So what this legislation would do is provide that initial income by allowing more reverse mortgages to be authorized from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Unfortunately, we did understand this is subject to a point of germaneness, but this is good public policy, and it has bipartisan support. It happens to come up with basically the amount of money that we needed to provide for both fully funding border guards and fully funding detention facilities. So my hope was that--as is the case in many appropriations bills--we set aside the issue of germaneness, and we deal with the substantive issue, which is this is good public policy and it accomplishes another good public policy, which is to provide for the border guards. I am disappointed that the point of germaneness was raised. There certainly is a point to be held here. I was hoping that it would not be raised and we could vote on the merits of the bill. I think it is an unfortunate occurrence, but the Senator has the right to make that point of order.","word.count":303,"sep11":4.96067415730337,"years":2006.8202247191,"days":4208,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.122102304248633,"Topic 2":0.393102539282519,"Topic 3":0.00324914946588479,"Topic 4":0.0767124082549346,"Topic 5":0.246697761646314,"Topic 6":0.0138153207075105,"Topic 7":0.00595285013913625,"Topic 8":0.0969435940979113,"Topic 9":0.0286065194146879,"Topic 10":0.0128175527424687},{"id":"11020070067568","body":"Harry Reid: Madam President, this should be a time of celebration, not a time of finger-pointing. In fact, the fact is, it is true that a number of recommendations the 9/11 Commission recommended we did do. But, as you know, the Commissioners themselves graded the administration on what needed to be done to implement the Commission's recommendations. That is where we get into the Es, Fs, and incompletes. So there is no question this legislation absolutely is totally necessary. Following the terrible attacks on September 11, our country turned to a respected group of Democrats and Republicans, the 9/11 Commission, an independent bipartisan Commission, to review the lessons of that tragic day and to find a better way to protect the homeland fight on the war on terrorism. Under difficult circumstances, including a lack of cooperation, in instances, from the White House, the Commission did an outstanding job. In July of 2004, it made a number of recommendations to Congress and the administration about how best to secure America from al-Qaida and other terrorist groups. Their recommendations were commonsense solutions. These commonsense solutions were designed to keep America safe. But, unfortunately, over the last 2\\1/2\\ years, many of the Commission's recommendations have been ignored, and too many of our communities remain dangerously unprepared to prevent or respond to a terrorist attack. Today, in a few minutes, the Senate will correct that mistake. We will enhance the security of our transportation system at our ports. We will provide America's first responders with the technology they need to communicate with each other when a Katrina or another terrorist attack strikes, and we will put new security requirements in place to keep terrorists from traveling to the United States. This is an important piece of legislation we are going to pass. We are going to pass it, as I said, in a short time. I thank Chairman Lieberman and his ranking member, Senator Collins, for their efforts on this bill. I said before this legislation was taken up on the floor that we have two people who set the example for how you should legislate. They got along well in their committee. When she was chairman, Senator Lieberman worked well with her, and it has worked the same way. I commend and applaud both of these legislators. They have done a tremendous job trying to work through this issue. Anything that has been slowed down in this legislation has not been their fault--in fact, quite to the contrary. They have worked tirelessly to bring this legislation here today so we can have this vote. They reported a strong bill out of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. It has only been strengthened by the amendment process before the full Senate over the past several days. Now, we do not need to redebate the issue regarding collective bargaining. Collective bargaining has been in this country for a long time, and it is here to stay. There is nothing in this piece of legislation that is in any way going to impair the security of this Nation. I wish to thank the entire 9/11 Commission for their service, but especially I wish to thank 9/11 Commissioner Tim Roemer and the 9/11 family, but especially Carol Ashley, Beverly Eckert, Mary Fetchet, and Carie Lemack, members of Families of September 11 and VOICES of September 11th. Their input in this legislation has been essential. Former Congressman Roemer spent time here on the Senate floor. No one could ever accuse Congressman Roemer of being some wild-eyed liberal. He is a moderate, and he is from the State of Indiana. He has worked very hard on the Commission and to move this legislation forward. I underline and underscore my appreciation for his input and also for the families and the two letters they wrote during the debate. Their letters served as a reminder of what this legislation is about: protecting America against terrorism. Our country will be safer, stronger, and more secure as a result of their efforts. The first responsibility of Government is to protect our people--the people of Colorado, the people of Nevada, the people of Maine, the people of Connecticut, Alabama, Nebraska, and Missouri. The Senators are here assembled, everyone in their seats. Our No. 1 job is to protect our people. By passing the legislation today, we will help ensure the Senate meets its obligation, and we will, once and for all, write the lesson of that terrible September 11 day into law. In their report to the Nation, the 9/11 Commission wrote, ``The men and women of the World War II generation rose to the challenges of the 1940s and the 1950s. They restructured the government so it could protect the country. That is now the job of the generations that experienced 9/11.'' That is what the legislation is all about. Again, I applaud and commend the two managers of the bill, those who offered amendments and debated the issue. This is good legislation, good for the country. It makes America a better place. I urge my colleagues to vote for this legislation so we can take another step to fulfilling the directives we were given by the 9/11 Commission. I yield the floor.","word.count":869,"sep11":5.64325842696629,"years":2007.50280898876,"days":4451,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0351002817534131,"Topic 2":0.0237123899091186,"Topic 3":0.0721775859595601,"Topic 4":0.147000242324196,"Topic 5":0.0127389000351874,"Topic 6":0.0163253293452716,"Topic 7":0.00348491743022004,"Topic 8":0.121370652197321,"Topic 9":0.00728187600643483,"Topic 10":0.560807825039277},{"id":"11020070041306","body":"Charles W.

Last spring, Congress passed the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001. This act provided $1.35 trillion in tax relief over the next 10 years. The death tax passed last year will be phased out over the next 9 years and will disappear completely in the 10th year. This means after December 31, 2010, the death tax will return in full, beginning January 1, 2011. In other words, if this bill is not enacted, families who lose a loved one on December 31, 2010, will pay no death tax; but families who lose a loved one on the next day will pay a massive death tax, as high as 60 percent in some cases. The death tax is perhaps the most morally reprehensible tax levied by the Federal Government. The death tax is the number one reason small business and minority- owned businesses and family farms are broken up and sold to large corporations, destroying thousands of jobs in the process. The Democrat substitute amendment would establish a fixed $3 million exemption equivalent that is not indexed for inflation. The relative value of the exemption equivalent will decrease over time as a result of inflation and more families will be subjected to the effects of the death tax. The substitute amendment eliminates the benefits of the graduated estate tax rates. The entire estate above the $3 million exemption equivalent will be taxed at 50 percent. That does not appear to sound like sound tax policy. We must vote down the Democrat substitute, pass the permanent death repeal, and guarantee the relief that we promised last spring.","word.count":289,"sep11":0.752808988764045,"years":2002.61235955056,"days":2710,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.9248267439986,"Topic 2":0.0243768015663742,"Topic 3":0.00523327199660102,"Topic 4":0.0138268673450465,"Topic 5":0.00517302431234954,"Topic 6":0.00577204970450699,"Topic 7":0.00418571156554403,"Topic 8":0.00935478133344076,"Topic 9":0.00506291817298851,"Topic 10":0.0021878300045483},{"id":"10620000026945","body":"Bill Archer: Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume Today, we take the final step toward ending the marriage penalty for 25 million married couples. That is 50 million Americans. Once again, this can-do Congress is sending common sense legislation to the President so we can help America's working families make ends meet. And once again, this Congress is bringing fairness to the Tax Code. I am proud to say that this marriage penalty relief bill is very close to the version the House passed with strong bipartisan support twice this year. In fact, it is better because we have accelerated the tax relief to married couples so that they can begin to realize a benefit this year, the year 2000, rather than having to wait under the original House bill until the year 2003. The doubling of the standard deduction, the first step in doubling the 15 percent income tax bracket, and the expansion of the earned income credit limits will all be effective retroactive to January 1 of this year. That means that when President Clinton signs this bill, millions of couples will be helped this year when they file their estimated taxes and next year during tax time when they report their tax return for this year. I honestly hope President Clinton will sign this bill because it meets what he has signaled are his primary concerns. First, it is fiscally responsible. The bill's tax relief of $89 billion is less than one-half of 1 percent of the $2.2 trillion non- Social Security surplus. Less than one-half of 1 percent. Is that too much to create fairness for families? And it is 64 percent, almost two- thirds, less than the amount of marriage penalty relief he said he could support. Second, it gives the most help to those middle- and lower-income Americans who are hit hardest by the marriage tax penalty. By doubling the 15 percent bracket and the EIC income thresholds, we erase the marriage tax penalty for millions of lower- and middle-income workers. This is especially important to working women whose incomes are often taxed at extremely high marginal rates, some as high as 50 percent, by this penalty. Finally, this bill is part of an overall budget framework that protects Social Security and Medicare, pays down the debt by 2013 or sooner, and maintains fiscal discipline and our balanced budget. Because of these actions, the President should see he now has every reason to sign this bill. If only for a brief moment, I hope he can and will put politics aside and place the needs of 25 million married couples above the needs of politicians and political campaigns. This is a kitchen table issue for families trying to make ends meet. The American people overwhelmingly support this bill, and we can do this right now. There no longer can be any delay in the other body. This is a conference report. It is an up or down vote. I hope every Member will vote ``aye'' overwhelmingly. In his January State of the Union, President Clinton stood in this Chamber and asked Congress to work with him to fix the marriage tax penalty. There were no preconditions. There was no quid pro quo, no wink, no nod, no demand for a trade; and I believe the American people do not want to see a Congress operate where if you scratch my back, I will scratch yours whether it is right or wrong. There should be no linkage or trade on an issue this important to the families in this country. It stands alone. In fact, there was only boisterous applause and cheers from both sides of the aisle when the President spoke in this Chamber and said he wanted to fix the marriage penalty. So today we fulfill our responsibility and we finish the job, and we ask that he fulfill his. Indeed, 25 million married couples should not be punished any longer just because they got married. I urge strong support for this legislation.

But she did not seek fame and would prefer anonymity. Her name is Joelle Ligon. I rise to speak about her plight, her courage and the need for this Congress to act. Joelle deserves to live her life without fear, as everybody deserves. Unfortunately, Joelle's life was turned into a nightmare because of cyberstalking. Today she is both a victim and an advocate, and she was invited to share her story the other day on ``Good Morning America.'' It was not easy for Joelle, but she knew it was important to warn America about the dangers lurking online. Joelle was 15 when she met and dated an 18- year-old young man in high school. Nothing unusual about that. Eventually Joelle severed the relationship and moved on with her life. She married and began a career. A few years later, Joelle received an e-mail one day. It was supposedly sent from a woman she did not know, but whoever sent it knew her. Then a second e-mail came with more personal details that no stranger could possibly know. Joelle began to suspect that the woman was really a man. By the third e-mail, Joelle was sure the e-mails were coming from her former high school boyfriend. She wrote back, naming him, and telling him to stop. Things went from bad to bizarre. The e- mails got much worse. They began to include pornography and threats like this: ``Not only is it bad karma to have enemies, I'm a bad enemy to have.'' Joelle was terrified. Then came phone calls in the middle of the night. Her phone number had been posted online by someone urging men to call her for sex. Joelle went to the local police, but they concluded there was nothing they could do because no law had been broken. Joelle and her husband moved to Seattle, but within months the nightmare came back. Joelle started receiving calls at work from men who had seen her number posted online in sex chat rooms. She again went to the local police and to the FBI, but nothing was done. Finally, her coworkers and supervisors received an e-mail that accused her of falsifying her employment credentials and of sexual misconduct. The city of Seattle's computer security officer, Kirk Bailey, became the white knight. He got people involved, but progress was painfully slow because no laws specifically address cyberstalking. Eventually an assistant U.S. Attorney got involved, but finding a law to deal with a 21st century crime has been tough. A break in the case came when the ex used her phone number in a chat room. Authorities acted, using title 47 of the Telecommunications Act for the first time in a case like this. The ex-boyfriend has been charged, but it has taken years and a courageous woman willing to see it through. And it is not over yet. Joelle and millions of other Americans need our help. By some estimates, one out of every 12 women in America is stalked online. The problem extends to men as well. Some States, including Washington, have acted to toughen the laws, but it is time to recognize that cyberstalking is a national problem. We are using a 20th century law to fight 21st century crime. That has to change. Cyberspace has no State borders. Cyberpredators can reach across State lines to terrorize their victims wherever they live and work. Americans like Joelle need the protection that only the Federal Government can provide. We need to modernize our laws to make sure they protect Joelle and every American. Cyberspace has opened doors we are just beginning to understand. This one, we already know. Everyone has the right to feel safe and be safe. Anything less is wrong and should be illegal with severe penalties. The first step is awareness. I am preparing a letter to circulate to my colleagues that will include newspaper accounts from Seattle about Joelle. We are going to work with the appropriate Members and committees in the House as soon as possible to tackle cyberstalking head-on. We will do what we need to do to clarify and strengthen our laws. I urge both Republicans and Democrats to join me in protecting Joelle, to join me in protecting every American. Let the predators know that they are the only ones who should not feel safe today. Joelle, you are not alone.

I thank the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma for the opportunity to go forward. I rise tonight to express my views on what has become the overriding issue before the Senate and our Nation as we close out the 107th Congress: the authorization of the use of military force against Iraq and in what context and under what circumstances such an operation might take place. This issue has been one on which I have given much thought and careful analysis. This decision quite literally has life-and-death implications, not just for our courageous men and women in uniform but for all Americans across our homeland, for your family and mine. No decision we take can weigh more heavily on our hearts and minds, particularly in light of the exposed vulnerabilities and tragic events of September 11, 2001. This is as important an issue as any of us will ever face. It requires a sober and calculating weight of the costs and benefits to our Nation. Ultimately, our decision will shape the nature of the U.S. leadership as the first among equals in the post-cold-war world, and our decision sets a precedent for ourselves and for those who take our lead in the 21st century for good or evil. No one argues that Saddam Hussein's brutal and criminal regime should be tolerated. He and his regime are evil. We all accept that Hussein uses torture and terrorism to advance his political goals. He constructs palaces while his people starve. He stockpiles biological and chemical weapons. At times, these weapons of mass destruction have been unleashed against the Iraqi people and his enemies. All of us are concerned that the Iraqi regime is seeking to develop nuclear weapons contrary to international law and U.N. resolutions. With deference to these circumstances and probable facts, the United Nations and the world community must act swiftly and decisively in response to the Iraqi threat. As my colleague Senator Kerry said earlier today: The question is not whether Saddam Hussein should be held accountable to disarm; the question is how. Should disarmament be imposed by the United States alone or with the weight of global public opinion behind it? To answer the question how, one needs to consider the context of the broader role America plays as a single remaining superpower. As I see it, America should make every effort to build a global coalition to achieve our objective of disarming Iraq. This effort should be considered our first priority in these grave circumstances. Building an international coalition will give moral authority to our challenge, share the sacrifices that will be incurred, and set a positive precedent for the future in foreign relations among nations. The benefits of working cooperatively with other countries have been a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy since the end of World War II. That is why the United States worked to create the United Nations in the very first instance. Strangely, this administration has sometimes appeared to consider multilateral support for a military campaign to be an unnecessary inconvenience. Even in light of our unprecedented international support and cooperation following the tragedy of 9/11--some 90 nations if I am not mistaken--it was only after the President delivered his September 12 speech at the United Nations that he began visible and serious outreach to the global community. This week, the President in his speech in Cincinnati went further to embrace a multilateral approach. I support what he expressed in that speech. In my view, we must reinforce his recent instincts. We all know at the end of the day the United States always retains the inherent right to act unilaterally in self-defense. With that understanding, I believe strongly we must not stop pursuing, however, the support of the world community before acting alone. The United States may be the strongest country in the world militarily. We still need allies. We need help with logistics. We need intelligence cooperation and overflight rights to help us succeed. That is in the short run. And after the military campaign is over, we will need help in the long run reconstructing Iraq and rebuilding a civil society. But if the world community is not with us when we take off, it will be hard to ask for their help when we land. Our Nation has been well served if we share the human and financial sacrifices required to prosecute the war and keep the peace, and we will be well served in the future if we follow that pattern. Unless we have the support of our allies, it will be difficult to ask them for humanitarian assistance in helping to feed, clothe, and heal the Iraqi people or reestablishing the rule of law. It will be difficult to ask for assistance for peacekeeping and nationbuilding activities. In the past, the current administration has been somewhat reticent to support these kinds of operations. As a case in point, we relied on the armed forces of other countries, for example, to restore law and order in Afghanistan. Yet if other countries had not been committed from the beginning, they would have been much less likely to participate once the fighting was over. Unilateralism also brings with us great costs--most importantly, costs in the precious lives of our men and women in uniform, people who serve us bravely. It also brings us costs as we saw in the gulf war. The United States had relatively low out-of-pocket expenses. The reason was, we had a coalition of nations. Although the Congressional Research Service notes that war cost about $80 billion, much of that was covered by allied contributions. Without allies, the United States, it is projected, will have to shoulder by itself the $100 billion to $200 billion pricetag suggested by the administration for the current war. I have seen higher estimates. It really depends on how long our participation in the peacekeeping and nationbuilding efforts will go on afterwards. It should not be lost on the American people that we are still in Korea, 50 some years after our intervention. In other words, unilateralism is expensive and its cost--crowd out other priorities on the Nation's agenda from our first responders to our first graders. Unfortunately, by authorizing force before a multilateral approach has been devised, the President's resolution provides no assurance that the world community will be actively involved in either the military campaign or, more importantly, the reconstruction efforts. In the long run, the Bush doctrine of unilateral preemption embedded in the underlying resolution would set an awful example for the world community--a precedent based on the concept of survival of the fittest. For generations, the United States has decried the aggression of foreign governments across the globe. We fought the patriotic and just fights against the Nazis and Communists who sought world domination. How in the future can we criticize Russia for attacking Georgia or stop India from taking action against Pakistan or believe Taiwan will be safe from China? Many countries may feel threats, continuing or imminent. They, too, could argue preemptive rights. The underlying resolution would codify the Bush preemption doctrine in precedent and could undermine our moral authority and leadership credibility in limiting future conflicts around the globe. Furthermore, by advancing a policy of unilateral preemption, we could be encouraging state sponsors of terrorism such as Iran and Syria to form unholy alliances with just the kinds of agents of terror that caused the horrific events of September 11. Iran, Iraq's mortal enemy, actually opposes a U.S. invasion of Iraq. Why is that? Perhaps because Iran fears that if the U.S. attacks Iraq today, we might attack Iran tomorrow. Clearly, the thawing of relations between these two U.S. adversaries should give us pause. One can only wonder what Iran's instructions to their agents of terror will be in a world where they feel threatened under a preemption doctrine. Earlier this week, Senator Graham introduced an amendment which authorized the President to use force against several identified dangerous terrorist groups, including Iranian-linked Hezbollah and Hamas. I supported that amendment because I believe that those foreign terrorist organizations represent an even higher order risk to American security than Iraq. Like al-Qaida, these organizations have the clear means of delivery. These terrorist groups may already be operating in our homeland. I am concerned that, at some level, Iraq may be a dangerous distraction from America's war on terrorism. While the United States military has certainly disrupted the activities of the al-Qaida network, no one should doubt that al-Qaida and its sympathizers continue to operate. The administration tells the American people this almost every week. These groups continue to plot ways to undermine the American way of life and our security. As the United States considers its future course of action with respect to Iraq, a potential threat, we must assure the American people that we will not be distracted from the effort to destroy a proven threat, al-Qaida and these other terrorist organizations. That should be our No. 1 priority. It certainly has been in repeated statements by the President. I am also concerned that the resolution we have before us is structured with an overly broad scope. It refers to UN Security Council resolutions that are unrelated to the primary goal of disarming Iraq and eliminating its delivery capacity of weapons of mass destruction. We must remember that the threat we feel is not from the Iraqi people but from the criminal regime's control of weapons of mass destruction. And second, because the underlying resolution refers to UN Security Council Resolution 678, a resolution that discusses the importance of returning security to the ``area,'' we may inadvertently be permitting military action beyond Iraq. Potentially, some of these structural concerns were addressed by ot","word.count":2043,"sep11":1.10393258426966,"years":2002.96348314607,"days":2835,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.179041057535623,"Topic 2":0.15829289419775,"Topic 3":0.0946064764903691,"Topic 4":0.0110733429978599,"Topic 5":0.18994958464674,"Topic 6":0.00728952855440021,"Topic 7":0.00339859612054431,"Topic 8":0.293341950932195,"Topic 9":0.00720930832283886,"Topic 10":0.0557972602016803},{"id":"10519970029749","body":"Frank Riggs: Mr. Speaker, television can take us many places, but it can't make us experience the pain and hardship people feel when they're going through difficult times. Night after night for the past several weeks, the network news shows have been filled with images from my home state of Texas and stories of how people are dealing with the drought. By now, the stories are familiar. Ground too dry for seed to take root in. Farmers having to plow under their crops. The livelihood of towns and communities literally blowing away in the wind. The drought is putting a real squeeze on farmers and ranchers trying to make a living. Economically, it's figuring to be even worse than the drought Texas went through in 1996. The bill we're voting on today will clearly not solve all of the problems people are facing because of these severe weather conditions. But it is a start, and it will put money in people's pockets quicker than any other plan being discussed in Washington. Perhaps just as important, it's a sign that we're finally getting through in convincing people that something needs to be done to help farmers in our area deal with the drought. Over the past few weeks, some people have been trying to play politics with this crisis. That is wrong. Congress and the Administration need to work together to do what's right for farmers. The government can't make it rain. But it can help farmers cope with a major national disaster. This plan is the first step in doing that, and will likely be the first of other agriculture-related proposals coming out of Congress in the coming weeks.","word.count":478,"sep11":-4.10674157303371,"years":1997.75280898876,"days":980,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0848224657917889,"Topic 2":0.192564472589043,"Topic 3":0.029944334958571,"Topic 4":0.0411100162471789,"Topic 5":0.0071200225936198,"Topic 6":0.00651689290468499,"Topic 7":0.0109958871042575,"Topic 8":0.00982680550376473,"Topic 9":0.611081948824933,"Topic 10":0.00601715348215783},{"id":"10519970045412","body":"Pat Roberts: Most critical, of course, to this is the issue of how we deal with Iran and the fact that, once again, this administration has failed to reflect effectively on the policy dealing with that nation. Iran, as we recognize, has been dominated by a fundamentalist leadership which has viewed its purpose as promoting an aggressive religious philosophy internationally. It has viewed the United States as its enemy in this undertaking. But this fundamentalism cannot survive forever. It is much like when we confronted the Communist leadership after World War II and President Truman and President Eisenhower recognized that, through the process of constructive containment, we would be able to bring down that system of government because it would fall of its own weight because at some point, after a certain period of years, the fundamental flaws of that system and that philosophy would simply undermine it and decay it from within. And that is true also of the fundamentalist movement in Iran. The Muslim religion is an extremely powerful and great religion, and it is a religion that is based on some very wonderful precepts. But the fundamentalism that captured a certain element of the Muslim believers is, as it is practiced in Iran, inherently self-destructive. If we are able to contain Iran but at the same time encourage within Iran the more moderate elements, we will, over a period of time, see, I believe, a collapse of the fundamentalist energy from within and a rising of a state which will be responsible. But this administration has passed over a series of opportunities to promote that option, which has been unfortunate. If you are going to contain Iraq, then you must understand that in the process of containing Iraq, you must neutralize Iran as a threat to the region. Because if you were to eliminate Iraq as a force within their region, you would create a vacuum into which a fundamentalist Iran would step and be a threat to its neighbors of even greater proportions--greater proportions--than Iraq is. So, reflecting adequately on how we deal with Iran, and approaching Iran as part of the solution to how we deal with Iraq, is critical, critical to the capacity to take on the Iraqi issue. Yet this administration, in my opinion, has once again left the ball on the side of the field when it comes to understanding or pursuing that course of action. So, where does that leave us? Unfortunately, where it leaves us is with a 19th century dictator who has 20th century weapons of mass destruction, in Saddam Hussein, an individual who lives by a code which is horrific to the sensibilities of a civilized world. It is a code that follows in the course of people like Adolph Hitler and Mussolini and others, who sought to promote themselves in the name of some cause which was really just superficial to their own megalomania. But our capacity to address Hussein and to be able to deal with the situation in Iraq is fundamentally undermined by our inability, one, to focus on the situation with an international alliance and, two, to have the capacity, because we do not have an international alliance, to take action which will end up being definitive. So we find ourselves with this administration stating that we are building up an arms capability to make an attack on Iraq without an alliance supporting it with a stated objective that nobody understands, because Secretary Cohen has said that a military attack will not replace Saddam Hussein, and the President said it is not our goal to replace Saddam Hussein. Secretary Cohen has stated that a military attack will not eliminate the weapons of mass destruction, and we know that to be the case. So what is the result of the military attack? There is no clear understanding as to what it is. It will not be that Saddam Hussein is replaced. It will not be that the weapons of mass destruction are eliminated. It will not be that the alliance we had in the gulf war of 1991 are being reinstated. I have no idea what the conclusion of a military attack would be. I think the unintended consequences of it will be dramatic. Some may be positive. We may successfully eliminate some weaponry that might otherwise be used against our neighbors. Some may be horrific. We may find that Saddam Hussein uses his weaponry in some other theater or some other place. It may even be here in the United States. But those are unintended consequences, because there appears to be no intended consequences. Literally, there are no intended consequences. If the intended consequence is not to replace him and the intended consequence is not to destroy the weapons, what is the intended consequence of military action? I don't know what it is. Therefore, before we go forward with a resolution in this body--and I understand that we are not going to do that this week--before we go forward with a resolution in this body, I believe we have to bring some definition to the purpose of the process. I believe, first, we have to recognize and we have to retouch our allies and our friends and people who should be our allies and our friends. We have to go back to Russia and understand their concerns. We have to go back to Turkey and understand their concerns. We have to go back to Egypt and understand their concerns. We have to go to Israel and talk about the need to get the peace process started again and to return to the concepts of Rabin as versus the concepts of Netanyahu. More important, we, as a nation, have to know what is our purpose and what is our goal. I believe our purpose and goal should be, first, to create a united approach on this to bring into the effort an alliance which is broader and more substantive than what we presently have, something more than an English-speaking alliance. Second, it must be to remove Saddam Hussein and his government. We should have as our stated goal and purpose of any military action that we intend to have a democratic government in Iraq. And, third, it should be that the weapons of mass destruction are destroyed; not that they will survive, but that they are destroyed. These should be our goals, and I hope as we move down the road to considering the issue of what we do in Iraq and before we move forward with military action that we at least get some clarity of the process, hopefully along the lines I stated. I appreciate the patience of the Chair, and I especially appreciate the patience of the Senator from Iowa.","word.count":978,"sep11":-4.71629213483146,"years":1997.14325842697,"days":763,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.809894011113589,"Topic 2":0.0641550308651689,"Topic 3":0.0134635071695625,"Topic 4":0.0299189098924491,"Topic 5":0.0137910060409016,"Topic 6":0.0134984817099881,"Topic 7":0.0106172491232828,"Topic 8":0.0238762669626527,"Topic 9":0.0146065824340255,"Topic 10":0.00617895468837996},{"id":"11020080033401","body":"Niki Tsongas: Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to be speaking on behalf of H.R. 5853, the Minute Man National Historical Park Act, which extends the boundary of the Minute Man National Park located in Concord, Massachusetts, to include historic Barrett's Farm. This bill is a simple, noncontroversial boundary adjustment of 67 acres to the current national park and enjoys the support of the National Park Service and Save Our Heritage, the nonprofit organization which currently owns Barrett's Farm. It may seem like small change, but the preservation of such a significant site is monumentally important to the history of this country. Barrett's Farm is the former home of Colonel James Barrett, the commander of the Middlesex militia during the Revolutionary War. It was also used to store the militia's munitions in the weeks preceding the Battle of Concord and Lexington. On April 19, 1775, General Thomas Gage, the commander of all British forces in North America, ordered 700 of his troops to march to Barrett's Farm and destroy these supplies. Our colonial militia learned of the British plot in advance, and Paul Revere made his famous ride, calling his fellow countrymen to arms. By the time the British reached Barrett's Farm, the colonial militia's guns were safely hidden, and Colonel Barrett had strategically positioned the militia to strike the British Army. Barrett's militia confronted British soldiers at the North Bridge in Concord, where the infamous ``shot heard 'round the world'' was fired, launching our war for independence. Through the hard work and ongoing efforts of the nonprofit group, Save Our Heritage, Barrett's Farm has been kept in excellent condition. Private donations throughout the years have been used for its upkeep and restoration. Our country is indebted to these committed people for preserving this national historical treasure. But it is time for this important location to be part of the larger Minute Man National Park so that the considerable resources and expertise of the National Park Service can be put towards the restoration and permanent preservation of this remarkable piece of Massachusetts' rich revolutionary history. It will also enable park visitors to have a more complete understanding of how and where our American Revolution began. I urge the House to pass this bill to protect Colonel James Barrett's Farm so that current and future generations can learn about the role this site played in the birth of our Nation. I want to thank Chairman Rahall and Chairman Grijalva for their leadership on this bill, and I would also like to thank all the cosponsors of this bill for their support. I urge my colleagues today to vote for this important piece of legislation.","word.count":441,"sep11":7.21348314606742,"years":2009.07303370787,"days":5010,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.746514949327888,"Topic 2":0.0844070894213396,"Topic 3":0.0183637780457605,"Topic 4":0.0390154274246368,"Topic 5":0.0187238754093806,"Topic 6":0.0175150798849644,"Topic 7":0.0146157205104219,"Topic 8":0.0319025652509988,"Topic 9":0.0203689196321107,"Topic 10":0.00857259509249873},{"id":"10820030092195","body":"Charles Grassley: Mr. President, there is an issue that my colleague from Iowa brought up that I don't want to take exception to or argue with him about.

The amendment offered by the great Senator from West Virginia is the most direct challenge the committee's work will face in this debate because it puts at issue the question not only of the approach the committee has taken in creating the Department but whether we in the Senate believe it is urgently necessary to have a Department of Homeland Security, a better organized Federal Government to protect the American people anytime soon. This amendment will retain the basic administrative structure of the Department as we have proposed, but that is all. The amendment nominally sets up the same six directorates as the Governmental Affairs Committee proposal, but that is where the similarity ends. Here is an example: We created a directorate for emergency preparedness and response. Our Committee proposal transfers six distinct agencies, or sets of programs, and includes more than seven pages of legislative text specifying the missions and operating provisions of the directorate. The parallel provision in Senator Byrd's amendment, section 134, found on page 37 of that amendment, consists of not seven pages but seven lines of text. Three creates the directorate, and four authorizes an Under Secretary to run it. But that is all. No goals, no missions, no duties, no programs, no personnel, no directorate in any real sense. That is the approach taken by this amendment for all of the directorates, with the exception of Immigration, where the amendment does not disturb our provision to transfer and restructure the Immigration and Naturalization Service. For example, our provisions regarding a new division of intelligence would immediately begin building a potent new capability to analyze all information regarding terrorist threats and disseminate the information to help prevent or protect against attacks. The Intelligence Directorate in the Byrd amendment is an empty room with a name on the door, awaiting future legislation to give it staff and purpose; and so it would remain, I fear, indefinitely, because there is no effective termination point, no effective implementation point in the amendment's structure. Section 139 of the Byrd amendment calls for the Secretary of the new Department to submit to Congress over the course of the next year a series of legislative proposals for these shell directorates, including recommendations for the transfer of authorities, functions, personnel, assets, agencies, or entities, all of which would fill them up and give them some meaning. Those recommendations are to be submitted to Congress at least 4 months apart, beginning no sooner than February 3, 2003--next year. That means that, at best, Congress would have the administration's proposals a year from now--a year to recreate proposals that we have before us today. The amendment states that Congress should take action on these proposals within 13 months of enactment of the underlying homeland security legislation. But even if this deadline were heeded, it means only that Congress would take some action. Congress could reject one or more of the proposals or vote to study the matter further. The fact is that it is very hard to bind a future Congress to do anything. So at the end of the year, under the committee's proposal, that is the deadline for this Department to be fully up and running. Thirty days after the President signs legislation under our proposal, the new Secretary would have the power to start getting the Department running. A lot of it would start rapidly, but it would all be done within a year. Within a year, under the Byrd amendment, there is nothing but the hope that Congress will react to the proposals the administration will have sent it. So with the exception of immigration functions, there would be no assurance in the end that anything would ever be transferred into the new Department. It could indefinitely remain a bare-bones proposal with no meat on its skeletal frame whatsoever.

My opposition to impeachment has nothing to do at all with Bill Clinton, but everything to do with the office of the presidency. By setting a standard which goes beyond the Constitution, and, my Republican colleagues, beyond the historic position of our party, we are, however well-intentioned, continuing our spiral toward a government subject to the whims of independent counsels and based on the frenzied politics of the moment, rather than a government of immutable principles and transcendent institutions. This is not a decision which came easy to me. It is not a position which I particularly enjoy. No one has a higher respect than I do for the gentleman from Illinois . To me he is the conscience of this House, and it causes me great pain to in any way differ from him. But I feel I have no alternative. I strongly believe that for a president to be impeached, a president of the United States to be impeached, for an election to be undone, there must be a direct abuse of presidential power. There must be a president abusing the CIA, abusing citizens with the IRS or the FBI, a crime comparable to treason or bribery. I would say to my colleagues that my position, I believe, is rooted in Republican philosophy. I go back to the Watergate hearings of 1974, when President Nixon's most eloquent defender, subsequently appointed to the United States Court of Appeals by President Reagan, Congressman Charles Wiggins, came back and testified before the committee, and said that if he were a Member of Congress today, he would vote against impeachment. But there is even a larger issue here: Where are we going as a Nation? Quite frankly, when I hear Members on the other side rise up in such opposition to this impeachment, I say, where were they during the times of Robert Bork, Clarence Thomas or John Tower? But two wrongs do not make a right. We are a Nation consumed by investigations, by special counsels. We are a Nation consumed by scandal. We are driving good people from government. What we are talking about here in this case, the President's conduct, was illegal, it was immoral, it was disgraceful, it was indefensible, but the fact is, I don't believe rises to the level of treason or bribery. The principle we are setting that in the future, all of us, anyone who assumes the office of the presidency, is subject to civil depositions, subject to lawsuits, and then to have that deposition examined and scrutinized by an Independent Counsel, how many of our former presidents would we have lost if this was the case, if this rule of law, if this principle, had prevailed in prior times, and prior times of crisis? Also, I would ask my fellow Republicans, throughout the 1980s we saw the abuses of special counsels by Lawrence Walsh and others as they went against members of the Reagan and Bush administration. We saw good people like Elliott Abrams brought down on the flimsiest of charges involving lying. All of us knew it was wrong, and we railed against it. But today somehow we are willing to apply a different standard, a different principle. That is wrong. This is a sad day for our country. It is a sad year for our Nation, because of the conduct of the President, but also because I believe that as Republicans, we have failed to rise to our obligation.

The measure calls for a statue honoring the leaders of the Women's Suffrage Movement to be removed from the crypt and put in a place of honor in the Capitol rotunda. The House must now act on this resolution. But when it is approved, this Congress will have succeeded where three others did not. In 1928, 1932, and 1950 resolutions were introduced to move the statue of Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Susan B. Anthony from the crypt. These resolutions went nowhere. But with Senator Dole's help, we were able to quickly clear a space on the calendar for this resolution to be passed. Timing is critical because we want to move the statue before the 75th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th amendment to the Constitution. That occurs on August 26, and several groups have planned ceremonies to mark the date when women earned the right to vote--and thereby gained full citizenship in our Republic. I believe the elevation of that statue is long overdue and was pleased that so many of my colleagues gave their support. The rotunda is filled with monuments to the achievements of men in American history. It is only fitting that the accomplishments of these women will also be memorialized in a place of honor. Their efforts changed the history of the United States--and the world by making Democracy ``saleable'' to every person. Mr. President, last week the 75th anniversary of Woman Suffrage task force held a press conference and discussed our resolution.

Compared to the committee budget, this substitute increases taxes by $96.6 billion in fiscal year 2007 alone, and it increases taxes also on the American people by $516.9 billion in the next 5 years. Now, I know that when you deal with numbers of this scope, it is hard for people, those of us here sometimes and people back home, to really kind of grasp what that is, put that in perspective. So I wanted to try to put what those numbers, those tax increases on the American people that this amendment proposes, what they really are like. The tax increase proposal for fiscal year 2007, again $96.6 billion, proposed by this amendment, and I have a board here that has a picture of the State of Florida, the State that I am honored to represent, and they just had a legislative session in the State of Florida. The tax increases in this amendment are larger than the entire budget of the entire State of Florida. Now, keep in mind what we are talking about. The State of Florida, the fourth most populous State in the entire country, which funds from their budget schools and housing projects and every road in the State and environmental protection, including Everglades restoration, and law enforcement and prosecutors and health care and the court system and the public defenders and the judges, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So if you get the entire budget of the entire State of Florida, it is smaller than the tax increases that this amendment proposes just in 1 year. Just in 1 year. I think that kind of puts it in perspective. But that is not all, because if you look at the tax increases proposed for the 5-year program that this amendment proposes, which is a tax increase on the hard-working American people of $516.9 billion, and I have another board, that tax increase is larger than 1 year's expenditure of Argentina, the Bahamas, Belarus, Belgium, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Egypt, Guatemala, Honduras, Jordan, Libya, Pakistan, Panama, Puerto Rico, Thailand, Uganda, Uzbekistan combined. So some people say we are spending too much money on foreign aid. No. The tax increases in this amendment over 5 years are larger than what these countries spend in 1 year for all their expenditures combined. I think that puts it in perspective. But we can go further. We can go further. Let us put the entire Western Hemisphere, this amendment is asking the taxpayers of the United States in 5 years to pay in new increased taxes more than the entire expenditures of the governments of the entire Western Hemisphere combined. Yes, Mr. Chairman. Brazil, Argentina, Panama, Belize, Jamaica, Dominican Republic, Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Haiti, Paraguay, and all the Caribbean. If you funded their expenditures for 1 year, it is still not as large as the tax increase that this amendment imposes on the American people for the next 5 years. But some people may say, Well, I do not know a lot about those countries, maybe they are just not that large. They are. But maybe they are not that large. So let me see, what is the biggest economic superpower that we hear about all the time? Let us pick China, Communist China. We know what a huge superpower it is. We know that it is an incredible monster of an economy. Let us look at what their expenditures are in 1 year, and let us compare it to the tax increases that this amendment proposes to impose on the American people in increased taxes over the next 5 years. The expenditures of China for 1 year, $424.3 billion, and yet this tax increase on the hard-working American people over 5 years is larger than that expenditure of China. But also throw on top of that the entire budget of the State of Florida, and you still have about $20 billion of wiggle room to play with. It is important to realize that there is a huge difference between these two bills. Under the budget, the following tax relief under this proposed amendment would obviously expire: the $1,000 child tax credit that all families benefit from; the 10 percent bracket, which the entire middle class benefits from; the repeal of the estate tax, which obviously would kill small businesses by that tax increase. And the worst part, though, is not only does it increase taxes to an incredible degree, it also then cuts expenditures. For example, there is no provision for supplemental funding for the combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq or even for natural disasters; so it increases dramatically taxes, but does not fund our war effort. At the same time, it cuts defense spending by $6.6 billion in budget authority and another $4.6 billion in outlays. Again, it asks to do that at a time when our men and women in uniform are in harm's way. Again, I want to thank the sponsors because it is a dramatic difference, but for all those reasons I would obviously urge a ``no'' vote. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.","word.count":235,"sep11":3.73876404494382,"years":2005.59831460674,"days":3773,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.190835623743657,"Topic 2":0.212780135658487,"Topic 3":0.0478802299918482,"Topic 4":0.0492245508782926,"Topic 5":0.268131118526411,"Topic 6":0.00632097015168724,"Topic 7":0.00487868898466373,"Topic 8":0.0360131931558717,"Topic 9":0.00805042601483361,"Topic 10":0.175885062894247},{"id":"10419960002599","body":"John Joseph Moakley: Mr. Speaker, my recent visit to Cuba has been the subject of some controversy.

I am not a lawyer, but I do not think that the law requiring us to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth means we can tell the truth that is convenient or the truth only about certain things. A lie is a lie. A lie to a grand jury and a lie in a sworn deposition is equally a lie and equally a violation of the law, whether it is about sex or whether it is about national security. Others who have lied under oath have been criminally charged. In the last 2 years, 3 people in my State of Utah have been charged, convicted and sentenced for lying under oath. They faced the consequences of their actions and they took their punishment. How can we now tell the American public that a lesser standard applies to the President of the United States, the chief administrator of the laws of this country? Some have argued that by voting for impeachment we are lowering the bar for impeachment. I disagree. I think we are instead affirming democracy as truly the cornerstone of this great country. We are saying that the American people who have, as the gentleman from Illinois so eloquently put it this morning, believed, fought and sacrificed this past 227 years for the rule of law, believe that all are subject to that law, not just the poor, the minorities or those without affluence or influence, as some cynics have claimed in recent years, but all, including the man who holds the most powerful and influential office in this country.

Mr. Chairman, I thank my good friend the gentleman from California [Mr. Miller] for his kindness in granting me this time. I want to pay tribute to the gentleman from Alaska [Mr. Young], my good friend, the chairman of the committee, with whom I have worked very hard on this legislation. I would like the House to know that this is good legislation, and I would like to tell them a little bit as to why. In my young days between about 1966 and about 1974, I was chairman of a little subcommittee called the subcommittee on fisheries and wildlife conservation. It was one of the components of the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries. It had jurisdiction overall of the national refuge system. And during that time we wrote the National Wildlife Refuge System Act of 1966. Since that time I have also served for 26 years as a Democratic Representative of the House to the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission, which is in charge of buying land for the migratory bird refuge system, and in that time the Nation has acquired over 600,000 acres of habitat for the protection of migratory birds and other wildlife. This is a great treasure and one of my principal purposes has been to protect it to assure that it would not be destroyed or dissipated. Indeed one of the early things which we confronted was an attempt by the then-Secretary of the Interior McKay to dissipate the entirety of the refuge system. That was brought to a halt, and, as a result of that, the Refuge Administration Act was put together. This legislation has been called the best piece of public land management legislation ever. Some 30 years now after that was done, I am proud to see the accomplishments which have taken place as a result of that bill. The system is now providing well-managed habitat for the protection of resident and migratory species. It is also helping to recover threatened and endangered species. It is contributing to the diversity of refuge areas, and it is serving for all of the people much more traditional and wildlife-related purposes, such as hunting, fishing, and wildlife observation. It is a system which, I would remind my colleagues, is funded in the largest part by the contributions of the hunters of this Nation who, by their purchase of duck stamps, make it possible for this Nation to acquire the lands which are set aside forever as a part of the refuge system. It is important to recognize then the inequal part that our Nation's hunters and fishermen pay--play in providing constant support for the expansion and the maintenance of our refuge system. America's sportsmen and sports women provide this help not only with their votes but also through the purchase of duck stamps, a substantial portion of the public dollars then which are expended in support of the refuge system. A few weeks ago the President expressed his support of the sportsmen community by issue of executive order. It recognizes supporting uses as a priority use of the system, and this is one of the reasons that we are able to sustain that system and to encourage patriotic sportsmen, hunters, outdoors men and women for contributing to the system. Now, I have hunted with the President, and I know of his strong interest in our refuge systems, and I am pleased that he took the initiative with this executive order. It is my hope that he will see the merits of the legislation here which codifies much of that order. H.R. 1675 is the result of some long-sought legislative improvements in the refuge system. For many years, environmentalists and sportsmen and women have called for an organic act which lays out clear purposes of the system and requires the completion of the conservation management plans for each refuge. A number of studies by the General Accounting Office and the Fish and Wildlife Service have found many problems in our refuges. These problems range from overuse to toxic contamination to a lack of proper funding and proper management. H.R. 1675 is the result of thorough examination of these problems and an attempt to make improvements of the management of the system which will require better planning, compatible uses, and a clear identification of the purposes of the system. Chairman Young last year talked to me about cosponsoring this legislation. I agreed to do so so that this body could give the Fish and Wildlife Service the tools that it needs to do the job. In fact, I decided to cosponsor this bill only after consulting with the Fish and Wildlife Service and being convinced that the bill is in the best interest of the National Wildlife Refuge System and the wildlife that it protects. I want to commend again the distinguished gentleman from Alaska for his leadership in this. This is a good bill. It is one which will make progress in terms of protecting the refuge system and one which will make real progress in terms of protecting the wildlife that are dependent upon it, and in assuring that we can continue the public support which has made possible the success of one of the greatest systems of public lands and the greatest systems of public land management for an important national purpose, and that is the protection of wildlife. There is no doubt that this bill has, I would observe, some reservations. I have worked for several months with the Fish and Wildlife Service, the Interior Department, the Council on Environmental Quality, and other organizations to address problems that they have brought to my attention. I would observe that in each instance my good friend from Alaska has been most helpful in addressing those concerns. Now, one major source of concern is the question of hunting and wildlife-dependent recreation on the system. Well, first of all, under this legislation no hunting and no refuge use can take place which is inconsistent with the purposes for which this system is set up. Remember, this system is set up and paid for in good part by the hunters of America who contribute to this. I would observe that the critics of this bill have probably in toto contributed nothing to the purchase of refuge system lands over the years. I think that tells us a great deal, that people who love it enough to put their money where their mouth is are the hunters and the sportsmen. They will use this, and they will use it in a fashion which is consistent with the purpose of the refuge and in a fashion which is consistent with the best interests of not only the habitat but also the wildlife. I would urge my colleagues to support this legislation, to understand that basic good sense and basic hunting, not only as a purpose of the refuge but also as a device for the management of the wildlife there, makes the best of good sense. This is a good piece of legislation. I urge my colleagues to support it. I tell the Members, both as a hunter and a conservationist and as one who has authored much of the legislation that relates not only to the refuge system but protection of the environment, that this is good legislation. I urge my colleagues strongly to support it. It is in the public interest, it is in the interest of the refuge system, it is in the interest of the wildlife, and future generations will thank us for passing this legislation.","word.count":150,"sep11":-6.70505617977528,"years":1995.15449438202,"days":55,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.200081664642833,"Topic 2":0.0278472483347488,"Topic 3":0.294994058398042,"Topic 4":0.00833929502117983,"Topic 5":0.294376708443987,"Topic 6":0.0467100726369164,"Topic 7":0.00454804937660189,"Topic 8":0.0981810934232844,"Topic 9":0.0181360270603889,"Topic 10":0.0067857826620179},{"id":"10820040000008","body":"Ginny Brown-Waite: Mr. Speaker, it is with a very heavy heart that I rise today to express the condolences of a grateful Nation.

Mr. Speaker, I first saw Aaron Henry in action in the 1960s, in the battle within the Democratic Party, and at the convention of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party for Equality and for Integration. In the early 1970s, I had the opportunity to work with him in Mississippi as part of what we called the Mississippi-Michigan Alliance. It was an effort to spark registration within Mississippi, and to try to make sure that all voices there were heard. During those joyful days that I spent with him at his home with his beloved family and at his drugstore on Fourth Street, I had the chance to come to know him firsthand. Aaron Henry had a dream, a dream of an integrated America, a dream where everybody counted. He lived to achieve that dream. He lived a life of good works. He was instrumental in the founding of the NAACP in Mississippi. He also, as we know, as we have heard, ran for office in Mississippi and was elected to the House of Representatives, which was a proud day for Mississippi. Aaron Henry came a good long way in his life, and America has come a considerable way on that path of an integrated America because of the likes of Aaron Henry. Today we take another step along that path. I am honored to join the gentlewoman from Nevada and the gentleman from Mississippi and the gentleman from Ohio . Mr. Speaker, I close by just briefly referring back to what I had the chance to enter into the Record after the passing of Aaron Henry. I said at that point, ``Hopefully, his native State will mourn him across its cities and its farms. He was born in its rural land, toiled in one of its important towns, and journeyed it throughout from border to border. His legacy is his hopefulness. The task now of his beloved State, of his beloved Nation, and of all of us who loved him is to keep his faith and continue his battle.'' Today, with the naming of the building in Clarksdale in his honor, it is another small step in the battle that involved and really enmeshed the life of Aaron Henry.","word.count":197,"sep11":-2.55337078651685,"years":1999.30617977528,"days":1533,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0156604591873814,"Topic 2":0.0703101550265416,"Topic 3":0.00559738629822556,"Topic 4":0.0110267452737541,"Topic 5":0.00348216537920266,"Topic 6":0.0441943517523365,"Topic 7":0.0153909021944825,"Topic 8":0.0451875819904751,"Topic 9":0.785720874823796,"Topic 10":0.00342937807380536},{"id":"10419950052333","body":"Lloyd Doggett: Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.","word.count":345,"sep11":-6.1123595505618,"years":1995.74719101124,"days":266,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.109610470990003,"Topic 2":0.0494664899809421,"Topic 3":0.591547491883608,"Topic 4":0.0908291987534516,"Topic 5":0.0241910398420434,"Topic 6":0.0291529400434455,"Topic 7":0.00997473890333626,"Topic 8":0.0689817013843382,"Topic 9":0.0151417598920332,"Topic 10":0.0111041683267989},{"id":"10920050068194","body":"Mary Landrieu: Mr. President, a Federal District Court judge in the Ninth Circuit has once again declared that the reference to God in the Pledge of Allegiance is unconstitutional.

I firmly believe that the framers of the Constitution and the First Amendment did not want to ban all references to God from public discourse when they wrote the Establishment Clause. What they wanted to prevent was the establishment of an official national religion and to keep the government from getting intimately involved in the organization of one religion over another. These references to God are ceremonial. Certainly, they do have meaning, but individuals are free to put whatever meaning on the word they choose. Indeed, I fully respect and support the rights of people not to participate in the Pledge or in ceremonial prayer and my amendment will not coerce anyone to recite the Pledge of Allegiance in public or in school. I had hoped that the Supreme Court, which took the Newdow case up on appeal, would have settled this question once and for all. It did not. The Court dismissed the case saying Mr. Newdow lacked standing. The Supreme Court may have the opportunity to hear arguments in this case later on. If the Supreme Court should decide not to hear the case or to overrule the lower court, then Congress should restore the appropriate balance between church and state that I believe was the intent of the framers. I urge my colleagues to support this joint resolution and I ask unanimous consent that the text of the resolution be printed in the Record. There being no objection the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows.","word.count":414,"sep11":4.1123595505618,"years":2005.97191011236,"days":3906,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.123649073002306,"Topic 2":0.0146176753839387,"Topic 3":0.00318164461244223,"Topic 4":0.00408462834165371,"Topic 5":0.0753977297376261,"Topic 6":0.00305169156065185,"Topic 7":0.163112188348761,"Topic 8":0.113088995735388,"Topic 9":0.0536089867420129,"Topic 10":0.446207386535219},{"id":"10820040006173","body":"Steven Rothman: Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Greek Independence Day and to thank our colleagues, Mr. Bilirakis and Mrs. Maloney, who have once again shown great leadership in their efforts to organize this special order for Greek Independence Day. I would like to honor not only this important day in Greek history, but the strong and unique relationship that exists today between the United States and Greece. The evolution of modern democracy has its roots in ancient Athens, and as such, it is only fitting that we, as representatives of one of the world's great democracies, pay tribute to the Greeks and their historical contribution to democratic governance on this 183rd anniversary of their independence. Since the people of Greece declared their independence on March 25, 1821, our two nations have enjoyed close relations, and generations of Greek immigrants have helped to strengthen and enrich the relations between our two countries. As the Congressional Representative for thousands of Greek Americans, I salute their motherland's eight-year struggle for independence from the Ottoman Empire. Our countries' shared histories of fighting for our freedom and sovereignty creates a common bond between the United States and Greece. Today, the United States' relationship with Greece continues to grow stronger. Greece has been a devoted supporter of the U.S. in every major international conflict of this century and plays an important role in both the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization . Greece has been one of our most loyal allies throughout our war against terrorism and has assisted the Coalition in both Iraq and Afghanistan by providing a military presence on land, sea and in the air. In turn, the United States has worked to attain a peaceful settlement to the conflict in Cyprus, the island nation that was brutally invaded by Turkey thirty years ago. I was saddened to see the UN-sponsored negotiations break down recently, so soon before Cyprus's impending accession to the EU on May 1st, but I will continue my efforts to see this important matter through to its successful resolution. On this celebratory day of freedom and independence, I also want to heartily congratulate the Greek nation on the honor of hosting the Olympic Games in Athens this summer. I cannot think of a more meaningful place to celebrate the spirit of extraordinary achievement than in Athens, nearly 2,780 years after the first Olympics were held in ancient Greece. I look forward to sharing in the pride and celebration of the Olympic Games as they take place this summer and I look forward to continuing to work with leaders from the Greek community as we persist in our fight for a free and united Cyprus.","word.count":449,"sep11":2.60112359550562,"years":2004.4606741573,"days":3368,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.843195821609459,"Topic 2":0.0598119867399872,"Topic 3":0.0100764504702605,"Topic 4":0.0234359869491272,"Topic 5":0.0109660721925202,"Topic 6":0.0107682250265214,"Topic 7":0.00923660704034111,"Topic 8":0.0167446344049933,"Topic 9":0.0112878266405637,"Topic 10":0.00447638892622692},{"id":"10419960015174","body":"Robert E.

Now, this is the same Congress that voted overwhelmingly to lift the arms embargo so that the Bosnian Muslims could get arms from wherever to defend themselves.

Our intention is to continue to press the Sudanese Government and rebel groups to honor the Abuja peace agreement reached on May 5 in Nigeria. We hope that this legislation will help bring about peace in the region. Mr. President, I will ask animous consent to have printed in the Record the following letters from the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, the American Jewish Committee and the Archdiocese of Portland, OR. Tragically, despite the Abuja peace agreement, the conflict in the Darfur region of Sudan has continued unabated throughout this spring and summer. The Janjaweed, a government supported militia, continues to attack innocent citizens and the government is unable, or unwilling, to stop this brutality. This violence has led to an increasingly--dire humanitarian situation. More then 3 million people are dependent upon humanitarian assistance. Imagine the entire state of Oregon, which has three and a half million citizens, dependent upon humanitarian aid. This is what we face in Darfur today. I commend the Bush administration for the work it has done in bringing about the Abuja peace agreement. America has been extraordinarily generous in providing over $1 billion worth of humanitarian assistance to those suffering in the region. Yet more must be done to bring an end to the conflict and give the Sudanese people a chance to live a normal life. The Peace in Darfur Act of 2006 seeks to increase the prospect of full implementation of the Abuja peace agreement and address the unmet humanitarian needs in Darfur. The bill supports the deployment of a United Nations peacekeeping force to Darfur, intensifying the international pressure on the Government of Sudan to comply with the agreement and allow in U.N. peacekeepers. This bill also codifies existing sanctions and calls for additional targeted sanctions on Sudan's leaders. While the African Union Mission in Sudan has performed admirably under difficult conditions, a stronger force must be deployed to provide stability, allow refugees to return to their homes, and restore some semblance of normalcy to those affected by the fighting. Section 4 of our legislation calls upon the Government of Sudan to allow a United Nations peacekeeping force into Darfur to achieve these important objectives. Section 4 of our legislation also assigns the special envoy for Sudan, authorized in the fiscal year 2006 supplemental appropriations bill, the task of supporting the peace process. The urgency of this situation demands a constant level of attention at the highest level of our government, a task that the special envoy can facilitate. Section 5 of the bill codifies sanctions against Sudan that were imposed by Executive Order 13067. Codifying these sanctions will send a strong message to the Sudanese government that signing the peace agreement is not sufficient--we expect their full compliance and cooperation to bring about a peaceful resolution to the ongoing conflict. Section 6 of the bill requires the State Department to issue a report on the implementation of the Darfur Peace Agreement and a description of the humanitarian crisis. It also calls for the President to report on the international community's efforts to support the peace process and address humanitarian shortfalls. I believe this will hold accountable those countries that are actively undermining the peace agreement. If the President certifies that the Government of Sudan is implementing the peace agreement and has agreed to allow the presence of a U.N. peacekeeping mission, then the legislation requires the President to request recommendations to further the peace process from the special envoy for Sudan. However, if the President finds the Sudanese Government is impeding the peace process, the bill calls for the President to impose additional measures against Sudan, including enacting targeted sanctions on the Sudanese leadership and their immediate families. Section 7 requires a State Department report on those companies investing $5 million or more in Sudan. This information can then be used to deter investment groups, retirement funds, and others from investing in corporations doing business in Sudan. The legislation requires the Department of the Treasury to issue a report summarizing the assets of Sudanese leaders in the United States and elsewhere. This report will give a full accounting of the Sudanese leaders' assets and will allow the Department of the Treasury to take actions on these assets. Finally, section 8 of the legislation authorizes $150 million for humanitarian needs in Darfur","word.count":742,"sep11":5.01966292134831,"years":2006.87921348315,"days":4229,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0225884780555812,"Topic 2":0.315933534176265,"Topic 3":0.294545037929579,"Topic 4":0.039922242980566,"Topic 5":0.0301979140503806,"Topic 6":0.00616155764959873,"Topic 7":0.00348179259176685,"Topic 8":0.0150736704294492,"Topic 9":0.00665141639191543,"Topic 10":0.265444355744899},{"id":"11020080050728","body":"David Vitter: I thank the Chair. That McConnell-Domenici amendment included a number of measures, something very similar to my proposal with regard to the Outer Continental Shelf. It would have dramatically expanded our domestic supply. It would have done something real, concrete and meaningful and have a significant impact over time on the price at the pump. Yet again, the Senate refused to act, refused to move forward with that significant proposal that would do major things on the supply side and would couple it with other actions we are taking and further actions we need to take on the demand side. Instead, we did something extremely modest. We said: For now, we are not going to continue to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. I supported that move. It is true that will free up 70,000 barrels of oil to put into the open market versus pumping into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but that is very modest. That is hardly going to make a dent on the price at the pump. In contrast, all the provisions of the McConnell-Domenici amendment, all that extra supply domestically would have meant 3 million barrels in contrast to 70,000. Yet again, the Democratic leadership and the Senate overall refused to act, refused to address this issue, the most serious that Americans are facing today, the one that hits their pocketbook over and over, causing them real concern about their family budget and how they are going to make it. I urge the Senate to get out of this do-nothing attitude. I urge the Senate to act on this crucial issue for all American families. Again, this is not brain surgery. This is economics 101, supply and demand. It is not either/or. We need to do everything we can to lessen demand, and I support those measures to increase efficiency, to increase efforts at conservation, to increase new technology efforts that will lead us to new fuel sources. That is absolutely necessary. But it needs to be coupled with action to increase supply, particularly domestic supply, by tapping those vital reserves, particularly on our Outer Continental Shelf. I join the Senator in Texas in asking, if we are not going to do it now at $3.76 a gallon, when are we going to act? Are we going to wait for $4? Are we going to wait for $5? We need to act now. This is a serious issue for all Americans. This hits the pocketbook of every American family. We need to act now. We need to act not with political demagoguery, not with pure rhetoric.

Shirley, who passed away on October 20, 2005, was one of this country's last great jazz vocalists, one in the triumvirate of ElIa Fitzgerald and Carmen McRae. Her luminous voice gave rise to whispery vocals that made songs lucky to be sung by her. Many fans noted that her songs simply melted in the air. She was a giant in the world of music and will forever remain an icon of American culture. I had the privilege of sharing my memories of her at her memorial service last year, surrounded by her family and countless friends. Shirley was born here in Washington in 1934 and started her career in music at the age of ten on her grandmother's piano, unaware of the impact she would have on the world. She studied music at Howard University and was invited to attend the prestigious Juilliard School in New York. While financial difficulties at home kept her from Juilliard, they did not impede her spirit and drive. While she started as a piano virtuoso, she was seventeen when she was coaxed into singing at a Washington, DC club called One Step Down. A customer promised her a turquoise teddy bear if she would sing ``My Melancholy Baby.'' Shirley said she was so shy, but she wanted that teddy bear enough to sing the song. It was none other than Miles Davis and Quincy Jones who plucked her from that local club to international fame, and the story is worth repeating. Miles called her out of the blue after the release of her very first album, ``Embers and Ashes,'' and asked her to open for him at the Village Vanguard in New York. Not surprisingly for a young artist, she thought it was a joke and did not believe it until she went to New York and actually heard Miles's children singing from the album. Miles and his trumpet later joined a concert of hers but would not come out from behind a pillar while playing ``My Funny Valentine.'' With encouragement from Miles and Quincy, two other jazz icons, Shirley went on to record over two dozen albums and was lauded with numerous awards. After seven consecutive Grammy nominations, she won in 1998 for best jazz vocal performance. It was fitting that the winning album was ``I Remember Miles,'' a tribute to her mentor and friend, Miles Davis. I cannot think of a more fitting honor for Shirley and Miles. But her contributions to music go far beyond one album. On recordings for Verve Records, she collaborated with Miles Davis, Wynton Marsalis, Gary Bartz, and Toots Thielman. She even recorded the soundtrack for the movie ``For Love of Ivy.'' The person who asked her to do the soundtrack was the star of the film, Sidney Poitier. She also recorded a tribute album to Ray Charles called ``Here's to Life, Light out of Darkness.'' She also was elected into the Lionel Hampton Jazz Hall of Fame, received an honorary doctorate from Berklee College of Music, and won the 2003 Jazz at Lincoln Center Award. Importantly, she never forgot her family or her background. She lived mainly in Washington during the early part of her career so that she could take care of her daughter. Recording equipment and jazz legends like Elvin Jones came to her house to record albums. She even remembered how one person could make a difference in the lives of others. Just as Miles recognized her talent and took her under his wing, Shirley reached out to a young drummer named Aaron Weiman and took him under her wing. And none other than pianists-singers Diana Krall and Norah Jones count her as mentors. I again express my deepest sympathies to her family and urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this resolution.","word.count":580,"sep11":3.48314606741573,"years":2005.34269662921,"days":3682,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0110000000251246,"Topic 2":0.04071485267329,"Topic 3":0.00306272505609925,"Topic 4":0.00283050350134607,"Topic 5":0.00136333847401945,"Topic 6":0.113082260479745,"Topic 7":0.0656009091549827,"Topic 8":0.00404483630976891,"Topic 9":0.757043415293186,"Topic 10":0.0012571590324379},{"id":"10720020010628","body":"John Sununu: Reclaiming my time, Mr. Chairman, the gentleman is willing to rescind all the tax cuts that are in effect this year.

And that rule was only rescinded under this majority. Now, my Democratic colleagues are absolutely correct in saying we do not have a stand-alone vote on this issue today.

DeFazio: Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. Mr. Chairman, I think those listening to the debate are perhaps becoming a bit confused. We have heard from the esteemed chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary how these secret agreements and the antitrust exemptions will lead to a freer market, more competition, benefit all shippers, particularly possibly maybe smaller shippers and others, and those who have been listening to the debate have heard the opposite from this side of the aisle. I guess that is a good argument to basically withdraw this bill and go back to the committee of jurisdiction on which I sit and hold a hearing. It would be nice to hear from the broad interests that are going to be impacted by this bill in some detail how they believe this will affect American ports, American shippers, American workers, and the American maritime industry, such as it is. But no hearings were held and none will be held before this bill is voted on. That is absurd, for something that has such a tremendous economic impact, or potential impact on this country. I respectfully disagree with the prior speakers on that side of the aisle. I believe that antitrust immunity linked to secret, nonpublished tariffs and rates will lead to an anticompetitive environment, an environment that is particularly to the disadvantage of small- and medium-sized shippers and the businesses which they serve. I believe that this will also bring about problems for medium-sized and smaller ports in America. I do not believe a country that concentrates all of its shipping in two or three large ports is a healthy nation, particularly a maritime nation such as the United States of America. So for those Members who represent States which contain medium-sized or smaller-sized ports, if they do not represent a megaport, this bill in all probability will deprive their port, their State, of vital interests and of carriage through those areas. That means job loss, competitive loss, competitive disadvantage for their States. Beyond that, I disagree also, Mr. Chairman, on the fact that this will somehow disadvantage the foreign cartels; to have antitrust immunity, and secret agreements, and no transparency, and no publication of rates and tariffs is somehow going to disadvantage foreign cartels, who are right now trying to drive American shippers out of business and trying to channel business through a few select ports. No, I do not believe this bill is going to help that situation. In fact, I believe it is going to make it worse. There is only one remedy. We can get the savings proposed here by eliminating the Maritime Commission. We can get the savings and the efficiency that underlie other parts of this bill, and we can maintain competition, maintain a viable environment for small shippers, medium shippers, small ports, medium ports if the bill is amended with the Oberstar amendment, which the chairman of the full committee objects to vehemently.

But absent a hearing, I think we should act in a way that is prudent to protect America's interests and the diversity of interests in this country by adopting the Oberstar amendment.

That report was the first official mention of AIDS, although the disease had no name at the time. Since 1981, AIDS has become an international human catastrophe, killing more than 25 million people, orphaning more than 15 million children, and infecting more than 65 million people. Today, there are 40 million people living with HIV. This issue affects us on both a global and a domestic scale. There are over 1.2 million people in the United States living with HIV/AIDS, and there are over 40,000 new infections each year. While the United States made great strides to contain the disease and reduce the number of deaths throughout the 1990s, it now appears that this trend is reversing. The death rate is beginning to destabilize, and the infection rate is growing at a staggering rate among certain populations, particularly people of color. African Americans have the highest AIDS case rates of any racial or ethnic group--more than nine times the rate for Whites. There is still much to be done in the United States to combat HIV/ AIDS, but the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the rest of the world, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, is truly devastating. In my role as ranking member of the Africa Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I have seen firsthand the devastation this disease has caused in Africa. Africa has accounted for nearly half of all global AIDS deaths, and it is estimated that by the year 2025 the total number of HIV infections in Africa could reach an astounding 100 million. In some African countries, the disease has caused the average life expectancy to drop below 40. HIV/AIDS has ravaged countries, economies, and families. The most vulnerable in our global society are in many cases those who are most at risk from HIV/AIDS. Women and girls, who in Africa are often left physically, economically, and politically vulnerable, suffer disproportionately from HIV/AIDS. Nearly 60 percent of all people living with HIV in Africa are women; girls in sub-Saharan Africa aged 15 to 19 are infected by HIV at rates as much as five to seven times higher than boys their age. Gender inequalities, cultural norms, transactional sex, and all forms of violence against women and girls increase their susceptibility to HIV/AIDS. Women and girls desperately need legal protection and economic empowerment so that they can make safe health choices. These are fundamentally connected issues. There is some cause for hope in our battle against this terrible disease; the United States has committed an unprecedented amount of money to the fight, and we are beginning to see some results. This is no cause for complacency, however. According to a recent U.N. report, while the spread of HIV/AIDS appears to be slowing down worldwide and some countries are reporting progress in bringing the pandemic under control, others are failing to reach key targets for prevention and treatment. Most troubling is the fact that the rate of new HIV infections dramatically outpaces current efforts to reach people with life- sustaining antiretroviral therapy. According to Family Health International, for each new person who received antiretroviral therapy in 2005, another seven people became infected. We must bring increased focus to prevention efforts and do a better job of reaching out to those who are most vulnerable to this disease. It is also becoming increasingly clear that we cannot address HIV/ AIDS in isolation and that we need to deepen coordination between HIV/ AIDS initiatives and other development goals. HIV/AIDS does not just affect isolated individuals but families, communities, and entire economies. One problem that has become apparent as we commit increasing funds to address HIV/AIDS is that international AIDS programs are siphoning off trained local health care workers from national health care systems. The World Health Organization has reported that the total number of health care workers per 1,000 people in Africa is 2.3--less than one-tenth the density in the Americas. This ``brain drain'' issue must be addressed. We need to strengthen national health and social systems by integrating HIV/AIDS intervention into programs for primary health care, mother and child health, sexual and reproductive health, tuberculosis, nutrition, and education. Not only will it be more cost-efficient to work with existing systems, but it will also increase access for people who otherwise might not seek out counseling, testing, or treatment. As we look ahead to the next 5, 10 years and beyond, strong national health systems will be crucial for sustainability. The 25-year anniversary of this terrible disease is an opportunity to take stock of where we have been and to renew our commitment to overcoming the challenges that lie ahead in the fight against HIV/AIDS.","word.count":805,"sep11":4.85955056179775,"years":2006.7191011236,"days":4172,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.115881030388797,"Topic 2":0.0323940606272686,"Topic 3":0.0282902517680923,"Topic 4":0.0112649907504883,"Topic 5":0.0613856346481797,"Topic 6":0.280044741857314,"Topic 7":0.00652336015372322,"Topic 8":0.0220291242049449,"Topic 9":0.435974669464852,"Topic 10":0.00621213613634109},{"id":"10920060057646","body":"Debbie Stabenow: Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Senior Nutrition Act, which will make needed improvements to the Commodity Supplemental Food Program to prevent our seniors from having to make the difficult choice between food and medicine as they try to balance their budgets. I am pleased to have the support of my friend, Senator Domenici of New Mexico, who has been one of the Senate's strongest supporters of CSFP. Also I am pleased to have the support of Senators Johnson and Durbin. Nationally, 32 States and the District of Columbia participate in CSFP, which works to improve the health of both women with children and seniors by supplementing their diets with nutritious USDA commodity foods. According to USDA, more than half a million people each month participated in CSFP during fiscal year 2005, with the overwhelming majority being seniors. My State of Michigan has one of the largest and oldest CSFP network in the Nation. Last year, over 80,000 people in Michigan benefited from this important program. The bill I am introducing today will make the following important changes to CSFP. First, categorical eligibility is granted for seniors for CSFP if the individual participates or is eligible to participate in the Food Stamp Program. No further verification of income would be necessary in such cases. The Food Stamp Program provides a medical expense deduction, which seniors may use to account for their high prescription drug costs. Second, this bill says that the same income standard that is currently used to determine eligibility for women, infants, and children in CSFP--185 percent of the poverty income guidelines--would be applied to seniors as well. The current income eligibility standard for seniors has been capped at just 130 percent. Under the current Federal poverty guidelines, a single senior cannot earn more than $12,740 per year to qualify. By raising the standard to 185 percent of poverty, the same senior can earn as much as $18,130 to qualify for food. This will make a major difference in the lives of so many seniors who are struggling with the high cost of prescription drugs. This bill has been endorsed by the National CSFP Association as well as several national and Michigan senior advocacy and faith-based groups. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of these support letters be printed in the Record following my remarks. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: S. 3762.

Yet, this amendment clearly attempts to constrict the interpretation of the Washington treaty rendered by its founding fathers. And, let us not underestimate what kind of example passage of this amendment would set for our Allies. It would encourage our European Allies to impose their own unilateral reinterpretations or restrictions upon the Washington treaty. Imagine our reaction, if one of the parliaments or governments of our allies were to attach such conditions to NATO enlargement. How would we react, if for example, one ally were to prohibit the use of NATO-designated units against Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq? Judging from recent events in the Persian Gulf, I imagine the reaction in this chamber would be one of complete outrage. Mr. President, we must also be aware of the message this amendment would send to our European Allies should the Senate make the profound mistake of accepting it. For years, the United States, and especially the United States Congress, has worked arduously to make our European Allies more outward looking in their security policies and to assume a greater share of the risks and burdens in addressing common challenges and threats. We have repeatedly called upon them to stop the decline of their defense establishments and to devote the resources that will enable them to better contribute to the transatlantic security. Yet this amendment, perhaps inadvertently, would signal that the business of NATO is only territorial defense, and no more. It would thereby eliminate any motivation for the Allies to field the forces necessary for post-Cold War missions. It would serve as an excuse to let the military establishments continue an over decade long decline. Worse, this amendment would infer that the United States views the Alliance as having limited value in the post-Cold War era. This is an important point made by David Gompert, and I fully agree. Passage of this amendment could be interpreted by our allies and the detractors of the Alliance that the United States no longer regards its vital interests as being best secured through the fabric of the transatlantic community and the NATO alliance. That would be a dangerously counterproductive message--a message that would ignore the lessons of two world wars and the Cold War. I just don't believe that our memory is so short. Mr. President, the Senate must reject this amendment. As I stated earlier, at its best, this amendment is redundant and unnecessary. At its worst, it is a radical and dangerous departure from the Washington Treaty of 1949 and the way in which the United States has over the years used the Alliance to advance our own national interests.","word.count":469,"sep11":-3.45505617977528,"years":1998.40449438202,"days":1212,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.00492902831497023,"Topic 2":0.188135638218203,"Topic 3":0.206113804805443,"Topic 4":0.0026389491165048,"Topic 5":0.523815125930684,"Topic 6":0.00326649439621945,"Topic 7":0.0020245841678407,"Topic 8":0.037964318619874,"Topic 9":0.00408777415502706,"Topic 10":0.0270242822752342},{"id":"10720010068917","body":"Tom Daschle: Mr. President, 4 days ago, our military began strikes against terrorist training camps and the Taliban's military installations in Afghanistan. They are intended to disrupt the network of terror that spreads across Afghanistan. But these strikes are one part of a much larger battle. The network that we seek to disrupt and ultimately destroy often operates without borders or boundaries. Its tools are not simply the weapons it chooses to employ. And its trails are more often electronic than physical. This is a new kind of battle. Winning it will require a new set of tools . . . And winning is the only acceptable outcome. Just as we are committed to giving our men and women in uniform the tools and training they need to do what is asked of them, we must now make that same commitment to our justice and law enforcement officials. After all, we are now asking them to do nothing less than protect the American people by finding, tracking, monitoring--and ultimately stopping--any terrorist elements that threaten our nation or our citizens. I believe that by passing this measure today, we are taking a swift and significant step toward doing just that. We are also demonstrating, once again, that the Senate can work both quickly and effectively when we work cooperatively. I want to thank Senator Lott, Chairmen Leahy, Graham and Sarbanes, as well as Senators Hatch, Shelby, and Gramm for their leadership on this bill. I especially appreciate Chairman Leahy's management and handling of this important and delicate process. I also want to thank the many other Democratic and Republican Senators whose insights and suggestions improved this legislation. For example, Senator Kennedy's input on provisions regarding immigration addressed concerns a number of us had about the detention of legal permanent residents with only few due process protections. And Senators Enzi, Leahy and Dorgan were able to improve a provision regarding unilateral food and medical sanctions in a way that avoids needlessly hurting American farmers. I'll be honest, this bill is not perfect, and I hope that we will be able to work with our House colleagues in the days ahead in order to improve it. Whenever we weigh civil liberties against national security, we need to do so with the utmost care. Among other things, I am concerned about the provisions within this bill that allow the sharing of information gathered in grand juries and through wiretaps without judicial check. And, as we give the administration new legitimate powers to wiretap under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, I believe we should do more to protect the rights of Americans who are not suspects or targets of investigations. These flaws are not insubstantial, but ultimately the need for this bill outweighs them. When it comes to an issue as central to our democracy as the protection of our people, we must act. This bill does several important things: First, it will enhance the ability of law enforcement and intelligence agencies to conduct electronic surveillance and execute searches in order to gather critical information to fight terrorism. Second, it will permit broader information sharing between traditional law enforcement and foreign intelligence officers. Third, it will increase the Attorney General's ability to deport and detain individuals who support terrorist activity. I should note, though, that the Senate bill requires the Attorney General either to bring criminal or immigration charges within seven days after taking custody of an alien or relinquish custody. Fourth, this bill also takes significant steps to increase law enforcement personnel on our northern border. For example, it would triple the number of Border Patrol, Customs Service, and INS inspectors at the northern border, who would work in concert with their Canadian counterparts in order to enhance security in this previously understaffed area. Fifth, thanks in large part to Senator Leahy's hard work, this bill makes major revisions to the Victims of Crime Act--by strengthening the Crime Victim Fund and expediting assistance to victims of domestic terrorism. Sixth and finally, the Banking Committee was able to agree on, and add to this bill, several significant counter money laundering measures. If we are to truly fight terrorism on all fronts, we must fight it on the financial front as well. As you can see, this is a complex piece of legislation. But its aim is simple: to give law enforcement the tools it needs to fight terrorism. It was a month ago on this day that we suffered the worst terrorist attack in our Nation's history. In the days since, we have honored the memories of the more than 6,000 innocent men and women who lost their lives on that terrible day. Hours ago, for example, we passed a resolution that designates September 11 as a national day of remembrance. But I believe that to truly honor those whose lives were lost, we must match our words with action, and do all that we can in order to prevent future attacks. This bill is a significant step towards keeping that commitment, and keeping Americans safe.","word.count":839,"sep11":0.0842696629213483,"years":2001.94382022472,"days":2472,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.164800853927169,"Topic 2":0.436423567350745,"Topic 3":0.0638326767833726,"Topic 4":0.0169944004788348,"Topic 5":0.131635358233913,"Topic 6":0.0143605803995052,"Topic 7":0.0919382747131589,"Topic 8":0.0650726919718137,"Topic 9":0.00853220689233337,"Topic 10":0.00640938924915468},{"id":"10419950140164","body":"Tom Daschle: I will yield when I finish.

If the private sector is telling us not once, not twice, but on five different analyses done about economic growth in the future, if they are all telling us, look, you are missing something here, we think it is a lot better because of what you have been doing, it is going to be a lot better than 2.3 percent, why not consider it? Why not think about it? Why not privatize economic growth? If we are privatizing everything else, let us privatize this, too. Because if we privatize it, we are going to be in a lot better position to better understand the implications of all this than we are right now. So, Mr. President, that is what this is about. I am very, very disappointed that we have not been able to resolve our differences on the continuing resolution at least. We will have more to say about the balanced budget, but let me just emphasize we have all voted for a balanced budget. Many of us have voted for a balanced budget in 7 years. But to say under any condition you just have to accept the fact that it is going to be 7 years and we will fill in all the blanks later makes me very, very skeptical, frankly. The Republicans have been very uneasy about the fine print in that 7 years, and now we want to get on to the large print. I think we have to go back to the fine print and look at exactly what we are talking about in 7 years. I hope we can agree to 7 years at some point. But if we do or if we do not, before we are called upon to vote on a 7-year budget, I hope everyone understands it is like buying a house from the curb. We look at it from a distance and it looks like a nice house. It looks like a great house. But what happens when you walk inside? Is it a money pit? Is it a house of horrors? What will that house include? Does it have a roof? Does it have a basement? What will be the definition of this house? What will be the design? That is something we are going to start working on tomorrow. As early as tomorrow the reconciliation package will be before us. If we have some concern about what this house looks like, maybe it is for good reason, because we have already seen the Senate-passed and the House- passed reconciliation bills. We know what they look like. We know that they cut $270 billion out of Medicare for tax cuts totaling over $200 billion. We know that. We know they cut over $185 billion out of Medicaid. We know that. We know they have made deep cuts in education. There is a room we ought to look at. Let us walk into the education room for a minute. There on one side of the room I see a lot of cuts directly affecting school programs. I see a loss of student loans to college students. I see a whole array of losses in the education room that I am not prepared to accept. Then I walk into the working person's room, and I find dramatic cuts in the earned-income tax credit, almost a complete demolition of the EITC. So the more I walk through this house, Mr. President, I have to tell you it is a house of horrors, and that is why we are very skeptical about whether or not signing on to this house from the curb makes a lot of sense to us regardless--regardless--of whether or not we agree on an amendment by a date certain. I know a lot of people have asked to speak, and the distinguished Senator from Alaska sought recognition for purposes of yielding for a question. I will be happy to do that. Let me just again state my motive here. [[Page S 17119]] Our motive is simply to say let us have that debate tomorrow. Let us have it on Friday when reconciliation comes. Let us get into next week if we have to, but let us at least agree that the thousands of people-- the thousands of people--who are not getting the services that they expect from their Government, services they have paid for in their hard earned taxes, that at least that much we can agree on, that we are going to give those services back to the people who expect them. This amendment provides that. And I hope it will enjoy broad bipartisan support.","word.count":825,"sep11":-5.97191011235955,"years":1995.88764044944,"days":316,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.33913633752996,"Topic 2":0.287654681893814,"Topic 3":0.0599304586476141,"Topic 4":0.157679718981166,"Topic 5":0.02959164819917,"Topic 6":0.0133592365977617,"Topic 7":0.0202673809631559,"Topic 8":0.028832307256456,"Topic 9":0.054473188076527,"Topic 10":0.0090750418543755},{"id":"10920050076981","body":"John Warner: Mr. President, I strongly support the Chambliss amendment.

Mr. Speaker, I was listening to my colleague and friend from Arkansas and my friend and leader on this issue from New Jersey . Let me say to my good friend from Arkansas , I am from the fourth largest city in the Nation and when it comes to the crisis in prescription drug benefits, take a rural area with 3,400 people and no mass transit and take an urban center, and that is the nature of the crisis, and that is what it is all over this country. What I would like to say to my friend as well, I am a supporter of family pharmacies and family pharmacists because we have a few in our community and I thank the gentleman very much. I had the opportunity to visit with a number of pharmacists who have come up to try and discuss various issues, and I say pharmacists who open these local family pharmacies, and they have been very sensitive to the plight of our seniors to the extent that I know. And I know that my good friend, the gentleman from Arkansas , has probably yielded a little to some of the seniors who have come into his store and probably had their request or their prescription drugs on credit for a while so that they could manage to keep their health where they did not find themselves in hospitals. So my hat is off to the gentleman and off to the family pharmacies around the Nation. I want people to know that this is not an issue of your family drug store or your neighborhood drug store where you go into the pharmacists who try to do the best they can with the prescription that the senior has. It is a national crisis that we have, and that is why I thought it was important that we again raise our voices and speak to this question of why we have not been able to make headway on this. I wanted to refresh our memory and I am also reminded of the idea of changing Medicare for these times. Let me say that whenever Medicare is discussed, we do not make friends. I believe in 1965, whatever the time frame when Medicare first was established under President Johnson, there were a lot of people in the health care industry, good friends of ours, of course, that is senior to me, but in any event, individuals in the medical profession that thought that Medicare was not going to work; it was going to collapse the system. How in the world are you going to have a government system to pay physicians? There was a great fear and debate about Medicare. Now we find out that Medicare has extended the lives of seniors. And when it works right for the purpose our physicians, it is a system that provides better health care and the opportunity for our physicians to treat the elderly in a way that gives them a longer life. Now we talk about reforming Medicare in a way that is long overdue, and I want to refresh my colleagues' memory, if we could, and refer back to the State of the Union in 1999. Now we have been talking about this for a very long time, but usually when things get elevated to the level of the State of the Union, then the Congress takes its lead, begins to formulate policies in a bipartisan manner. And it was in January 1999 when President Clinton announced an initiative to create a Medicare prescription drug benefit in his State of the Union. This was declaring to the Nation that this was not only a crisis, but it was utmost important. When he delivered his State of the Union address in 1999, he laid out that one of the key goals of the year was creating an affordable prescription drug benefit under the Medicare program. Mr. Speaker, I would say to my friend, the gentleman from New Jersey , we had the opportunity. We had the President. We had two Houses of Congress that should have seen the crisis and the writing on the wall. The gentleman asks the question why? We had legislation, as I recall. I remember we had a partnership with some legislation that was bipartisan as I recall, and that the Democrats and Republicans, at least Members who were on this particular legislative initiative, were prepared to move forward in the Committee on Energy and Commerce. And all of the sudden because of what I shamefully have to admit, that the devil was in the details, we began seeing certain industries feel that their particular stake in this was going to be diminished. What that did to me and if I may selfishly say is have me day after day go back to my district and day after day be asked by my seniors, I thought you were going to pass that Medicare prescription drug benefit. I had town hall meetings. I had national figures in my district. I was speaking to seniors. I was hearing their stories of sadness, plights of individuals, two couples. When I say two couples, a husband and wife, struggling to pay both his drug prescriptions that he needed and hers, two seniors living together, living longer because of Medicare. So the frightening thing about this is we are now in 2002. I have said this before on the floor of the House, we are spending $1 billion a day in the war against terrorism which all of us have united behind the President on that. We had a $5.6 trillion surplus just a year ago and tragically we were hit on September 11. And because we did not have restraint in the administration and proceeded with an enormous tax cut, we have a crisis. But in that crisis, let me say, that I am willing not only to confront the crisis but to take a risk. Let me show my colleague that the American public is prepared to take a risk. A question was raised in a survey, Medicare does not currently pay for prescription drugs and do you think the Federal Government should expand Medicare to pay for part of the drug costs? The survey showed, as my colleague will see, 67 percent of those surveyed believe that we should do that. They are asking the Federal Government to act. Only 6 percent said Medicare should not pay for drugs and only 26 percent of our seniors believe it should be a private system. When they asked would you support or oppose rolling back the tax cut, this is the debate we had here today about this two-thirds super majority on raising taxes, and I will tell anyone I have not announced any position on raising taxes. What I have suggested and what we have suggested, what colleagues in the Democratic Caucus have suggested is a rollback or a moratorium but a recognition that we cannot pay these taxes that give this high percentage of tax cuts to just 1 percent of the American public, but we find here in a survey just recently, March 28 to May 1, 2002, when we asked the American public would you support or oppose rolling back the tax cut that Congress passed last year and using that money to provide a prescription drug benefit under Medicare for seniors, a whopping 64 percent of the American public that are in this survey have indicated that they are willing to do that. Why are they willing to do that? Because they realize that we are coming to a point of no return. We have Medicare that extends the life or has extended the life of our senior population, but we are cutting it off at the door because to extend the life through access to health care, then the prescriptions that have been prescribed must be utilized. We are talking about seniors who have up to 18 drugs that they have to take on average and, therefore, are in need of these resources. Let me just share with my good friend and colleague why I have a problem with what the Republicans are proposing, and I am very glad that the gentleman is yielding.","word.count":1387,"sep11":0.769662921348315,"years":2002.62921348315,"days":2716,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0205926923559911,"Topic 2":0.363417566054399,"Topic 3":0.302892955275302,"Topic 4":0.00944686879696011,"Topic 5":0.133685115616193,"Topic 6":0.00929741114241489,"Topic 7":0.0362142919905033,"Topic 8":0.047410783262457,"Topic 9":0.0680731762013553,"Topic 10":0.00896913930442445},{"id":"10419950026972","body":"David E.

This abuse, which is as criminal as it is un-American, demands full accountability. And full accountability must be demanded not just at the bottom of the military chain of command, but for the highest ranking military and civilian officials who knew or should have known about this behavior and either turned a blind eye to it or failed to immediately address it. Let us be clear. The buck should not and it must not stop with a 20- year-old enlisted man or woman who may well have thought they were acting within the framework of a psychology that permitted them to demean and deny basic decency of treatment to detainees. Mr. Speaker, 43 years ago, I stood in front of this Capitol building as President Kennedy told the American people in one of the most famous inaugural addresses in our history that Americans, he said, are ``unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this Nation has always been committed and to which,'' he said, ``we are committed today at home and around the world.'' Mr. Speaker, I believe we are still committed to those. That is the America that every Member of this body knows and loves; an America that stands for the rights and dignity of every human being; an American America that fights oppression, inhumanity, and intolerance wherever it rears its head. This Congress, the elected representatives of 290 million Americans, must fulfill its constitutional duty as a co-equal branch of government and demand accountability for these criminal acts. This means that we must hold hearings so that the American people and all the world know the truth about this episode. I am pleased to see the chairman of the committee is holding hearings. Some 4 days ago, he said they were not necessary and the leader of his party said they were not necessary. Those who perpetrated these criminal acts and those who created the environment in which such acts were thought to be acceptable should be, must be, held accountable. Today we learn that the Secretary of Defense has known for months that prisoners in Iraq and Afghanistan have been humiliated, beaten, tortured, and even murdered. Twenty-five prisoners have died in U.S. custody. And, still, there is virtually no accountability for those deaths. No House congressional inquiry, no presidential or secretarial condemnation, and no end. The buck must stop somewhere. Private admonishments are not sufficient. Full public accountability must be demanded. If the Secretary of Defense failed to perform his duty, he should be held responsible. If anybody below him failed to perform their responsibility, they too should be held responsible, as should those perpetrators. Mr. Speaker, it is nothing short of tragic that this indefensible conduct threatens to overshadow the extraordinary courage and sacrifice of our brave men and women in our Armed Forces. I have supported their efforts and supported the President in removing Saddam Hussein. We have liberated 25 million Iraqis from the clutches of a ruthless dictator. How proud we are of our men and women in uniform. The only way we can remove that dark cloud that now hangs over their noble efforts is to ensure that those who have acted outside the law are required to answer to it and those who allowed it to go unchecked and unpunished are removed from positions of responsibility. Finally, Mr. Speaker, let me say that the damage inflicted upon our image and standing in the world is incalculable. As Tom Friedman pointed out in the New York Times this morning, it has been quoted before but let me quote it again: ``We are in danger,'' he said, ``of losing something much more important than just the war in Iraq. We are in danger of losing America as an instrument of moral authority and inspiration in the world.'' I will offer a motion to recommit, which makes more clear our outrage and more pointed our demand for full investigation and responsibility. I urge my colleagues to support it. I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.","word.count":717,"sep11":2.71910112359551,"years":2004.57865168539,"days":3410,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.721813953264726,"Topic 2":0.0788925501309345,"Topic 3":0.0194266692905097,"Topic 4":0.0225095579325553,"Topic 5":0.0828096453240044,"Topic 6":0.0136248520738535,"Topic 7":0.00911206360074451,"Topic 8":0.0320756395017045,"Topic 9":0.0106504417609577,"Topic 10":0.00908462712000994},{"id":"11020080062173","body":"Carl Levin: If the Senator would yield, the Rules Committee has jurisdiction over the amendment, over the subject matter of the amendment.

I am hopeful that the progress made on S. 414 would provide momentum to pass the OECD Shipbuilding Trade Agreement implementing legislation. At the end of the last session, we prepared a draft Senate floor manager's amendment to this bill and circulated it within the industry and to members of the Senate. That draft manager's amendment was helpful in moving S. 414 along, but it also continued to present some serious problems to various sectors of the maritime community. Accordingly, over the past several months, representatives of those affected maritime sectors have worked to find an acceptable solution and to resolve their differences. With the Commerce Committee staff's help and guidance, a package of modifications to that original manager's amendment have been agreed upon. The diverse segments of the industry--U.S. ocean carriers, foreign ocean carriers, shippers, labor, and the ports--are now in agreement on how to reform and reduce government's role in international ocean transportation. More importantly, all these industry sectors have agreed on meaningful deregulation of the ocean shipping industry to allow greater choice, flexibility, and competition in this transportation mode. Let me say that again. Mr. President, all these industry sectors are now in agreement. Although it is a delicate balance, it is still an agreement. This agreement will lead to greater efficiency in providing ocean transportation services to U.S. importers and exporters, and will benefit American consumers. U.S. importers and exporters will now, under the reforms of S. 414, be able to enter into more comprehensive and productive contractual relationships with ocean carriers. At the same time, S. 414 provides important protections for ports and labor which will safeguard their interests in a more deregulated environment.","word.count":1342,"sep11":-4.6938202247191,"years":1997.16573033708,"days":771,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.866411329280597,"Topic 2":0.0461731341632768,"Topic 3":0.00916278560721278,"Topic 4":0.0216494668698863,"Topic 5":0.00955607349592349,"Topic 6":0.00951044011418037,"Topic 7":0.00756307150584545,"Topic 8":0.0159870387844517,"Topic 9":0.00991784972722046,"Topic 10":0.00406881045140511},{"id":"10920050004848","body":"John Murtha: Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 609, the College Access and Opportunity Act of 2006. This legislation misses a critical opportunity to provide students from moderate and low income families, access to the American dream. This legislation further depletes our already under-funded Federal student aid programs, placing post-secondary education even further out of reach for the students who need it the most. To be sure, I share the concerns of my colleagues and my constituents, about the rising costs of college and the difficulties of obtaining student aid. However, I am convinced that H.R. 609 fails to adequately address these issues. Mr. Chairman, my concerns with H.R. 609 extend beyond the fact that it squanders an opportunity to enhance America's economic competitiveness, by providing a future generation of highly skilled workers. I have serious concerns about additional provisions contained within the bill. I am terribly concerned about the rising costs of college tuitions across the Nation, and I commend the House Education &amp; Workforce Committee for attempting to address this issue. In fact, I believe that some of the provisions addressing the rising costs of college could aid in addressing this issue. However, I believe that we must tread carefully when setting price controls on college tuitions. It is imperative that we do not infringe upon the independence of our Nation's private and religious institutions. Mr. Chairman, I also am concerned with provisions contained in H.R. 609 that would allow states to function as an accrediting body. If we are going to legislate a deviation from the existing quasi-independent programmatic and institutional accrediting bodies, we must remain cognizant of the potential for major conflicts of interest and the emergence of divisions among public and independent institutions. Politics, demographics, higher education strategies, and economic incentives are among the factors that could contribute to the unintended result of compromising the independence of our nation's private colleges and universities. Mr. Chairman, last month the Republican majority of the House of Representatives voted to raid Federal student aid programs of $12 billion, in the budget reconciliation bill. As you may recall, all of my Democratic colleagues voted against that misguided legislation. Once again I encourage my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, to stand up for the children of America's hard working families and support increased access to higher education for all students.

So for anyone to even opine the thought that a person's rights have been violated simply because there are 40 African-Americans in the U.S. Congress, in a body that consists of 535 people, is absolutely wrong.","word.count":120,"sep11":-6.72191011235955,"years":1995.13764044944,"days":49,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.121669356298182,"Topic 2":0.461881966483924,"Topic 3":0.0627053809830857,"Topic 4":0.00543619655645769,"Topic 5":0.2421322355326,"Topic 6":0.004606759611491,"Topic 7":0.0216549259579046,"Topic 8":0.0167416159142856,"Topic 9":0.0219966792771728,"Topic 10":0.0411748833848966},{"id":"11020070074921","body":"Orrin G.

I think that the Supreme Court must have had too much legal education when they made the decision they made, because we know when our children go on line, when they get on their computers and they see child pornography, we know they can be exploited, we know they can be molested, and we know as parents that it does not make a bit of difference whether it is computer-generated, actual or real. The Supreme Court said this despicable junk can go on; it is not illegal if it is computer-generated. If a prosecutor cannot play the impossible game of picking out an actual, identifiable child, then the molester goes off, he is free to molest, free to continue to abuse our children. If there is anything as a society we ought to do, it is protect our young people. If there is anything we ought to do, it is stop playing legal games with our fine legal educations and start doing what ought to be done, and that is protecting our children from these sexual predators no matter whether they use computer-driven images or actual images.

Mr. Speaker, the last point I would like to make is that since the passage of this amendment I have had the opportunity to visit with the surgeon general of the United States Air Force, and I had some concerns that quite possibly the services, if they were not in favor of this idea, could administratively poison it. I asked him, I said if we can find the money for this will he make it work? I am not smart enough to remember his exact words, but his sentiments were that he was extremely excited about the idea of being compensated for taking care of 65 and older retirees, something that he has been doing basically out of hide. The second thing that he was extremely excited about is the variety of health care cases that his doctors will now be able to see and be compensated for because, as he said, and I will never say it as well as he did, cardiologists do not stay very busy when all they are taking care of is 18- and 19- and 20-year-olds; but in order to have them well trained for mobilization, it is important that some of the older retirees are included in this mix so that those people can hone their skills that they are going to need in the event of a national emergency. So for so many reasons, I think this is a good idea for our Nation. Number one, it is the right thing to do. We are going to keep our promise to those people who kept their promise to us.

As my colleagues have heard, this is a truly bipartisan bill. I commend both sides, as well as Ms. Alvarez, the administrator, and staff because this is something truly, truly remarkable. SBA programs, including its loan and microloan programs, technical assistance services, and small business development centers, have helped our Nation's small businesses grow and prosper. To communities like mine, that are so dependent on small businesses, this assistance is a true lifeline and must be preserved and strengthened. I strongly believe assisting small business makes good business sense. There is a false perception that most people work for large corporations and for big business, but that is just not so. A&amp;G Auto Sounds from east L.A. is a family-opened business that is being assisted in a purchase of a building by the SBA. Let me give my colleagues some clear and convincing reasons why we must support our small businesses. Small businesses have created more than 10 million new jobs in the last 4 years and are a critical component in the implementation of the Welfare to Work initiative. From 1992 to 1996, small businesses, those that are with less than 500 employees, created all of the net new jobs. Nearly 8 million women- owned firms now provide jobs for 18.5 million people, more than are employed in all of the Fortune 500 industrial firms combined. That is quite an achievement. Minority-owned businesses have dramatically increased from 8.8 percent to 12.5 percent of all firms. And Hispanic-owned businesses are now the second fastest growing sector, behind women-owned business. Let us not forget that small business is the vehicle by which millions of our constituents access the American dream. Small businesses create many opportunities for women, for minorities, and for immigrants. Our small business owners work harder and longer. Fifty percent of small business owners work an average of 51 hours a week, as opposed to 34.6 in private industry. And another 26 percent work more than 60 hours a week. These are people with drive, with strong ambition, with new creativity, and with a desire to succeed. They thrive on challenge, and they help make our country the great country it is. We must pay attention to the needs of our small businesses, or we risk losing or at least hampering an important and necessary job creator that has led the way in the last decade to our current economic recovery. We cannot and must not turn our backs on them now. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote for all small businesses by voting for H.R. 3843 and renew our commitment to the Small Business Administration.","word.count":463,"sep11":-1.53089887640449,"years":2000.32865168539,"days":1897,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.584925689331033,"Topic 2":0.325236658957424,"Topic 3":0.00314195080648277,"Topic 4":0.00387883836529205,"Topic 5":0.00563484391227247,"Topic 6":0.0657251917240893,"Topic 7":0.00183467960042997,"Topic 8":0.00307823675889194,"Topic 9":0.00310281413458584,"Topic 10":0.00344109640949891},{"id":"11020080048846","body":"John Cornyn: I thank the Chair I don't blame the American people for being upset at the price of gasoline they have to pay at the pump. Frankly, the biggest cause of those high prices is the Congress. It has been 2 years since Speaker Pelosi said that her party, the Democratic Party, had a commonsense plan to bring down prices at the pump. I am left to wonder how long we will have to wait to hear what that commonsense plan is. So far, all we have heard is an escalation of the blame game, which, of course, here in Washington, DC, inside the beltway, is a world-class sport. The problem with the blame game is it doesn't actually solve any problems. I think what the American people are frustrated about, among other things, is Congress's intransigence, its unresponsiveness, and its unwillingness to listen to their concerns--legitimate concerns--about how they are going to balance their family budget, particularly when it comes to the rising cost of gasoline and the rising cost of health care. As my colleagues can see, in the 2 years that have gone by--in almost 2 years--we have gone from $2.33 for an average price for a gallon of gas to $3.61. That translates for an average family to about a $1,400 increase in expenses a year associated with their gasoline costs-- $1,400 a year. So the Federal Government has essentially imposed an additional tax by its inaction on the average working family in this country. Frankly, we have the tools available to us to remove that tax and remove that burden if we will simply exercise our ability to use those tools in order to begin to bring down that price at the pump. History has shown that raising taxes on oil companies is no solution because ultimately we know who ends up paying for tax increases. Ultimately, they are passed on down to the consumer. So it may be fashionable to beat up on big oil and say: Let's tax the oil companies because they are making too much money, but do you know what. If we raise taxes on the oil companies, we all end up paying an increased price for gasoline at the pump. It also has the effect as we saw from 1980 to 1988; the so-called windfall profits tax actually caused a decline in American oil production, reducing domestic production by as much as 8 percent. So for those who are worried, as I am, about our dependence on imported oil, a windfall profits tax is simply no answer at all. In fact, it is counterproductive. Of course, the problem then was the same as the problem is today, and that is a shortage of oil around the world. I have said it before and I will say it again: Congress can pass a lot of laws, we can repeal some laws, but we cannot repeal the law of supply and demand. Other countries around the world have or want more of what we have in this country, which is unheralded prosperity, primarily because of our use of a disproportionate amount of energy. India and China and growing countries such as those with a billion people each are using more energy, and we are not seeing the supply go up, particularly here at home. So we know that Congress has been one of the biggest obstructions to increasing oil supply and lowering prices at the pump. My staff helped me research these figures to make sure we had justification for them. As we see oil now approaching--maybe it has gone over--$120 a barrel today, if we were to develop the known resources we have available in Alaska that the Senator from Alaska just talked about, it would be the equivalent of $55-a-barrel oil--$120-a- barrel foreign oil versus $55-a-barrel American oil. If we were to develop more of the Outer Continental Shelf in places such as the Gulf of Mexico, even beyond the horizon where you can't even see it from shore, we could produce that oil from American reserves at the price of roughly $63 a barrel--$63-a-barrel American oil versus $120-a-barrel foreign oil. It seems to me we are missing a great opportunity, not only to help bring down the major price driver of gasoline costs--70 percent of the cost of gasoline is the cost of oil--but also to make ourselves more secure and less dependent on foreign sources of oil, enhancing our national security and helping to bolster our economy at the same time. But, as we have heard, Congress has consistently thrown up a roadblock at accessing these sources of American oil. Now, some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have proposed another so-called solution to low supplies. They said: You know what. We are going to take OPEC to court. Let's sue somebody. Unfortunately, that is an all-too-common proposed solution where we are going to litigate, regulate, and increase taxes. But, frankly, it is a little bit--well, more than a little bit--impractical, and it would make us even more hopelessly tied to foreign nations and their production whims. So if your solution is, let's sue OPEC and force them to sell us more oil, does that make us less dependent on foreign sources or more dependent? I would suggest that even if it were practical, which it is not, it would make us more dependent on foreign oil and is not a solution. We need to remember just how much of an impact high energy prices have on the everyday lives of working Americans. High prices drive up the cost of all methods of travel. We are here this week talking about our airlines, and we know what economic pressure has been put on the airline industry and on the prices of tickets that continue to go up because, frankly, the price of oil is coming close to bankrupting the airline industry and driving those costs. But, of course, whether it is the cost of driving the kids to school or driving to work, these high gasoline prices impact everyday Americans all across our great country. As the Senator from Alabama noted, sometimes Congress's best intentions backfire in things such as ethanol subsidies, using corn, using food for fuel, and leading to skyrocketing--helping to lead to skyrocketing food costs, not to mention livestock feed and other unintended consequences. We need to recognize that while developing renewable fuels certainly has its place as a part of the answer, no single solution is a panacea. All of these have to add to our energy diversity and our energy mix in order to provide the relief the American people want and need. Increasing the supply, which will help bring down the cost of oil and the cost of gasoline, as I said earlier, must begin here at home using America's natural resources. Why Congress would mandate, in effect, that we can't buy American, we have to buy foreign when it comes to oil, is beyond me, and it just doesn't make any sense. We can develop environmentally responsible oil production right here at home if Congress would simply act. The only real commonsense near-term solution to bringing down prices at the pump is to take advantage of the enormous natural resources we have right here at home. It is estimated that if Congress stopped penalizing and handcuffing American energy production right here at home, we could produce an additional 2.7 million to 3 million barrels of oil a day. That would be 3 million fewer barrels of oil a day that we would have to buy from Canada, from Venezuela, and from nations in the Middle East. Allowing American production would send a strong message to the American people and to the financial markets that we are working as quickly as possible to drive down gas prices for American families. It would reduce speculation on the commodities markets that is helping to drive up the price of oil because when the financial markets see the Congress doing nothing and see the supply of oil remain static and see the demand increase, it is going to continue to drive prices higher and higher. Unfortunately, we have seen too many Members of Congress block sound energy policies that would give American companies access to our valuable natural resources, such as we have heard about oil deposits in Alaska, offshore deposits, and shale oil sites that the Senator from Alabama mentioned a moment ago. I think most Americans take an instinctive pride in the ``Made in America'' label, and wouldn't it be nice when it came to the gas pump if we saw a ``Made in America'' label on that gas pump. I appreciate the opportunity to talk about what I think is probably the No. 1 issue on the minds of most of my constituents in Texas and most people in America today. It is the reason we had a bunch of truckers here yesterday complaining about the inaction by Congress when it comes to the price of fuel they need to earn a living and move America's goods and services around this country and to our homes. I hope the majority leader and Members of Congress will work together on a bipartisan basis to try to bring some of these policies to the floor as soon as possible and without a moment of unnecessary delay. I yield the floor.","word.count":1570,"sep11":6.80337078651685,"years":2008.66292134831,"days":4864,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0121847662673124,"Topic 2":0.0221486590377742,"Topic 3":0.00391326706170986,"Topic 4":0.00396545656650927,"Topic 5":0.00335703112554975,"Topic 6":0.0267005940156638,"Topic 7":0.00855411580723787,"Topic 8":0.118152349828245,"Topic 9":0.796819351106213,"Topic 10":0.00420440918378432},{"id":"10720010005937","body":"Jane Harman: Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.

Cardoza: Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R 6063, the NASA Authorization Act of 2008. Since the beginning of flight, my home State of Ohio has played a critical role in the aerospace industry. From Wilbur and Orville Wright and the invention of the airplane, to the first American-manned orbital mission by Senator John Glenn, to Neil Armstrong's famous walk on the Moon--Ohioans have been instrumental in maintaining the United States leadership in space. Fifty years after the creation of NASA, Ohio continues to play an important role in the aerospace industry. Ohio's NASA Glenn facility pioneered the use of liquid hydrogen as a rocket fuel--enabling astronauts to reach the Moon. And today, NASA Glenn is working to build cutting-edge vehicles that will one day send a new generation of explorers to the Moon and Mars. NASA's economic impact in Ohio is deep and far-reaching. Today, Ohio's aerospace industry includes 600 companies and employs more than 66,000 Ohioans each year. It is clear that NASA provides significant benefits to the American people. That's why I am proud to support H.R. 6063. It is a fiscally responsible bill that works to ensure that NASA has the resources it needs to successfully conduct a balanced set of missions in human spaceflight, science, and aeronautics. This bill recognizes that NASA is an important contributor to the Nation's innovation agenda and builds on the provisions included in last year's ``America COMPETES Act.'' H.R. 6063 includes provisions that will provide our Nation's next generation of engineers and scientists with the hands-on training and education they need to advance our space program. Madam Chairman, on the 50th anniversary of the U.S. space program and the establishment of NASA, I urge my colleagues in joining with me in supporting this important bill. Mr. CALVERT, Madam Chairman, I commend Subcommittee Chairman Udall, Chairman Gordon and Ranking Members Hall and Feeney and their staff for their work on this bipartisan bill. It is most appropriate that we recommit our Federal support and investment to our Nation's civilian space and aeronautics agency during this 50 anniversary year. NASA has been the Nation's leading catalyst for innovation and technology based on 50 years of broad public support and strong bipartisan political leadership. The agency's work is linked to larger issues like national security, global warming, and American competitiveness. This valuable research is also the genesis of tens of thousands of high-tech jobs in America and millions of dollars into our economy. H.R. 6063 largely follows in the tradition of the NASA Authorization Act of 2005, the first authorization bill to endorse the Vision for Space Exploration which chartered the agency to move beyond low-Earth orbit. I enthusiastically support most measures in this reauthorization including: the reasonable increase in authorization levels which allows the agency to maintain a balanced and robust portfolio of exploration, science and aeronautics activities; the accelerated development of the Orion and Ares launch systems in order to minimize U.S. reliance on Russia for access to the International Space Station; and the full authorization of the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program, as well as the funding to develop a commercial crew capability under this program. I am somewhat concerned about language that may inappropriately tie the administrator's hands by requiring three shuttle flights; two contingency and one for the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, before the fleet's final retirement. I understand why the committee has included the language but I also encourage the Science Committee leadership to work with the NASA administrator to alleviate the outstanding concerns about NASA's ability to properly manage the shuttle fleet and the remaining flight manifest without the mandated flexibility; especially if under unexpected budget and safety constraints. Overall, I am happy to lend my strong support to this reauthorization. I believe it does a comprehensive job of providing NASA the rules and tools to succeed in this Second Space Age. There is not a NASA center in the 44th Congressional District of California, but I understand the criticality of the agency's success and its impact on our Nation's prosperity. I encourage all my colleagues to rediscover the many ways our constituents benefit from the agency's important work. We do not consider this legislation in a vacuum. Other nations are actively pursuing human spaceflight and exploration. China and India are out-producing us in engineering graduates each year many times over. NASA, with its excellent reputation in exploration, science and aeronautics is the one national agency which can focus and inspire America's youth to take up the challenging work of math and science careers. Again, I want to thank the Science Committee leadership and their hard-working staff for their efforts in putting together this bill. I understand it will be important to have a solid civilian space and aeronautics blueprint for the next Administration to follow. I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 6063.","word.count":102,"sep11":5.80337078651685,"years":2007.66292134831,"days":4508,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.925487263104131,"Topic 2":0.0158219323389445,"Topic 3":0.00461531674403764,"Topic 4":0.00887432193105479,"Topic 5":0.0048794385473331,"Topic 6":0.00662818011479841,"Topic 7":0.00225954191504343,"Topic 8":0.0168657529059519,"Topic 9":0.00363640908288725,"Topic 10":0.0109318433158176},{"id":"11020080046266","body":"Wayne Allard: Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Major Perry Jefferson.

After an extensive search, Major Jefferson's body was not recovered and he was subsequently listed Missing in Action. However, in 2001, after 32 years, a Vietnamese national turned over remains that were identified to be that of Major Jefferson. Today, Major Jefferson was finally laid to rest in our nation's most hallowed grounds in a moving ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery. While growing up in Colorado, Major Jefferson developed a love for geology, wilderness and the mines of Colorado; so much so, that his code word was Geneva Creek, after a tributary of the North Fork South Platte River in central Colorado. A graduate of Southern Methodist University, Major Jefferson joined the Colorado Air National Guard as a technician and intelligence officer with the 120th Tactical Fighter Squadron when it was mobilized to Vietnam in 1968.

I first want to thank the chairman and the ranking member for their work to restore cuts in the House bill to the Mission to Planet Earth, the civilian scientific mission to study the environment of this third planet from the Sun. The Senate bill provides $100 million more for NASA than provided in the House bill and restores this critical program for studying global climate change. As the Senate committee report points out, this program also encompasses disaster prediction and mitigation. This element is very important to my State of California. Technological growth and the experience of repeated earthquakes in California have helped expand our ability to provide important data for detailed mapping of earthquake faults. The California Seismic Safety Commission has recommended a research and technology initiative whereby space technology may be used to reduce the risk from major California earthquakes. NASA has the unique ability to provide orbital photography, remote sensing data such as radar, and advanced optics and radio wave technology under the Mission to Planet Earth to assist California's earthquake risk reduction efforts. I understand that Missouri's Office of Emergency Services is interested in this effort, as well. Accelerating California's seismic hazards identification programs would go a long way toward providing earth sciences information in a form that is useful to builders and local government planners so that we can genuinely manage seismic risk and reduce economic damage and human casualties from these natural disasters. I ask the chairman and ranking member if it is their understanding that a portion of the funds provided to the Mission to Planet Earth could be made available for a cooperative program between the Johnson Space Center and the California Seismic Safety Commission and other seismically active States, and if such a program would be consistent with the goals of the Mission to Planet Earth?","word.count":678,"sep11":-6.79494382022472,"years":1995.06460674157,"days":23,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.524061167196271,"Topic 2":0.148763932368957,"Topic 3":0.00656071155260818,"Topic 4":0.0150594349163304,"Topic 5":0.00656966087312166,"Topic 6":0.00825750790646702,"Topic 7":0.0117433155278391,"Topic 8":0.0125595616658603,"Topic 9":0.261650620407274,"Topic 10":0.0047740875852711},{"id":"10619990062900","body":"Mary Landrieu: Mr. President, I use my leader time to make some announcements about the schedule.

My best knowledge of him comes from the trips we have taken to Europe as part of the NATO parliamentary assembly that has been ably led by the gentleman from Nebraska . Herb was a regular on those trips, along with his wife Laura; and he always had a major contribution to make. He was much more diplomatic than I am, because I tend to ask very direct questions and hope for direct answers; but Herb was at his best in dealing with individuals from foreign countries. He would ask those same questions and, hidden underneath the way he asked it, it was still a very direct question; but asked in a very diplomatic and very statesman-like way. In his behavior, in his actions, and particularly in his interaction and questioning with leaders from foreign countries. I will never forget the lessons that I have learned from him. I deeply appreciated Herb in all aspects of his life that I dealt with him. It is with great sorrow that I learned about his demise this past week.

This is the first time in 12 years that a U.S. President has granted such a certification. I am greatly disturbed by this statement. As many Members of this body are aware, China is a major supplier of weapons of mass destruction, nuclear and missile technology. We have less than 30 days to take action and either reject or accept the certification. Mr. Speaker, when the United States and China had signed an accord in 1985 to allow American firms to export nuclear technology to China, Members of Congress were concerned over China's sales of nuclear weapons technology to third countries. In response, Congress quickly passed legislation that required the President to first certify that China has not sold or transferred nuclear technology to countries that are not subject to inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency. In granting this certification, the Clinton administration has chosen to overlook China's recent transfer of nuclear technology to unregulated nuclear facilities in Pakistan and Iran. The administration has accepted a so-called assurance by Beijing that it would cancel or postpone indefinitely several projects, especially secret nuclear facilities in Pakistan and a uranium conversion facility in Iran, as the basis for the United States granting the certification. The administration continues to overlook CIA findings that the Chinese have sold 5,000 ring magnets to Pakistan for its uranium enrichment facility. The ring magnets were transferred to a laboratory in Pakistan, and the facility is named after the founder of Pakistan's nuclear weapons program. I would like to note that ring magnets are used for the building of nuclear weapons. The administration has overlooked, in my opinion, a CIA report that described the Chinese sale of a special industrial furnace and high- tech diagnostic equipment to Pakistan. The furnace and diagnostic equipment have dual use and can be used to melt plutonium as well as uranium for nuclear weapons. Furthermore, by granting the certification the administration is willing to approve China's continued support of Pakistan's commitment to build a plutonium production reactor and a plutonium reprocessing plant. These facilities are essential for a nuclear weapons program. Despite the repeated protests by Members of this body, China continues to assist Pakistan in building a sophisticated nuclear arsenal. Unfortunately, this nuclear arsenal is not subject to international inspection. Furthermore, the administration continues to look the other way as China continues to export technology and ballistic and missile components to Pakistan. I would like to remind my colleagues that Pakistan is not a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency and bans investigators from several of its nuclear facilities. Members of this body have supported and at times insisted that China receive United States peaceful nuclear technology only if China halts all nuclear exports to nations with unregulated nuclear facilities. Last year a letter was sent to President Clinton by Members of this body stating that China has not earned or behaved in a manner that warrants such certification. The Arms Control and Disarmament Agency's annual report to Congress stated that while the administration could not stipulate a violation, questions remained about contacts between Chinese entities and elements associated with Pakistan's nuclear weapons program. Mr. Speaker, I hope that many of my colleagues will support legislation that rejects the administration's granting of this certification. We have less than 30 days to act. We must send a message to the Chinese that we will not turn our heads away and accept its nuclear weapons relations with Pakistan. We should not accept the assurances made by the Chinese when they have continually failed to be responsible and act responsibly as a member of the international proliferation community.","word.count":701,"sep11":-4.71629213483146,"years":1997.14325842697,"days":763,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.113255784541251,"Topic 2":0.0468859685273963,"Topic 3":0.00381893413578764,"Topic 4":0.0568017297274566,"Topic 5":0.595912775346145,"Topic 6":0.00112504047416442,"Topic 7":0.00134016662169043,"Topic 8":0.146374335463386,"Topic 9":0.00152879413753727,"Topic 10":0.0329564710251848},{"id":"10519980007243","body":"Sander Levin: Mr. Speaker, tonight's process is such a sham.

That is not correct. Read the resolution. The resolution has a paragraph that we did not assume either the $250 deductible or the increase in copays for category 7 or 8 veterans. It is not in the budget. I have only said that about three times. Maybe my good friend missed one of my great speeches. Look what we have done. I venture to say that whatever we do is never enough. Mr. President, I say to Senator Byrd, many times he talked to me about mandatories. Mandatory spending on veterans and discretionary are growing under this budget from $61 billion to $71.4 billion. That is a 14.5-percent increase. Not too many categories in this budget will be growing 14.5 percent. I want people to know we are doing a lot. We have assumed a $1.4 billion increase in VA health care. So we have a lot already in this assumption that we are already expanding. I looked at the amendment of my colleague from South Dakota, and where is the increase for outlays for veterans? It is not in this amendment. It assumes maybe there is a trust fund, and if the appropriations bills come in and if they spend a certain amount, then maybe it will be increased and then we will increase the caps. It has a lot of assumptions. The only thing for sure is that it increases taxes. It is very hypothetical, at the most, to say we think that is only going to be on millionaires for a certain amount. That is not what the amendment says. The amendment says increase taxes next year by $5.4 billion over the budget resolution. I also tell my colleagues the taxes that we are assuming for next year will be continued to make sure taxpayers do not have a tax increase are really the marriage penalty relief of $5.4 billion, and the 10-percent tax bracket. That is $4.3 billion for 2005, and the child tax credit is $2.6 billion. That is really what we are assuming. This idea we are going to rewrite the Tax Code is just not going to happen--I think my colleagues know that--not in this election year, not in this environment. What we are assuming are some profamily tax credits. It just so happens veterans are also taxpayers. If we do not do some of these things, a lot of veterans are going to have an increase in their taxes, if they have kids, to the tune of maybe $1,200, $1,600, $2,200, depending on how many kids they have. The marriage penalty alone, if they have taxable income of $58,000, a husband and wife, is $900. The only fact we are sure about in this amendment is we are going to increase taxes and maybe veterans might get some of it if it goes through this process of a reserve fund and then the reserve fund is released and then, depending on appropriations--that is an interesting way to say we are trying to help veterans. This budget tries to help veterans.

Now, when I go back to Minnesota--and when I am in Minnesota I try to be in a school every 2 weeks--here are some of the questions that students might be asking me about this education bill. ``Senator,'' or ``Paul,'' will this legislation reduce the class size or the size of our classes so that our teachers will be able to give us more attention so we won't have to sit on a radiator because there is not enough room in the classroom?'' By the way, I don't speak just for Minnesota but I speak for a lot of schools I visited in this country. My answer will be no, though I would like to be able to say to those students yes, because I know how important class size is to whether or not they receive a good education. ``Senator, will there be any money to renovate our school?'' I was just meeting with a group of students from one of our schools, a middle school in Minnesota, the community of Cambridge. They were talking about some of the problems that they have. ``Senator, will there be any money to rebuild our schools?'' Or as I think about some of the schools I visited around the country, and if I was talking to other children, they might be saying to me, ``Senator, the roofs are caving in, the building is decrepit, the air- conditioning doesn't work during the warm spring months, the heating system doesn't work well during the cold weather months. Is there any money to invest in the infrastructure, because we don't have the wealth in our communities to do this?'' My answer will be, ``No, not in this piece of legislation.'' ``Senator, will this bill train teachers to use technology so they can incorporate that into their teaching--because we are hearing that it is so important for us to be technologically literate to compete in the economy. Will that happen?'' And my answer will be no. How about other people who work with children, people who are down in the trenches? This is their life's work. This is their passion. They say to me, ``Senator, did you in this education bill put any money into early childhood development so that when children reach kindergarten they will be ready to learn?'' And the answer will be no. Then another question will come: ``Senator, what about after-school care?'' I think about the Boxer amendment. ``Did you put any money into good community-based after-school care programs?'' A lot of us with teenage daughters and sons worry a lot about where they are and whether or not there would be something positive for them to do after school. ``Did you all do anything in this legislation to help us?'' And the answer will be no. Then to make matters worse, with some of the amendments that have passed, I heard my colleague from California speaking, now we have block grant amendments that passed. So as a national community, what we used to say was we are a nation. We do not want to grow apart, we want to grow together. We make certain commitments here in the Senate and here in the House of Representatives representing our Nation. We are a national community with certain values and priorities. By golly, one of them is title I. We want to make sure that children who come from families in difficult circumstances--low and moderate income and other problems--get some additional support, and our schools get some additional support so they can give these kids some additional help. Now there is no assurance that will happen. There is no assurance that we will have the same commitment to safe and drug-free schools. We now have with this piece of legislation $1.6 billion or $1.7 billion-- what we have done is not just a money issue. It is not just a lack of investment in crumbling schools. That is not there. It is not just the lack of investment in smaller class sizes. It is not there. It is not the lack of investment in enabling teachers to get more training for uses in technology. It is not there. It is not just a great step backward where we don't invest the money in public education. I don't know what slice of the population we are talking about, but I will tell you there are not a lot of Minnesotans who can just take $2,000 and put it into savings. What about the vast majority of people who don't have those dollars, who are concerned about the communities they live in and the schools their children go to, public education? This isn't a great step forward for public education or education for children; this is a great leap backward. Now we have done something else, I say to my colleagues who supported this initial framework. What we have done through amendments passed on this floor is undercut what has been a historic national community commitment to title I, to children who need that additional help. This is not a step forward; this is a great leap backward. Mr. President, I will tell you, this piece of legislation is a piece of legislation that does not do well for many, many children in our country. We should be able to do much better. If we were to think about the best kinds of things we could do to make sure that children would do well, that we could have good education for all of our children, we would have put a lot of emphasis on smaller class size, and there is no emphasis on it; a lot of emphasis on early childhood development, and there is no emphasis on this; a lot of emphasis on after-school programs, and there is nothing in this legislation; a lot of emphasis on rebuilding crumbling schools. What kind of message do you think these children get when they walk into these dilapidated buildings? The message is that we don't value them. But there is nothing in this legislation that deals with that. Mr. President, what we also would have done is, we would have focused not just on the children, but we should be focusing also on the parent or parents. The two most important explanatory variables in determining how well children do are the income status and the educational status of their parent or parents. We don't put the emphasis on that. We don't put the emphasis on making sure there is health care there and good jobs and family income. We don't put the emphasis on smaller class size. We don't put emphasis on rebuilding crumbling schools. We don't put emphasis on preschool, early childhood development or after-school programs. What we do is undercut and wipe away a major commitment that we have made to the title I program and funds for kids from low- and moderate-income families. This piece of legislation is not a great step forward; it is a great leap backward from a commitment to public education, from a commitment to children and families all across the United States of America, from a national commitment to making sure that we expand opportunities for all of the children in our country. This piece of legislation doesn't do that. It may pass, but it will be vetoed by the President. And I will say to my colleagues that I am sorry, because I guess, with the exception of some Senators who have a different view, this is by and large a difference that we have on the two sides of the aisle. I look forward to this national debate. We will be debating education. In a way, this exercise--I would not call it meaningless. People spoke. But the truth of the matter is that everybody knows the President is going to veto this bill. He has made that clear. In that sense, all of us have felt a little uneasy about this week. But the debate will go on, because this issue of education, this issue of our children, whether our children will get good educational opportunities so they will do well in their lives--this is an important issue to families in North Dakota, Connecticut, Minnesota, and all across the country. As a Democrat, I am telling you, we are going to take this issue out and about the country. We are going to have a discussion, dialog, and debate. This piece of legislation, especially with these amendments, represents a huge step backward, and I want people in the country to understand that on this issue, the differences between the Democrats and Republicans makes a huge difference. I yield the floor.","word.count":1465,"sep11":-3.4747191011236,"years":1998.38483146067,"days":1205,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0324301680531282,"Topic 2":0.0472814160430256,"Topic 3":0.123977481722601,"Topic 4":0.00240433242528877,"Topic 5":0.16846405518961,"Topic 6":0.423702826261807,"Topic 7":0.010359155907061,"Topic 8":0.185949555885023,"Topic 9":0.00298599356677754,"Topic 10":0.00244501494567825},{"id":"10820030000358","body":"David Scott: Mr. Speaker, I want to join our distinguished colleague, the gentleman from California , in paying tribute to Ruth Vreeland.

Once again, we are being asked to vote on a bill that claims to be a solution to a very real problem but which will simply not do the job of lowering premiums. Once again, we are being asked to vote on legislation that ignores the major component in the medical malpractice insurance crisis--insurance. A study of the medical malpractice situation in my State of Illinois found last year that there was little, if any, correlation between medical sea -HMOOsmalpractice payments and medical malpractice premiums. The Americans for Insurance Reform report found that the amount of jury awards and settlements has actually declined since 1991, below the rate of medical inflation. In constant dollars, the amount of medical malpractice jury awards and settlements per doctor has decreased over the past decade in Illinois. As providers in my State know all too well, their medical malpractice premiums are going in the opposite direction. Instead of tracking payouts, they are tracking economic conditions and insurance company investment decisions. Imposing arbitrary caps on non-economic damages-- which would especially limit potential payments to injured infants and senior citizens--is not the answer when the problem is poor investment choices by insurance companies and economic conditions. As a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I had the opportunity to participate in hearings on H.R. 5, last year's medical malpractice bill. We never heard a medical malpractice insurer testify that passage of that bill would lower premiums or that the Federal government should even be allowed to track the effects on medical malpractice premiums if H.R. 5 were to pass. That failure was no surprise given multiple statements made by medical malpractice insurance company officials before State legislatures around the country, that tort reform will not lower rates. Even Sherman Joyce, president of the American Tort Reform Association, has said that ``We wouldn't tell you or anyone that the reason to pass tort reform would be to reduce insurance rates.'' Victor Schwartz, general counsel of ATRA, has said, ``any tort reform advocates do not contend that restricting litigation will lower insurance rates, and ``I've never said that in 30 years.'' Caps won't make medical malpractice premiums affordable but there are other proposals that would make a real difference in providing affordable coverage. As a member of the House Medical Malpractice Crisis Task Force, I had hoped that we would take the opportunity to explore those opportunities instead of being presented with the same bill that we voted on last year, the same bill that the insurance industry itself says won't lower premiums. Here are many ideas that I believe are worthy of consideration but that, unfortunately, are not included in H.R. 4280. We know that insurance reform in California requiring a premium rollback and improving review had a positive impact in lowering medical malpractice premiums--after tort reform did not. We could have created a Commission on Medical Malpractice Insurance to investigate the real causes for premium increases and consider solutions such as mandatory loss-ratio requirements, experience rating, and a Federal reinsurance mechanism. We could have established a certification mechanism to make sure that cases are meritorious, expand Rule 11 sanctions for anyone who falsifies information as part of that process, and encourage arbitration while requiring that savings are passed through by insurers in the form of lower premiums. We could have repealed the McCarran- Ferguson Act that shields medical malpractice insurers from Federal antitrust laws. We could have provided a tax deduction to help health care providers and professionals faced with sharp premium increases. Instead of considering those initiatives, we are being asked to once again pass legislation that restricts the rights of injured patients and their families to seek legal remedies, not just against doctors, but against HMOs and other insurers, nursing homes, medical labs, drug companies, medical device manufacturers and others. For the first time, the Federal government would intrude on what has always been a State authority to take away consumer rights. Yet, the insurance industry itself refuses to say whether doing so will have the effect of lowering rates. It is the wrong answer to a very real problem. In the future, I hope that we will be given the chance to look at ways to address insurances industry practices and reduce the incidences of medial malpractice by improving health care quality. In the meantime, we should reject this bill.","word.count":748,"sep11":2.73595505617978,"years":2004.59550561798,"days":3416,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0118087738154599,"Topic 2":0.321016765697016,"Topic 3":0.056611345477094,"Topic 4":0.00457120873875393,"Topic 5":0.0918776121986431,"Topic 6":0.00399189721876537,"Topic 7":0.00220485014724148,"Topic 8":0.00937097116422861,"Topic 9":0.0596514840768101,"Topic 10":0.438895091465987},{"id":"10619990004860","body":"Jim Turner: Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr. Chairman, let me say that the struggle that is going on in Colombia is going on not only for the sake of drugs but for the sake of an important nation in our hemisphere.

I am concerned that U.S. aid will have little effect if this refugee crisis is not addressed. The common dimension when we are talking about Kosovo or Bosnia or Rwanda or Liberia or so many other places on Earth is one that is shared with Colombia, and that is the extraordinary number of displaced persons who themselves are a destabilizing force within the country that we are trying to stabilize.

As a parent and a legislator, improving our Nation's education system has been a top priority for me. Several years ago, we passed the No Child Left Behind Act to bring accountability to our Nation's learning system. While this bill was a step in the right direction, Minnesota's educators have voiced their concerns over an overly restrictive system that still leaves students behind. The All Students Can Achieve Act will change that by giving flexibility to each State and school without diminishing school accountability. One of the best features of our legislation is that it will allow States to measure individual student growth over time instead of relying on, and teaching for, one test administered on one day. Measuring a student's growth over time benefits both students and teachers because it recognizes that students have different starting points and acknowledges their individual progress. This approach will free teachers from the burden of teaching for one high-stakes test, while still giving parents the assurances they need that their children are learning in a high quality atmosphere. Minnesota has been trying for some time to move to this ``growth model'' of evaluation and our bill provides the funding to develop and implement the data systems our State would need to move to such a model. Our bill also addresses something I have been particularly focused on--ensuring that the next generation has the math, science and foreign language skills needed to be competitive in an increasingly globalized economy. As countries like China or India develop increasingly skilled workforces, we must ensure that American students do not fall behind in these critical and highly relevant fields. Our legislation adds a science assessment to the accountability system and gives States the option to bring in qualified science, math, and foreign language practitioners to assist teachers and students. Another concern I hear in Minnesota is that a school can be, in effect, penalized because a group of new immigrants does not test as well as long-time students. The All Students Can Achieve Act will replace the current all-or-nothing approach with a system that makes a distinction between schools that need comprehensive interventions, versus those that need more focused help. In other words, while current law groups all low performing schools together regardless of how many students miss adequate yearly progress, our legislation offers a more targeted approach, sending additional resources toward schools with pervasive problems, while allowing schools that just have one or more low performing subgroups to focus on closing the achievement gap with that particular group. A final aspect of our legislation is that it would change the way teachers are evaluated. Currently under No Child Left Behind, good teachers have to jump through a number of bureaucratic hoops to demonstrate on paper that they are ``qualified'' experts in the subjects they teach. I understand this has been a serious burden particularly in rural communities, where very good teachers provide instruction in more than one subject. I also know as a parent, that a teacher's resume may or may not reflect their actual abilities in the classroom. That is why our legislation provides States with new flexibility in the ways they rate and reward excellent teachers. At its core, No Child Left Behind is about closing the achievement gap. We still have a long way to go, recent data shows that still only 13 percent of African American and 19 percent of Hispanic 4th graders scored at or above the proficient level on the National Assessment of Educational Progress mathematics test, compared to 47 percent of their white peers. By measuring teacher effectiveness, school quality, and student learning, our legislation will help reduce this unacceptable disparity in America today. Our bipartisan legislation is based on recommendations from a panel of experts, and has been endorsed by some leading educators. However, we know it is just the beginning of a conversation about how and where to add flexibility to the No Child Left Behind law. As we move forward, I welcome the advice of teachers, parents, and administrators on how best to help all students achieve. S. 2002. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to simplify certain provisions applicable to real estate investment trusts, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance. Mr. Hatch: Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007, legislation which would make several important revisions to the current tax law governing real estate investment trusts, or REITs. I am particularly pleased to be joined by my good friend, the distinguished senator from Colorado, Senator Salazar, in sponsoring this bipartisan legislation. I am also very happy that Senators Smith and Kerry are joining us as original cosponsors. The development of real estate investment trusts is among the true success stories of American business. Moreover, REIT legislation enacted over the past 47 years presents a remarkable example of how Congress can create the legal framework to liberate entrepreneurs, small investors, and hard working men and women across the country to do what they do best--create wealth and, more importantly, build thriving communities. When REITs were first created in 1960, small investors had almost no role in commercial real estate ventures. At that time, private partnerships and other groups closed to ordinary investors directed real estate investments, typically using debt, not equity, to finance their ventures. That model not only served small investors poorly, it resulted in the misallocation of capital, and contributed to significant market volatility. Since that time, REITs have permitted small investors to participate in one of our country's greatest generators of wealth, income producing real estate, and REITs have greatly improved real estate markets by promoting transparency, liquidity, and stability. The growth in REITs has been particularly dramatic and beneficial in the past 15 years, as capital markets responded to a series of changes in the tax rules that modernized the original 1960 REIT legislation to adjust it to new realities of the marketplace. I am proud of my role in sponsoring legislation that included many of these changes that modernized the REIT rules, and I remain committed to making every effort to ensure that the people of Utah and across our Nation continue to benefit from a dynamic and innovative REIT sector. I have seen first hand what REITs have done for communities across my State. It is very much in Utah's interests, and in our country's interests, to make sure that REITs continue to work effectively and efficiently to carry out the mission which Congress intended. As my colleagues know, Utah is known as the ``Beehive State'', a testament to the hard work and industriousness of its residents. REITs have proven again and again to be a particularly effective means through which Utahns can utilize those attributes, and aggregate needed capital, to create the thriving real estate sector which is essential to our State's economic well being. Towards that end, I am pleased to report that REITs now account for well over a $1 billion of property in Utah alone, and afford an opportunity for many investors in my State to have an ownership stake in those properties in their communities. This is not an aberration. I believe that my colleagues will find a similarly impressive amount of REIT investment in their home States as well. I am also pleased to report, that, in an era when companies must compete successfully on a global scale, our Nation's REITs have grown to be leaders in international real estate markets, and our REIT laws are proving to be a model for other countries around the globe. In fact, much of the bill I am introducing today is necessitated by the growing international presence of our domestic REITs. The international expansion of real estate investment trusts is something that could not have been contemplated when the first REIT laws were enacted decades ago. The bill we are introducing today is based on S. 4030, which I introduced toward the end of the 109 Congress, and is very similar to H.R. 1147, which was introduced in the House this year. I note that H.R. 1147 enjoys the bipartisan sponsorship of more than two-thirds of the House Ways and Means Committee, and I hope that more of my colleagues on the Finance Committee will join us in supporting this bill. Further, I am grateful that the distinguished Chairman of the Finance Committee stated at our recent markup of the Senate energy tax package that he was aware of my efforts to pass REIT reform legislation this year, and that he and his staff ``will continue to work with Senator Grassley and you, Senator Hatch, to find a tax bill later this year in which to include this proposal.'' I urge my colleagues to review this bill and lend their support to it. In a small but important way, it will help Americans to better invest for their savings and retirement. I hope we can move this straightforward, bipartisan legislation through as quickly as possible. I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section description of the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act be included in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be placed in the Record, as follows: S. 2003.

It will provide them with nonlethal equipment, not counting food aid; but it would give assistance to the people in the south to support their fight against the National Islamic front, which is the government of the north, which has given the people in the south a very, very horrible time over the past 30 years. In Sudan, close to 2 million people have died in war-related causes. Many have died from famine. Many have died from war-related killings. Secondly, in Sudan, slavery is condoned by the al-Bahsir government; and we feel that this is one of the most tragic situations in the world. More people have died in Sudan than in Somalia, Rwanda, Kosovo all put together. We think that this support would help to protect the defenseless citizens to provide them with nonlethal assistance such as medicine, vehicles, field hospitals, communication equipment, radio transmitters so that they can have a way to counter the National Islamic Front's propaganda. The need is even more important now since the Government is using newly found oil revenues to buy arms to destroy the opposition. We cannot allow the extremists to win. We must help create a level playing field if there is going to be meaningful negotiations and a just settlement to the conflict. We must do more to bring about peace in Sudan. We feel that there should be an end to this conflict, and we would like to see the IGAD process led by President Moi of Kenya, who has been working with the government of Khartoum and with the SPLA and with the National Democratic Alliance to try to come up with a solution to end this most horrific situation that is occurring in Sudan. We have seen pictures of slaves that have been purchased from the slave owners. We have seen the beatings of people who have been held in bondage where they are raped or where their Achilles' tendons are cut so that they cannot escape, where they are treated even worse than the animals in the compound where they have to work in indentured servitude. And so, we are saying that the world has too long sat by and has done too little and that we must step up an aggressive movement to assist these people. As I indicated before, an estimated 2 million people have died. They have died of famine. They have died of war-related incidents. There are old Soviet planes that the government in Khartoum uses against the villages in the south, planes called the Antinovs. These planes bring bombs down to the area. And as the plane goes over and as they approach a village, the chickens are the first to hear the planes coming and the children who watch the chickens then start to run. Then the older people know that the planes are coming and it is time to move out. The last bombing, they destroyed a primitive hospital in one of the towns. They have bombed a school that the administrators there have attempted to conduct educational facilities going on. And so this is really something that is the only humane thing to do. We must say that enough is enough. I ask that this amendment be adopted.","word.count":586,"sep11":-1.1938202247191,"years":2000.66573033708,"days":2017,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.351102188483637,"Topic 2":0.133179535851015,"Topic 3":0.0145424977316005,"Topic 4":0.340083700971966,"Topic 5":0.0151508873958391,"Topic 6":0.008808884004939,"Topic 7":0.0110512967047208,"Topic 8":0.0964583655788594,"Topic 9":0.0181200644864919,"Topic 10":0.0115025787909321},{"id":"10920050080261","body":"Tom Harkin: Further reserving the right to object, and I will object, with all due deference to my friend from Kansas, and he is my friend, these two need to be together as they were in the House.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 314, legislation recognizing the members of the AMVETS for their service to the Nation, and supporting the goals of AMVETS National Charter Day. I want to especially recognize and thank the prime sponsor of the legislation, the gentleman from New York , for his fine work on this legislation, and for his very strong support of the many veterans bills that we have moved in this Congress. From its origin in the middle of the World War II, Mr. Speaker, AMVETS has had a long and distinguished history of service to our Nation. They held their first national convention in Chicago in October of 1945; and just 2 years later, on July 23, 1947, President Harry Truman signed the AMVETS charter. Originally organized for World War II veterans, AMVETS had their charter amended in 1966 to include veterans who served honorably during the Korean conflict and the Vietnam War and, again, in 1984 to include those who served honorably during peacetime as well. From its humble origins, AMVETS has grown into a national organization with over 250,000 members, in addition to another 60,000 members of their ladies' auxiliary. As chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I can attest to the important role that AMVETS plays in Washington in advocating stronger Federal policies for supporting veterans, their surviving spouses and dependents as well. Their legislative staff is among the finest, and they have played a key role in many important public policy debates. I know I can count on AMVETS for advice, counsel, and support as we continue developing national policies to benefit our veterans. Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize and commend their national commander, Joseph Lipowski. He should be proud of the success AMVETS has achieved and continues to achieve, not just in Washington but also in communities across America. In addition to providing benefits and services to their fellow veterans, they also play an important role in the civic life of their communities.

There has not been a single hearing on this bill. There have been no witnesses called to testify in support of this bill. There have been no witnesses who have had an opportunity to stand before a committee and oppose this bill. That is no way to legislate. Yet we are going to pass one of the most far-reaching pieces of legislation that we have passed in my 50 years in Congress. It will provide for a massive shift of power. To whom? To the President of the United States. If he were a Democrat, I would oppose this just as vociferously, just as strongly, just as bitterly as I oppose this piece of legislation right here. I don't oppose it because we have a Republican President. I am going to oppose it because it gives away the powers of the people. It provides for a massive shift of power to the executive branch. It upsets that delicate balance of power the Framers provided to the American people over 200 years ago. The popularity of a President is a fleeting thing, a fleeting thing. Our duty to our Nation is not. One serious problem with the legislation before the Senate is the expanded authority it gives to the executive branch to conduct its actions in secret. Here is where I hope the press, the fourth estate, will pay close attention. I have great respect for a free press. I have not always been happy with what the free press has written about me, but in my 50 years, I think overall the press has been very fair to me. I have no complaints. Some of the things the press has said that I didn't like I deserved. I am for a free press. One serious problem with the legislation currently before the Senate is the expanded authority that this legislation gives to the executive branch to conduct its actions in secret, protected from the oversight, protected from the scrutiny of the Congress, the media, and the American people. An example of this expanded secrecy that has been added in this new bill can be found in the exemptions that it provides from the Federal Advisory Committee Act. This is section 871 of the new substitute that we have just been given, the substitute that fell like manna from heaven. But this didn't come from heaven, I can assure you. It fell into our laps about 48 hours ago without any warning, and we are asked to invoke cloture on this thing tomorrow. Let me say that again. An example of this expanded secrecy that has been added in this new bill can be found in the exemptions it provides from the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Section 871 of this new substitute we have just been given provides the Secretary of Homeland Security blanket authority--get that, blanket authority--to exempt all advisory committees in the Department from existing public disclosure rules. That is pretty serious. This provision was not included in Senator Lieberman's substitute, but it has been slipped into this new bill which was made available to us, as I said, late Tuesday night of this week. I am told it was 5 in the morning. It appeared on the web site of the House Rules Committee, I believe, the night before, Tuesday night. It was made available to us just within these last 48 hours with the hope that Senators will not have enough time to scrutinize this dramatic change to an existing statute. The statute I am talking about here, the Federal Advisory Committee Act, applies to the ad hoc committees that are often used in the executive branch to formulate policy. This statute, the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which has been on the books for 30 years now, requires the advice provided by these advisory committees is objective and accessible to the public. The purpose of making this information available to the public is to allow the Congress, the media, and groups outside of Government to know how the executive branch is making important policy decisions. The role of this oversight and scrutiny from the public and a free press is central to upholding the principles of our government, of our constitutional system. It ensures that the people--the people--will be the ultimate judges of the wisdom of the policies of the Federal Government. I understand this new Homeland Security Department will be wrestling with many issues of national security that should not be subjected to public disclosure rules. Sometimes these advisory committees will be dealing with classified intelligence information or with sensitive security policy, and making this information available to the public might compromise national security and the fight against terrorism. I understand that. But that is exactly why existing law allows the President of the United States, be he a Democrat or a Republican, to waive these public disclosure rules for any advisory committee for national security reasons. The President can do that on a case-by-case basis in the current law. So the President has this authority today. He will have it tomorrow. And he will be able to use it to protect any advisory committee in the Homeland Security Department from having to disclose information when national security information is involved. But he will be accountable for that. He will be responsible for that. So why do we see an expansion of this authority given to the Secretary in this bill? Why do we see an expansion of this authority given to the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security in this bill? Advisory committees can already be exempted from public disclosure rules for national security reasons by the President on a case-by-case basis. So why does this bill, then, allow the Secretary of Homeland Security to exempt any committee, regardless of whether national security is pertinent? Why is it in there? Why do we see this new blanket authority in this bill? I will tell you why. It is because this administration wants to shield itself from any scrutiny of the public. This administration has made it very clear that it does not want anyone meddling in executive branch decisions--not the Congress, not the media, not the American public. Since the first day this administration took office, all we have seen is a concerted effort to prevent outside criticism of its policies and conduct. The White House has refused to share information or cooperate with the Congress at every turn--maybe not at every turn, but at all too many turns. The Vice President has refused to release documents concerning a secret energy working group, even after court orders demanding that he do so. We have read in the newspapers that the Attorney General is trying to expand the powers of the Justice Department to operate in secret, appealing another court decision that rejected his new secrecy rule. Even Tom Ridge, the President's top man in the war on terrorism, refused to testify before Congress about the steps that the administration was taking to protect the American people. With the President's support, top officials in this administration have stonewalled Congress--stonewalled the Congress. Tom Ridge stonewalled the Appropriations Committee of the U.S. Senate. I know; I am the chairman of that committee. Invitation after invitation was extended by my colleague, Senator Stevens, and myself for him to appear before the Appropriations Committee to testify. The answer was no. With the President's support, top officials in the administration have stonewalled Congress, stonewalled the media, and they have stonewalled the American public. Now they are hoping to expand their ability to operate in secret, to allow even less public scrutiny. There it is. It is in the bill. The provisions in the bill allow the Secretary to use ad hoc advisory committees to craft policy in secret, without making specific findings that such secrecy is necessary in any particular instance. This unnecessary new blanket authority will give the President carte blanche to expand the culture of secrecy that now permeates this White House. This substitute language that we have just been given also provides the same blanket exemption from disclosure rules for the Justice Department's new Office of Science and Technology. This new exemption will allow John Ashcroft, the Attorney General, to conduct even more of his duties in secret, even after the courts and the press have recently rebuked the Justice Department for secrecy abuses. This Senate is being asked to authorize the Attorney General to cloak even more of the Justice Department's activities in secrecy. I am worried that exempting this new Science and Technology Office will allow the Justice Department to provide special treatment for corporate campaign contributors who are pushing new technologies. Let me say that again. I am worried that exempting this new Science and Technology Office will allow the Justice Department to provide special treatment for corporate campaign contributors who are pushing new technologies. These exemptions are unnecessary and they are a danger to our people's liberty. I believe that I have a duty to the people I represent to do what I can to improve this legislation. So I hope to offer an amendment to strike these exemptions from the bill. I will do whatever I can do to improve the legislation and keep the people and the press from being locked out of the process. The people have a right to know. I am not among those who are willing to let this Senate be beaten into rubber stamping the language sent to us by the House. It is our job as legislators to see that the Senate protects the interests of the people who sent us here and who will foot the bill for this behemoth department. The public disclosure exemptions in this bill are a license for abuse. I do not believe that they are worthy of the Senate's approval. So I am doing everything I can to see that this Senate does not roll over at the command of any President--whether he is a Democrat or a Republican or an Independent-","word.count":7885,"sep11":1.20505617977528,"years":2003.06460674157,"days":2871,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0102474611557458,"Topic 2":0.110635991890646,"Topic 3":0.0086357017955048,"Topic 4":0.00319891577764144,"Topic 5":0.768896026076734,"Topic 6":0.00235847618331482,"Topic 7":0.00201770823904531,"Topic 8":0.0174093906787509,"Topic 9":0.00364118639086383,"Topic 10":0.0729591418117532},{"id":"10920060010598","body":"Steve King: Mr. Chairman, I wish to take time to highlight a watershed-related project at Storm Lake, IA, in my district. As background, Storm Lake's depth and water quality have been deteriorating since the last dredging in the early 1960s. Storm Lake is among 156 water bodies to make the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencies list of ``imperiled'' streams and lakes because of siltation. Removing silt and radically improving water quality will prevent massive fish kills. Storm Lake is well known for being a conducive environment to Walleye breeding. The Department of Natural Resources has come to depend on this Walleye population to assist in feeding other lakes and tributaries within the State of Iowa. The Storm Lake community has implemented practices by both business and residents in an effort to ensure that the current dredging of Storm Lake will last for several generations to come. Finally, local agricultural land owners on or near the Storm Lake watershed have incorporated farming practices that help curb or reduce the amount of runoff into the Storm Lake Watershed. I believe this comprehensive approach to water resource management by the Storm Lake community is to be commended. Funds will be used to dredge 700,000 cubic yards of spoil from the lake. Through decades of ground erosion and silt freely entering Storm Lake the lake levels have diminished. In order to remove the silt and prevent the continued inflow of silt, a Lake Restoration Program was needed to dredge a large portion of the lake and to develop watershed protection practices. Therefore the Iowa Department of Natural Resources believes this dredging and watershed work plays a vital role in the water quality and restoration of the lake. Buena Vista County, the city of Storm Lake, and the city of Lakeside view the dredging project as an essential component in the overall economic development of the area. Dredging will create positive environmental effects while increasing the natural habitat for native fish and marine organisms.

Quickly, in response to one of my earlier colleagues, I have drawn a conclusion that this bill represents the best of the Quincy Library bill. The Quincy Library bill brought this House together in understanding the difficulties of managing the Nation's forests, and we passed that bill. I think this bill does the same thing. Very quickly, I would like us to look at the big picture here. This country was founded on four very positive things: democracy, character, an endless frontier, and an abundance of natural resources. Well, our resources are diminishing quickly. Our frontier is gone. Basically what we have left to manage our resources for future generations, yes, hundreds of years in the future, is democracy and character. We have to rely on democracy and character. What is the next frontier? It is an intellectual frontier. An intellectual frontier means we have to put aside rancorous debate, personal prejudices, sit together and discuss these issues in as intelligent a manner as is possible so that we can manage those few remaining resources for generations to come. Can we sustain logging, mimic nature and protect biological diversity? Yes, we can. Do we have the knowhow? Yes, we do. How do we implement that knowhow? The first step to implementing that particular skill is through this bill. Is this bill based on the best available scientific data? Absolutely without question. Does this bill protect all environmental regulations? Absolutely without question. What are some of the things this bill does? It goes in and finds those areas of the riparian places in our national forests that are damaged, and we will fix them. Soil stabilization, water quality improvements, thinning, habitat improvement, et cetera, et cetera et cetera; this bill does that. The chief of the Forest Service said 35 to 40 million acres are in danger of catastrophic fire, soil erosion, habitat loss. So what do we do? Do we come up to the plate and respond? The answer is yes. This is not about forest roads, it is not about commercial logging, it is not about clear-cutting. This is about funding a recovery program for our Nation's forests. Is this bill more positive than negative? That is the question. More than we can ever know at this point, this bill is positive, and I urge my colleagues to vote yes.","word.count":423,"sep11":-3.55056179775281,"years":1998.30898876404,"days":1178,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0573486168858452,"Topic 2":0.284511653536676,"Topic 3":0.0493103318773712,"Topic 4":0.00700762792269986,"Topic 5":0.318278174992509,"Topic 6":0.025786018784684,"Topic 7":0.0122276680101713,"Topic 8":0.173470506563611,"Topic 9":0.0141648939019165,"Topic 10":0.0578945075245156},{"id":"10620000080238","body":"Ted Stevens: Mr. President, I am grateful to my friend from New Mexico. I am here once again to talk about the last controversial amendment in the appropriations bills for the fiscal year 2001. We have completed all work on these bills now except for one amendment and that is the amendment that pertains to the Steller sea lions. I am here because there seems to still be a misunderstanding about what we are trying to do. The Congress has passed and the President has signed, as a matter of fact, an extension of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the act that deals with the 200-mile limit off our shores. That act in its original form created the North Pacific Fisheries Council that has jurisdiction under the law for the management plans that apply to fisheries off the shores of my State of Alaska. In its recent action in issuing a biological opinion under the Endangered Species Act, the Department of Commerce saw fit to use the emergency portions of the Magnuson Act to issue a management plan for pollack and for cod off the State of Alaska within what they call the RPAs, the reasonable prudent alternative areas, dealing with the decline of the Steller sea lion. There is no emergency provision in the Endangered Species Act. Under the Magnuson Act, management plans are issued by the regional councils, not by the Department of Commerce. There is an emergency clause, if the Secretary makes findings of problems with the fishery, that could justify the Secretary issuing a plan or a revision of the existing plan. That was not done. Instead, the Department of Commerce saw fit to use the emergency clause of the Magnuson Act to once again seize total control of the pollack and the cod fisheries off our shores within the so-called RPAs. They amount to an area of 20 miles around every sea lion rookery. It is an area that extends from Kodiak, all the way out along the Aleutian chain. The National Marine Fisheries Service has told us there is no data to support the concept that there is a connection between the decline of the sea lion and the harvest of pollack. There is no cause and effect relationship scientifically that exists with regard to this decline. We are appalled by the decline of sea lions off our shores. We also know that sea otters are steadily disappearing, as are fur seals and harbor seals. We believe the reason is the tremendous increase in the killer whales. That is another subject. Very clearly, what the Department has done now is to increase the danger for fishermen who live in Alaska and fish in the areas off our shores. That fishing currently has the highest level of deaths per capita of any industry in the United States. What this order has done, now, is it has foreclosed the fishing by these small boats in the areas where the pollack is located except during the wintertime. This is a particularly dangerous area. Winter storms increase the problems of fishing. What is more, if they follow the order and go beyond the 20 miles, the further from shore they go on these small boats, even a minor injury becomes a life threatening injury, particularly in the stormy season. I have to report to the Senate that the Coast Guard voted against following this biological opinion last Saturday, in my State, for safety reasons. What the administration has done is they have restarted the race for the fish. They have made it almost impossible for the enforcement of this biological opinion. They have not consulted with the people who really know the industry as they have issued this opinion. This opinion will have a $500 million to $800 million impact on the industry, according to figures that came from the Department itself. Just think of this. The largest concentration of fish processors in the United States is on Kodiak Island. I was informed yesterday that, as a result of this opinion, if it is enforced, Kodiak processors will be able to operate for 2\\1/2\\ days. This opinion will create ghost towns in my State along the shore from Kodiak all the way out along the Aleutian chain. Primarily those are native villages. These are not enormous factory trawlers. They fish way offshore. These are people who live in these small villages and harvest this fish--which is a unique fish, as I have told the Senate before. It is unique because it is a biomass constantly growing. Because of the management schemes we have worked out under the Magnuson Act, that biomass has increased almost five times since we started the Magnuson Act. There is more pollack than ever before, but this is going to limit fishing for pollack in specific areas where the small boats fish. There is just no way to justify this. Native Alaskans, as I say, are going to lose their jobs, lose their subsistence. About 1,000 boats that otherwise would have gone to sea will not fish under this order. It is just unconscionable. I am not one who makes threats; I make statements. I have made the statement that I will not sign this conference report if it does not adequately restore this fishery. I will oppose the bill on the floor, and I am hopeful my friends on this floor will understand why. What this means is we cannot resolve this issue. My staff will meet-- thanks to the good offices of the Democratic leader--with representatives of the administration in just a few minutes, but if we cannot resolve this, my advice is make different reservations. Understand, I cannot as a Senator allow an action that is not following the law that I helped author put a considerable portion of the people who have year-round jobs in my State out of work, and not just temporarily. They have purported to create these areas around these rookeries forever without any consultation with the regional council that was created by the Magnuson Act, without any public hearings, based solely upon a lawsuit that was filed in a Federal court in Seattle and a friendly suit to use that as a justification for taking back into the Federal Government the management of these two magnificent fisheries-- pollack and cod--off our State. In my opinion, it is unconstitutional, but I know one thing--it is not going to be approved by this Senate. I thank the Chair, and I thank my friend from New Mexico.","word.count":1084,"sep11":-0.76123595505618,"years":2001.09831460674,"days":2171,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.403366877507772,"Topic 2":0.10464262504864,"Topic 3":0.135167943522723,"Topic 4":0.014338176496879,"Topic 5":0.112094072979688,"Topic 6":0.0965856026503553,"Topic 7":0.0279644803911301,"Topic 8":0.0452505150562785,"Topic 9":0.0531129185738073,"Topic 10":0.00747678777272741},{"id":"10920060064531","body":"Russell Feingold: Briefly, the letter notes that there are still flaws that remain in S. 3709, and urges the Senate to adopt at least four measures to address them. The second of their four recommendations for improvements is that there be ``a determination and annual certification that U.S. civil nuclear policy does not in any way assist or encourage India's nuclear weapons program.'' My amendment is directly in line with the advice of these leading experts, and addresses an important shortfall in the legislation as it stands now. I acknowledge that the U.S. business community has come out strongly in support of this legislation. I would only like to add a note of caution to their optimism. There is nothing in this deal that would secure U.S. contracts or guarantee an increase in U.S. business. The U.S. is not the only one in the nuclear market. Australia and Russia have already indicated they are working with India to sell fuel, and companies from Great Britain, France, and Russia have viable civil reactor technology that they will certainly pitch to India. It is far from a foregone conclusion that U.S. companies will directly benefit from the deal. In the 8 years that nuclear trade has been permitted with China, the United States has sold exactly zero nuclear reactors to China--zero. I bring this up to point out that some of the benefits of this deal may be exaggerated, and we should remember the overriding priority as we consider this legislation: whether it will make the citizens of the United States more safe, or less. Mr. President, in closing, I would like to put in a brief word of appreciation for the substantial amount of work done on this bill by Senator Lugar, Senator Biden, and their staffs. This bill is a real improvement over the original proposal put forward by the administration, but there are still a few shortcomings that remain. My amendment would address what I, and many others, see as one of the main outstanding concerns with the bill. It will ensure that this agreement is in line with our non-proliferation obligations and protects U.S. national security, without putting any undue burdens on the U.S. or our Indian partners.

Recently one of the polling companies from here in Washington, D.C., asked 2,000 American adults, ``Do you think the United States Government should increase faster that the rate of inflation, faster than the family budget; at the same rate as the family budget; or slower than the family budget?'' It was a 90-to-3 answer. Ninety percent of Americans believe that the United States Government should not increase faster than the family budget or faster than the rate of inflation. So we decided we were going to put together a proposal that met the wishes and the demands of the American people. This black line on this chart that I have here shows inflation. That is how fast the family budgets are going up across America. The farthest column, that shows how fast the CAT's budget is increasing spending out here in the government. And I would point out that it is the only proposal that we are considering, the President's, the Senate, the House, the Democrat alternative, it is the only proposal that we are considering out here today that allows government spending to go up at a slower rate than the rate of inflation. Mr. Chairman, 90 percent of the American people believe that the Federal Government should not increase its spending faster than the family budget, and this is the only opportunity we have today to keep that and to meet that wish. The House budget, the Kasich budget, if we take Social Security out of the picture, it also meets that. With Social Security in the picture, it goes up slightly faster than the rate of inflation but it is the second closest to meeting the wishes of the American people. I have heard a lot of rhetoric about preserving Social Security. Baloney. The only budget out here that puts more money aside for Social Security is the budget we are about to vote on. The CAT's budget puts $275 billion aside to preserve and protect Social Security. I believe every senior citizen in the United States of America has a right to get up tomorrow morning knowing that their Social Security is safe and secure. So in the CAT's budget we put more money aside for Social Security than any other budget being considered. So let us cut through the rhetoric out here and let us get down to the facts of what is actually being considered. The CAT's budget puts aside $275 billion for Social Security; the House budget, $223 billion; the Senate proposal, $149 billion; and the President's proposal just under $100 billion. So if Members are serious about preserving Social Security for our senior citizens in this country, the CAT's budget is the right vote. What about the tax burden on American workers? The tax burden is too high. A generation ago 25 cents out of every dollar that workers earned went to taxes. Today that number is 37 cents out of every dollar they earned. Let us translate that into what it means. It means that American workers have to take second and third jobs in order to pay that extra tax burden from this government. That is wrong. That is why the CAT's budget proposes $150 billion in additional tax reductions. Eliminate the marriage tax penalty. Across-the-board tax cuts. And, shoot, the inheritance tax, we have already paid taxes on it once. I believe every American in this country after working hard should have the opportunity to pass their inheritance on to their children, not to the United States Government. That is why we have proposed extensive tax relief. How are we able to set aside for money for Social Security and provide additional tax relief? That really goes back to the first chart, and again this first chart shows it emphatically. This is the only budget that holds spending increases in this government at or below the rate of inflation. These others that are going up faster than the rate of inflation will say good-bye to the tax cuts, will say good- bye to that money is that supposed to be set aside for Social Security, because every nickel over the rate of inflation, that is money that should be set aside to preserve and protect Social Security and reduce the tax burden on our American families. Let me close with what I believe the priorities of this Nation are, because we have been hearing about these priorities and where we place our priorities in this country. I believe our priorities should be to defend our Nation. I believe it is the number one role of this government, to make sure that this Nation is safe and secure for our children. I think our responsibility is to return the control of education back to the parents and the teachers and the community. Control of education should not be out here at the United States Government. And just for the record, this budget allows inflationary increases in education. Preserve Social Security and reduce the tax burden. Those are the priorities of the CAT's budget.","word.count":856,"sep11":-3.35393258426966,"years":1998.50561797753,"days":1248,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.520646313246059,"Topic 2":0.318006224263465,"Topic 3":0.00752291902198474,"Topic 4":0.0159549713144815,"Topic 5":0.00935624524511829,"Topic 6":0.0616613313317943,"Topic 7":0.0050571964829368,"Topic 8":0.0104528641432166,"Topic 9":0.00927835860324285,"Topic 10":0.0420635763477013},{"id":"10720020042980","body":"Donald Nickles: Well, I am not a big fan of tax credits, just so the Senator from Maryland knows--and the Senator from West Virginia already knows this about the Senator from Oklahoma.

But I represent Florida, and I represent the coast that we consider a valuable resource for tourism, the environment, the ecology. Let me remind my colleagues the area that they are proposing to drill both oil and natural gas wells has recently been referred to as Hurricane Alley. The gulf coast, we all know now, after Katrina, is responsible for 25 percent of U.S. production of natural gas. Following Katrina and Rita, almost 75 percent of the natural gas production in the gulf was shut down and not producing. As of May 3, almost 13 percent of natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico was still offline 9 months later. So it begs the question, why would you put more rigs in a vulnerable place? Now, I understand some States like drilling, like oil and like offshore rigs. And my question, or my statement, to you is, have at it. But I do want to have the opportunity as a Floridian to defend ourselves from having oil drilling rigs off our coastline. Several Governors are opposed to the provisions, including Governor Schwarzenegger; my own Governor Bush who sent a letter to the Speaker just yesterday; Governor Mark Sanford, our former colleague from South Carolina; Democrat Governor Corzine of New Jersey; Mike Easley of North Carolina; and Ted Kulongoski of Oregon. Our delegation remains strongly opposed to drilling for oil and gas in this very, very vulnerable area. Let me tell you the infrastructure problems suffered by our recent hurricanes. A Congressional Budget Office study estimated that gulf energy infrastructure repair costs will be between $18 billion and $31 billion, just from the damages the hurricane created. So let's build some more rigs in this very vulnerable area. I mentioned the responsibility of natural gas. The gulf has 30 percent of U.S. crude oil production, again another reason we do not want to endanger our coastline. Again, 9 months later, almost 22 percent remain offline. So I urge defeat of this amendment, removal of the Peterson amendment from this appropriation bill, and let us do something right and not simply succumb to the politics of convenience on energy prices.","word.count":223,"sep11":3.75561797752809,"years":2005.61516853933,"days":3779,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0184852247660847,"Topic 2":0.295965149705186,"Topic 3":0.304509117440727,"Topic 4":0.0131436867391961,"Topic 5":0.0206429286551728,"Topic 6":0.0110983696675395,"Topic 7":0.007084220481402,"Topic 8":0.0167604658757606,"Topic 9":0.0113253818316172,"Topic 10":0.300985454837314},{"id":"10620000032834","body":"Jim Gibbons: Mr. Speaker, this Republican Congress is working hard to pass legislation that meets the needs of Americans, such as providing prescription drug coverage, protecting the Medicare and Social Security trust funds, and paying down the national debt.

Dennis Hastert: Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R 2779, the Savings in Construction Act. I'd like to thank our distinguished chairs, Mrs. Morella and Mr. Walker, as well as Ranking Member Brown for moving this bill quickly through the Science Committee. Most of all, I'd like to thank my good friend, the chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, Mr. Cox, for all his hard work on this legislation. When the gentleman from California learned about the thousands of American jobs that could be lost, and the millions of tax dollars that would be wasted pursuing a hard metric standard, he responded by crafting this commonsense, bipartisan piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, as part of the Metric Conversion Act of 1975, the Congress required each Federal agency to ``use the metric system of measurement in its procurements, grants, and other business related activities'' but with the important exception of not mandating its use when ``such use is impractical or is likely to cause significant inefficiencies or loss of markets to United States firms.'' Thus, under this law, it seems clear that Federal agencies should seek to use a soft metric standard--for example, requiring that building materials be measured in metric units. This is certainly a reasonable policy. However, a number of Federal agencies have exceeded the intent of the Metric Conversion Act and are now seeking to apply a universal hard metric standard to purchases of certain construction materials by the Federal Government. A hard metric standard stipulates that not only must materials be measured in the metric system, but that they must also be manufactured in round metric dimensions. In many cases, this would require plants manufacturing construction materials to completely retool their production facilities, and rework their product line to produce a product with slightly different dimensions. This expensive process would satisfy only the needs and desires of a few Government bureaucrats, not the demands of the free market. Since Federal contracts account for only about 5 percent of the construction industry, only the biggest firms will go to the expense of retooling. This would effectively eliminate hundreds of American small businesses from competition for Federal contracts. The exclusion of these small businesses from the market will result in less competition, fewer bids on contracts, and greater costs to the American taxpayer. What's worse, in seeking to apply a hard metric standard, some Federal agencies are ignoring the direct warning of the Metric Act not to do so in cases where it would be impractical, inefficient, or result in a potential loss of markets. Mr. Speaker, through the corrections process, H.R. 2779 addresses this problem by taking the existing metric law and giving it teeth. It requires the Government to use common sense in its purchasing decisions, and allows the free market to play a bigger role. It will prevent Federal bureaucrats from arbitrarily imposing a hard metric requirement for Federal contracts on key industries providing construction materials for Federal construction projects. It also creates the position of metric ombudsman, who will make decisions regarding future metric implementation using some basis commonsense standards: the availability of hard metric products, the impact on American jobs, the competitiveness of American firms, and the cost to the United States taxpayer. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this commonsense legislation. By passing H.R. 2779, Congress can act to enhance the competitiveness of American industry, protect small businesses, save thousands of union jobs from foreign competition, and save the American taxpayer money. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill. I yield back the balance of my time.","word.count":606,"sep11":-5.26966292134831,"years":1996.58988764045,"days":566,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.323358502736277,"Topic 2":0.110746303185734,"Topic 3":0.00896990708957151,"Topic 4":0.0242390428888944,"Topic 5":0.00546640490988221,"Topic 6":0.0589808488489869,"Topic 7":0.230959340936942,"Topic 8":0.0125384638872236,"Topic 9":0.221687929387416,"Topic 10":0.00305325612907247},{"id":"10519980053819","body":"Pete Domenici: The Senator is correct.

Secure and accurate information is the lifeblood of effective government. There has been a wide range of incidents involving data loss, theft, privacy breaches. But more troubling is that some seek to tamper with or corrupt the official records of this Nation, to rewrite history, if you will. Our goal here is to protect the integrity of the public record. Under this motion the Archivist of the United States shall prescribe internal procedures to prevent unauthorized removal of classified records from the National Archives and Records Administration or the destruction or damage of such records, including when such records are accessed or searched electronically. First, we set forth a number of procedures to ensure these records remain secure. Second, we close a loophole in the Presidential Records Act that allows those previously convicted of unauthorized removal of classified materials back into the archives where they could do more damage. If a person has demonstrated propensity to commit crimes relating to the removal and destruction of classified Federal records, we should take the simple step of blocking their access in the future. The professionals at the National Archives are serious-minded historians and are not well suited to the role of police officer or security guard. The motion states that the archives shall not make available any original Presidential records to any person convicted of a crime involving the review, retention, removal, or destruction of archives records. This prohibition extends to individuals with special designations by former Presidents. In short, if you're convicted of mishandling classified materials, we want to remove you from the pool of people coming to the archives. You're a risk, and we are obligated to mitigate risks of this type. I would like to note that this second provision passed the House in identical form over a year ago as part of H.R. 1255, the Presidential Records Act, which still has not been enacted into law, by a vote of 333-93.

This bill is not needed to address real problems of forest health. The Forest Service has now authority to take actions that are needed, such things as prescribed burns, thinning, et cetera, where the health of the forest requires it and where there is a risk of wildfire. The bill would establish a new, cumbersome, bureaucratic administrative process that is not needed. The Forest Service financing methods and accounting systems have long been a subject of criticism. Yesterday, a joint hearing looked into those issues. What we found was that there were problems, but the Forest Service is cleaning up that mess. This bill would impede that process and make matters worse. First, it would divert money from a road and trail maintenance fund at a time when the service has a huge maintenance backlog, $10\\1/2\\ billion, and put it into a new recovery trust fund not subject to appropriations. The fact that that is not subject to appropriations should set off a warning bell for every Member of this House. How will that money be used? Who will scrutinize it? What is the potential for abuse and mismanagement? Under the bill, any revenue from timber sales conducted under this plan will be turned over to the States, not to the Federal Treasury. This is a giveaway of Federal resources and Federal money, money earned from land that is owned by all the people of this country. Imagine if all the revenue from the Customs levees at New York were turned over to the State of New York. That is essentially what is happening here. We have heard that the bill has been changed to reflect expressed concerns about environmental impacts. It has indeed been changed at the last minute so that few people have had much time to examine the new text, but the changes have not in any way satisfied environmental concerns. Although most of the references to salvage have been removed from the bill, the substance has not changed. The bill is based on the premise that the best way to protect the forest health is to cut the forest down. The new improved bill not only allows cutting in roadless areas, cutting of large old-growth healthy trees, but it authorizes cutting in the name of so-called recovery if forest problems are merely anticipated or that somebody thinks there might be a problem at some time in the future. These practices are obviously ridiculous. They would not be limited to the size of the forest either. These are just some of the reasons why this bill creates bad public policy and should be defeated.","word.count":449,"sep11":-3.55056179775281,"years":1998.30898876404,"days":1178,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0418544476602936,"Topic 2":0.164305876671456,"Topic 3":0.0370336227915804,"Topic 4":0.0489259829183517,"Topic 5":0.0228629473985856,"Topic 6":0.354880111678369,"Topic 7":0.0925265788149981,"Topic 8":0.0244541685076449,"Topic 9":0.172871334859282,"Topic 10":0.0402849286994378},{"id":"10920060042560","body":"Harry Reid: Mr. President, as I said just a few minutes ago, I would be happy to have the two managers, with the appropriate staff--I have listed a number of amendments here: Mikulski-Warner-Snowe, Dorgan- Burns, Bond, Collins, Brownback, Stevens-Leahy, maybe the Allard amendment, which I haven't read in its entirety, but I think that is appropriate.

Kennelly: Mr. President, Members and their staffs need to be clear on what this particular debate is about and what it is not about. It is not about the merits of the Presidential campaign fund. It is not about the Watergate so-called reforms. What this amendment is about is fiscal integrity. Contained within the budget resolution is a provision which simply makes the Presidential election campaign fund tax form checkoff mechanism truly voluntary. In other words, it alters it so that the checkoff no longer diverts tax dollars from the Treasury. Instead, checking ``yes'' will deduct $3 from that person's tax refund. In sum, what this does is change the checkoff mechanism so that the nearly 90 percent of Americans who choose not to check ``yes'' are not forced to pay for the few who do. At the most recent checkoff rate, this modest alteration would save taxpayers about $70 million annually. As I said, this modest proposal does not abolish the Presidential system, as I would like. It does not get rid of the checkoff, as I would like. This is not a referendum on the merits of the Presidential election system. Presently, the checkoff's ``yes'' box constitutes a direct appropriation diverting tens of millions from the Treasury at the behest of a shrinking pool--13 percent and falling at last count--who check ``yes'' on their tax forms. As George Will so astutely pointed out in the Washington Post last year, the current checkoff mechanism is a bookkeeping dodge. He further elaborated: ``The checkoff involves not voluntary contributions but rather a diversion of scores of millions of dollars of general revenues to an unpopular program.'' Mr. President, the public's disdain for taxpayers financing of political campaigns is well known so I will not belabor it further at this time. The budget resolution provision quite simply would modify the checkoff mechanism so that people who oppose taxpayer funded political campaigns do not have to pay for those who check ``yes.'' The Senate has never voted on this specific question--it is not on the merits of the Presidential system--so I hope colleagues who support the Presidential spending limit system will give careful thought to making the checkoff mechanism honest by making it truly voluntary. Mr. President, we ought to consider expanding the checkoff format, in an add-on form. I am favorably disposed to include such a checkoff to raise funds for America's national parks--popular national treasures. There are no doubt other worthy endeavors which would be appropriate subjects of checkoffs to give Americans an opportunity to directly contribute, without impacting the budget. The Presidential fund is very unpopular and the checkoff is deceptive. To simply make it honest, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Thompson amendment. I would also advise Senators that the Kerry amendment is strongly opposed by the National Taxpayers Union and Citizens Against Government Waste. In the view of these good government groups, a vote against the Thompson amendment is a vote for taxpayers.","word.count":214,"sep11":-6.01404494382022,"years":1995.84550561798,"days":301,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.417237906970712,"Topic 2":0.295712138727033,"Topic 3":0.0317772896102274,"Topic 4":0.0183215335228295,"Topic 5":0.0798269617029147,"Topic 6":0.0108036736551501,"Topic 7":0.00552752272384072,"Topic 8":0.0670691367663553,"Topic 9":0.0084220557989399,"Topic 10":0.0653017805219981},{"id":"10419950126133","body":"Edward Kennedy: Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Wyoming for his able assistance in working out this compromise. Mr. President, we all agree that illegal aliens should not be eligible for Federal programs. The only exception is when the assistance is in the nature of emergency services. Both the Dole bill and the Democratic bill underscore this policy. But the situation is very different with respect to legal immigrants. They are lawfully in this country, and they make substantial contributions to our communities and to our Nation. They work, they create jobs, they pay taxes, they promote family values, and they contribute to the sciences, the arts and culture. In fact, legal immigrants contribute $25 to $35 billion more in taxes each year than they take out in services, including the educational costs of their children. We all want to get tough on illegal immigration. But the Dole proposal does so in a way that turns countless churches, synagogues, and community groups into immigration police. If they receive Government funds to operate soup kitchens, food pantries, battered women's shelters, rape crisis centers, and many other community services, they must now check a needy client's immigration status before they can provide assistance. This means that priests, ministers, rabbis, social workers, teachers, family crisis counselors, and community health workers must become immigration police and check for green cards before they can offer help or carry out their humanitarian work. Imagine a shattered young girl, brutally raped and requiring immediate care and counseling at a rape crisis center. If the center is even partially funded with Government money, under this bill, the center must first determine if the traumatized young victim is a citizen or noncitizen. They must find out whether she is here legally or illegally. If she is illegal, they can't help her. In addition, if she is a legal immigrant, they must determine if she has a sponsor, find out what the sponsor's income is, and determine whether deeming the sponsor's income makes her eligible or ineligible for Government-funded help. This same lengthy and complicated process would be repeated countless times all across the country. Priests must check the immigration status of the homeless and hungry at church soup kitchens. Social workers must check the status of battered women seeking protection. Teachers must check the status of children enrolling in Head Start programs. Rabbis must check the status of the elderly for assistance to the homebound. For example, in 1993, Catholic charities provided services to needy people across America--citizens and nonciti- zens alike--including food pantries, soup kitchens, homeless shelters, family counseling programs, and other valuable community assistance. More than 60 percent of the funding for these services came from Federal, State, and local governments. This assistance is provided on the basis of need. As a result, under the Dole bill, Catholic Charities would be required to check immigration status before they help anyone. We all agree that Head Start programs give children an effective early start toward a more successful and fulfilling future. But under the Dole bill, Head Start teachers would have to check children's green cards before they enter the program. The Department of Health and Human Services offers a partial list of noncash programs under its jurisdiction which would be affected by the harsh features of the Dole bill. Significant portions of these programs are administered by community-based organizations, churches, and other nonprofit groups, who would be required by the bill to check the immigration status of their clients. The list includes: Programs serving abused and neglected children and preventing family and domestic violence. Programs providing critical public health services to women and children, including maternal and child health. Early childhood development programs. Youth development and violence prevention programs. The Dole bill exempts school lunches, WIC, emergency Medicaid and certain other noncash programs. But if we are to avoid forcing the Nation's clergy and teachers and social workers to become immigration police by demanding green cards of their clients, we need to do more. Rather than list individually the additional programs which should be exempted from the bill, my amendment leaves the decision to the Attorney General in consultation with the head of the agency or department administering the assistance program. In that way, before a program is exempted from the bill, the law enforcement perspective of the Attorney General, together with the benefits perspective of the agency providing the assistance, will determine the decision. I believe my amendment represents a responsible compromise on this issue, and I urge its adoption.","word.count":755,"sep11":-6.14606741573034,"years":1995.71348314607,"days":254,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.191672868806019,"Topic 2":0.281021784673153,"Topic 3":0.0149112386651958,"Topic 4":0.0138216670114481,"Topic 5":0.453863324281958,"Topic 6":0.00830013927515664,"Topic 7":0.0053865384809708,"Topic 8":0.0169851569561165,"Topic 9":0.00555182277807224,"Topic 10":0.0084854590719102},{"id":"11020080016869","body":"Phil Gingrey: I appreciate the gentleman yielding And I appreciate the gentleman's intentions with his amendment. But I do have some serious concerns, and I briefly want to outline them, Madam Chairman. The protection of the names of WHINSEC students and staff is both a privacy and security issue, with broader implications for our international security cooperation. Publicizing the names of WHINSEC students in their home countries, where in some cases there are active guerilla or narcotrafficking insurgencies could expose these students to threats to their personal safety and, indeed, to that of their families. This could include hostile attention from nations, organizations and individuals that may wish to do harm to the United States, its friends and its allies. Such publication, Madam Chairman, could serve as a disincentive to foreign students who would otherwise want to attend WHINSEC, and it could discourage nations from sending their students to the institute. This would undercut the effectiveness of WHINSEC as a tool for building hemispheric security cooperation and communicating the democratic values and the respect for human rights that we champion. A further concern I have is that cooperative training at WHINSEC does not just involve military personnel. We're also training police forces, of which more are from Colombia than any other nation. Many of these personnel are involved in counterdrug operations when they return to their country. It is incomprehensible that we would put their names out there, likely to be published on the Web sites of radical protest groups and put at risk not only their ability to participate in counternarcotic operations, but also their lives. Indeed, Madam Chairman, we would be putting a bull's-eye on their backs. Madam Chairman, the gentleman noted that these names have been available upon request prior to 2005. That is true. Well, Madam Chairman, the world has changed. You used to be able to drive freely around this Capitol prior to 9/11. You used to be able to get on an airplane without going through metal detectors. Obviously, you can't do that now. The security environment in the western hemisphere has also changed. In his testimony before the House Armed Services Committee, Admiral Stavridis, the Commander of SOUTHCOM, testified, and I quote, ``Some trends in a few countries in SOUTHCOM's area of responsibility impede security cooperation, as their governments espouse vocal, anti-U.S. messages, and they undertake policies that portend a less stable and secure hemisphere.'' For most of the period of time when names were released, as Mr. McGovern was mentioning, Venezuela's foreign policy toward the United States was much different than it is now. We now also know that China is engaging militarily on a daily basis with the nations in our own backyard.

This legislation would allow the BBG to utilize a uniform visa category for all of its broadcast entities; allow the family members of those serving U.S. interests to integrate into U.S. life; and provide protection through permanent residency to those broadcasters whose lives may be threatened because they provide accurate information about dictatorships and corrupt officials abroad. U.S. international broadcasters continue to reach societies which live under regimes that censor the information available to their citizens. Some, after serving U.S. international broadcasting, are unable to return to their countries of origin for fear of retaliation against themselves or their families. Certain employees of Radio Free Iraq have been threatened with their lives because of the work they do to empower citizens through the free flow of accurate information. U.S. international broadcasting remains a vital part of our international effort to encourage democracy-building abroad. Its successes precede and follow the Cold War.

A lot has been said here today about motivations. Well, I won't talk about motivations, but I will talk about consequences of this legislation, of this amendment. The gentlewoman from Las Vegas, who has here on the floor lauded the merits of gambling, or gaming as she calls it, now offers an amendment to make this bill that we have fought for 8 years tighter and tougher on gambling? I don't think so. I will tell you that this is all about undoing what was done before. The gentleman from Michigan tells us that this is what Jack Abramoff would love to see. But this is exactly the same method that Jack Abramoff used to derail this bill 6 years ago and 5 years ago, by arguing that the legislation was not strong enough on prohibiting gambling, when he was representing gambling interests, a whole host of gambling interests, offshore interests, lottery interests, a whole host of gambling interests. And that is what is being attempted here today. This, Mr. Speaker, is an amendment that is clearly a poison pill designed to derail this legislation. Regardless of the intentions in offering it, 48 of 50 State attorneys general have come out in support of a ban on Internet gambling. An amendment such as this that restricts the right of States to continue to permit gambling within their borders is nothing more than an attempt to derail the bill by undermining the support from the States. That provision was in the previous versions of the bill; that provision is in this bill today, only it is even tighter. The States have always had the right to allow or prohibit gambling within their borders. H.R. 4411 continues to ensure that States have that right, while imposing strict safeguards to ensure that the activity stays within State borders and does not extend to other States. These safeguards include requiring that the bettor, the gambling business, and any entity acting with a gambling business to process the bets and wagers all be physically located within the authorizing State, and that age and residence requirements are effective and in place. Everyone knows that there is no technology that enables that to be done on the Internet and, therefore, there is no exception on this legislation for lotteries or any other form of State gambling on the Internet. Furthermore, H.R. 4411 gives new authority to State and Federal law enforcement to enforce the provisions of this bill to ensure that States comply with the safeguards established in the bill and that the law is enforced to the greatest extent possible. The Berkley-Conyers-Wexler amendment would limit what a State can do exclusively within its borders and infringes on the rights of the States that have always had the opportunity to create and enforce their own gambling laws. This amendment also deletes crucial language in the bill supported by the Department of Justice and the horse racing industry that maintains neutrality with respect to the Intrastate Horse Racing Act, a separate Federal statute that is not a part of this legislation unless you allow the supporters of this amendment to inject it into this bill. This amendment is nothing more than a poison pill that would kill this strong bipartisan legislation, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Berkley amendment.","word.count":565,"sep11":4.95505617977528,"years":2006.81460674157,"days":4206,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.320813264842814,"Topic 2":0.53758890262381,"Topic 3":0.00863381923821194,"Topic 4":0.0243260260943331,"Topic 5":0.0246920922689546,"Topic 6":0.00481628135588381,"Topic 7":0.00557413906806562,"Topic 8":0.0346509069017517,"Topic 9":0.0279688106506252,"Topic 10":0.0109357569555498},{"id":"10419950144997","body":"Dale Bumpers: Mr. President, the Senate has just acquitted itself very well by approving a list of ambassadors, particularly that of our former colleague, Jim Sasser.

It has to do with the issue of our national missile defense and the fact we passed legislation earlier this year on that subject, and we now hear the administration discussing its options under the National Missile Defense Act. We hear responses from around the world about the intent we have that is now in our law to deploy a limited national defense system. I want to speak on that subject for a minute or two. When we passed the National Missile Defense Act, we all realized, and the President did, too, when he signed it, that the ABM Treaty, the antiballistic missile defense treaty, that exists between the United States and Russia, prohibits the deployment of a national missile defense system and that the treaty would have to be amended if it was to remain in force. Some statements being made on the subject now by our own administration, as well as by Russian officials, cause me considerable concern. For example, the Secretary of State recently said that the administration was examining ``the possibility of adjusting [the ABM Treaty] slightly in order to have a National Missile Defense.'' Since article I of the treaty expressly prohibits a national missile defense, the Secretary's suggestion that only a slight adjustment is required in the treaty language is a huge understatement, and it is likely to mislead the Russians and others as well. The National Missile Defense Act acknowledges our policy of pursuing arms control arrangements, but it requires the deployment of a limited national missile defense which contradicts the initial premise of the ABM Treaty. A number of Russian Government officials have said they will not negotiate changes in the ABM Treaty. A Russian foreign ministry spokesman has been quoted as saying it is ``absolutely unacceptable to make any changes in the key provisions of the treaty and the Russian side does not intend to depart from this position.'' A Russian defense ministry official has said: ``There can be no compromise on this issue.'' Additionally, it has been reported that Russian and Chinese Government representatives have introduced a resolution in the U.N. General Assembly demanding the United States forego deployment of a missile defense system and strictly comply with the treaty's prohibition on territorial defense. It is entirely inappropriate for the U.N. to consider seriously a resolution that would presume to dictate to the United States what we should or should not do in defense of our own national security. Ballistic missile threats are real and have caused our Government to adopt a policy that requires a deployed national missile defense. It is my fervent hope our own Government will acknowledge clearly that the National Missile Defense Act means what it says and stop encouraging misunderstanding by the Russians, the Chinese, or anyone else of our intentions to defend ourselves against ballistic missile attack. We also hope the point will be made that we are not trying to undermine or threaten Russia's missile deterrent. Our relationship with Russia has improved considerably in recent years. I hope this new era of mutual respect and understanding will continue to be strengthened. We are getting into an unfortunate situation, however, where candor and honest exchange of information and intentions are taking a back seat to half-truths and bluster. The latter course will lead to misunderstanding and possibly disaster. At no time in the history of the relationship have honesty and unequivocal dialog been more important between Russia and the United States. The ABM Treaty is out of date and must be changed to reflect today's realities. The sooner everyone acknowledges this fact and gets busy negotiating the changes that are required, the better off we will all be.","word.count":630,"sep11":-1.92977528089888,"years":1999.9297752809,"days":1755,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0847343641457828,"Topic 2":0.0601629741333479,"Topic 3":0.00431857648020186,"Topic 4":0.153884950472523,"Topic 5":0.00148778796488979,"Topic 6":0.00190716816919813,"Topic 7":0.522485215853769,"Topic 8":0.00401691154100673,"Topic 9":0.164279871949846,"Topic 10":0.00272217928943607},{"id":"10419950129713","body":"Bob Dole: Mr. President, I am honored to have the opportunity to welcome, on behalf of the entire Senate, a distinguished delegation from the European Parliament here for the 43d European Parliament and U.S. Congress interparliamentary meeting.

The Johnston amendment takes care of the problem without exempting a rule from the bill, which is a very bad precedent. If we exempt one rule, everybody will be in here with their own special rules. We think all of the agencies should have the obligation under this bill to pass reasonable regulations. The Johnston amendment makes clear that the proposed rules in the pipeline as of April 1, 1995, will not have to redo cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment. This applies to the E. coli and food safety USDA-proposed rules, as well. Now, as I understand it--and I think it is a silly argument--those arguments for the Daschle amendment want a complete exemption for the Department of Agriculture rules because that would mean there would be no costly petition pursuant to section 633 of S. 343, and the petition need not be done. I call that silly because the petition process should lie for proposed rules prior to April 1, 1995. If it turns out that scientific assumptions underlying the bill are erroneous, or the rule turns out to be burdensome, why not allow for the petition and the agency rule? The rule would still be in effect if the petition is filed, so one can argue that safety will not be harmed. So we do not think that is essential. We think Johnston covers the problem and Dole does. We do not think there should be an exception for one aspect of regulation that would open the bill for all kinds of arguments that other aspects should be accepted at all. The petition process guarantees that we have the best science, and that petition process goes on for years.","word.count":288,"sep11":-6.32865168539326,"years":1995.5308988764,"days":189,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.119304282202311,"Topic 2":0.177834721760289,"Topic 3":0.488536285638692,"Topic 4":0.0108319039428842,"Topic 5":0.0971146378386818,"Topic 6":0.0106606463178302,"Topic 7":0.0669166552220457,"Topic 8":0.0142704467060408,"Topic 9":0.00981610849453051,"Topic 10":0.00471431187669545},{"id":"10620000052915","body":"Harry Reid: Mr. President, the reason I want to talk today is I think it is important for the minority to have its voice heard around here. The first of May is approaching, and we are again being called on to vote on the so-called marriage penalty bill. The majority will argue that if you support the marriage penalty, you must vote for cloture. That certainly is transparently false. Here is why. This procedural vote has nothing to do with limiting the marriage penalty, which the Democrats support certainly just as strongly as the Republicans. In fact, the vote is another attempt by Republicans to shield their deeply flawed tax bill from scrutiny by the Senate and by the public. In effect, we are being gagged. Republicans don't want to debate this bill because they don't want anyone to know what is really in it. In truth, it is marriage penalty relief in name only. Sixty percent of the measure on which we are going to vote today is for matters that have nothing to do with the marriage penalty. Sixty percent of the $248 billion proposal goes to people who do not face a marriage penalty. The majority likes to talk about relevance. I know a little bit about relevance, as I think most people do. Sixty percent of this bill is irrelevant to the marriage penalty. The majority is seeking to cut off debate on this bill before it is even begun. Invoking cloture would also block Democratic amendments that propose better ways to eliminate the marriage penalty and to address other urgent priorities such as prescription drug benefits for seniors. Democratic amendments say, yes, let's fix the marriage penalty for people who actually pay it. In fact, one of the amendments proposed by Senators Moynihan and Baucus, the lead Democrats in the Finance Committee, says: There are 65 marriage penalty provisions in the Tax Code with one sentence; let's eliminate all of them. That is one of the things we are being prevented from bringing forward. We want to move forward and start legislating the way this Senate has debated for over 200 years. We have agreed to say, OK, we are not going to go along with what the Senate has done for 200 years. We will play the game of the majority in an effort to allow our voices to be heard just a little bit. Even though the Standing Rules of the Senate don't require it, we have bent over backwards to keep our list of amendments short. We have 10 amendments, and we have agreed to limit debate on those amendments to 1 hour each. These are amendments by Senators Moynihan and Baucus on the tax proposal. Senator Bayh, one of the most thoughtful Senators we have ever had in the Senate, has talked about another alternative. We have amendments offered by Senator Schumer from New York dealing with the college tuition tax credit. We have one amendment by Senator Dorgan who represents the farm community. He wants to do something about CRP in the tax bill. These are amendments that should take several hours if they were debated properly. We are willing to take a half an hour and have the majority have a half an hour. That seems fair, but we have been prevented from doing that. We could finish this bill in 1 day. The question is, Why will Republicans not stop casting blame and get on with the marriage tax penalty vote? Sadly, the answer is somewhere blowing in the wind. Republicans know Democrats have better proposals. Republicans also know that given a choice, the American people prefer the minority's approach. The American people say give us marriage tax penalty relief and a few other things such as prescription drug benefits for senior citizens, who simply are desperate for some relief. The average senior citizen gets 18 drug prescriptions filled a year with no benefit at all from Medicare, and we need to get that benefit to them. That is what we are trying to do. The majority, once again, is afraid, despite having the majority. They have a 10-Member majority in the Senate and they are afraid to cast votes on our amendments. That goes to other issues, too, not only marriage tax penalty. The majority never tire of using procedural maneuvers to block or delay on the issues the American people care about most. The majority today is out of step with the American people on issue after issue, so this majority spends most of its energy plotting ways to disguise its own extreme agenda, scurrying to avoid responsibility for its continuing failure to take up the problems the voters sent us to address. That is why the majority constantly resorts to procedural devices such as cloture, or another favorite, the conference committee ``deep freeze,'' like they have done on the conference report on bankruptcy. We have been prevented from going forward with the Export Administration Act, which the high-tech community is very desirous of moving forward. Why? Because certain members of the majority think we are still in the cold war and we cannot go forward with bringing high- tech industry into the modern world. That also takes into consideration our inability to go forward on the Juvenile Justice Act, which deals with gun safety for children, Patients' Bill of Rights, and a number of other things. The majority leader said on February 3: He is right. Whenever the majority, the Republicans who control Congress, are out of the public eye they seem to be better off. It is when the public sees how out of step they are that they get into trouble. That is what is going on. No one should be deceived. We are ready to go to work right now. We are simply waiting for the majority to stop their foot-dragging and blame games, stop hiding their faulty legislation behind procedural votes and get serious. When the majority works up the courage to have a real debate on these issues, to stand up and be counted on their ideas versus our ideas, we hope they will let us know. Until then, Republicans can file cloture as often as they like. It is a cynical and not very clever blame game. The Democrats are sick and tired of playing it, but we will continue to fight.","word.count":1061,"sep11":-1.41011235955056,"years":2000.44943820225,"days":1940,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.886883901119643,"Topic 2":0.036723135312318,"Topic 3":0.00808125932324658,"Topic 4":0.0196394581575494,"Topic 5":0.00799578498922115,"Topic 6":0.00851773840955408,"Topic 7":0.00624315660985525,"Topic 8":0.0143926544219609,"Topic 9":0.00804402290837775,"Topic 10":0.00347888874827398},{"id":"10820040057255","body":"Gordon Smith: Mr. President, I today speak about the need for hate crimes legislation.

I probably do not speak with the same passion he does, but I do want to say that he has it completely wrong. You cannot ignore the fact that since 1980 bankruptcies have increased from around 330,000 in that year to just under 1.4 million in 1999. That is a fact that cannot be ignored. Consequently, it seems to me to be completely wrong for some other Senator to say we do not have a bankruptcy problem in the United States. Congress ought to deal with it, and changing the law will help. I do not pretend changing the law is going to entirely respond to that problem, but the extent to which it does, we should do it because this increase in bankruptcies is a huge increase. The small dip in the filings that Senator Kennedy has referred to will not erase this very basic, fundamental problem we have in our economy with the bankruptcy laws. We have a real bankruptcy crisis on our hands. We cannot ignore that. Perhaps the Senator from Massachusetts does not remember what his own President said in the State of the Union Address. The President of the United States said, just a few days ago, these are prosperous times. People are not in bankruptcy then because of hard times. If this is a problem when we have very prosperous times, what sort of a bankruptcy problem are we going to have when we have a recession or a depression? One other point that the Senator from Massachusetts spent a great deal of time on is how he sees the problems of minimum wage in this bill. There is a minimum wage increase in this bill. It isn't there because we Republicans sought to join minimum wage with the bankruptcy bill. We were going to debate minimum wage at another time. We were going to increase minimum wage at another time, but it was the Democratic Party that made a decision to put minimum wage on the bankruptcy bill. I do not even like nongermane things being included on other pieces of legislation, but it is a pattern too often adopted and too readily accepted in the Senate. So it is done. But on this side of the aisle, I argued that we should not mix minimum wage with bankruptcy. I do not want the weight of that issue, as important as increasing the minimum wage is, with the issue of reforming the bankruptcy code. But on the other side of the aisle they chose to do it. So what do we hear? Now we are hearing complaints about the minimum wage bill on the bankruptcy bill. We are hearing threats about instructing conferees to do something about it. If it is a problem, it is a problem because the other side of the aisle made it a problem by including it. I remind them that they ought to be very careful what they wish for because sometimes they get it. The Senator from Massachusetts has asked who will win and who will lose. Under this bill, the honest American people, who have to pay the higher prices because other people go into bankruptcy and do not pay their bills--because we have deadbeats out there--are the ones who will win by this legislation. We still preserve the historic principle of our bankruptcy laws that some people who are in debt, through no fault of their own, are entitled to a fresh start. But when it comes to this basic principle of economics that there is no free lunch, there is no free lunch in bankruptcy, either. Somebody pays. In this particular instance, the honest American consumer is paying $400, for a family of four, to cover debts of somewhere between $30 billion and $50 billion a year that go unpaid because of people who ought to be paying their bills. Worse yet, we have a situation where some people who do have the ability to pay their bills are not paying their bills, either. We are sending a clear signal that those who have the ability to pay are not going to get off scot-free. I relinquish the remainder of our time. Hopefully, we can proceed, then, to the next amendment.","word.count":107,"sep11":-1.8623595505618,"years":1999.99719101124,"days":1779,"party":"Other","chamber":"","Topic 1":0.0336620904779597,"Topic 2":0.298481990931408,"Topic 3":0.0998565183030425,"Topic 4":0.0195087266238619,"Topic 5":0.018449831836251,"Topic 6":0.0117720007170499,"Topic 7":0.00614280370575467,"Topic 8":0.00927679094422106,"Topic 9":0.497736492983727,"Topic 10":0.00511275347672434},{"id":"11020080004854","body":"Tom Price: Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for her comments and for her perspective and for bringing more light and truth to this issue.

I think it is important in this hour of special orders to really discuss what is reform. The choice before this Congress is going to very clear. One bill will come before us that says we need to spend more money in campaigns. The other bill will be coming before us that says we have to spend less. I believe that less money is reform. More power to small contributors is reform. Preventing rich people from buying public office is reform. Eliminating soft money is reform. Leveling the playing field is reform. Limiting special influence in campaigns is reform. The bill that I authored, called the Farr bill does all these things. The Farr bill is reform. The Farr bill imposes voluntary spending limits. It imposes aggregate PAC limits. It reduces the PAC's max out from $10,000 to $8,000. It imposes aggregate large donor limits. Large donor in my bill is defined as anyone who gives $200 or more. It provides public benefits to all candidates, challengers, and incumbents alike. It levels the playing field for those who abide by the spending limits. It curbs campaign persuasion mail that is sent out under the phony guise of educational information. The American people want reform, not more of the same. For a Congress that despite its partisan differences has addressed the issue of reform, the gift ban, the lobbying reform, the congressional compliance, we should not let the opportunity for real campaign finance reform get away from us now. The American people want this. In the past months my office has logged 368 constituent letters in support of limits on money in congressional raises. In that same period of time, my office has logged exactly two constituent letters against limits on money in congressional races. I submit to my colleagues, if they check their offices, I think they will find the same ratio. My bill, which I hope to offer on Thursday during the floor debate, has one priority and one priority only: To control campaign spending. The money chase now in this country is out of control. In the past years, Congress has tried to put the break on the money chase. But each time the Republican leadership has prevented that from happening. Let us look at the record. In 1987, the Republicans filibustered a camapaign fiance bill in the Senate. In 1989, the House passed a bill but the Republicans delayed action in 1990 and set it until it was too late to appoint the conferees. In 1991, the House and Senate passed bills and later, in 1992, a final conference report was signed and sent to President George Bush and he vetoed it. In 1993, the House and Senate passed bills but in 1994, the Republicans blocked the appointment of conferees. Since 1987, Democrats have been in the forefront of moving campaign finance reform. Here we are again today. We have toiled at bringing campaign finance reform to American politics for nearly a decade. We will not rest until we get it. The Democrat bill which I offer contains real reform that will make real changes to the electoral process in this country. My will seeks to reduce the power of money in elections and return that power to the people. Too much money too often decides who gets to Congress and who does not. Congress should be more reflective of the American population. Right now Congress is full of, and I must admit, white males like me. But my bill levels the playing field so that we will see more minorities, more women, more moderate income persons serving in the United States Congress, those who can run for office and be competitive. If we do not stop the money chase, if we do not stop wealthy people from buying office, this Congress will be one big elitist white boys club. If we do not impose some limits, as my bill does, if we do not enhance disclosure requirements, as my bill does, if we do not level the playing field, as my bill does, the American people will continue to complain about the influence of money in elections, about not being able to trace where the money comes from, about Congress not doing what it is supposed to to clean up the system. We have a chance this week on Thursday to clean up the system. I urge Members to take a look at my bill, take a look, and I speak to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, take a look at H.R. 3505 and join me in voting for something that is really positive. Join me in showing the American people that like the gift ban, like lobbying reform, like the compliance act, this Congress can do what is right and enact serious reform to bring order out of chaos.","word.count":828,"sep11":-5.28932584269663,"years":1996.5702247191,"days":559,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.249825145985276,"Topic 2":0.0179780192690243,"Topic 3":0.230014228394587,"Topic 4":0.0163863077942902,"Topic 5":0.141805788637641,"Topic 6":0.156409779477874,"Topic 7":0.00284388356133068,"Topic 8":0.173838484012337,"Topic 9":0.00540258683055263,"Topic 10":0.00549577603708749},{"id":"10820040031380","body":"Frank Pallone: Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, the gentlewoman from California , for yielding me this time and for her role in bringing this resolution up on the suspension list today. It is with distinct honor and pleasure that I stand before this Chamber today to speak in support of House Resolution 778. Count Basie was born in my district and spent the first 20 years or so of his life in my district, and I would like to kind of recount some of the events that occurred in my district during those early years. This bill recognizes and celebrates the incredible contribution that William ``Count'' Basie has made to jazz and swing music. Furthermore, it is only fitting we acknowledge his pivotal role this year, marking the 100th anniversary of his birth. He was born, as was stated previously by my colleagues, on August 21, 1904, in his parents' home on Mechanic Streets in Red Bank, New Jersey, which has been in my district the entire time I have been in Congress, and even prior to the time I represented the area. And Count Basie is highly regarded in our area, as well as obviously nationally, as one of the best and most influential musicians and composers of the last century. The city of Red Bank, where he was born, gave the young William Basie his first exposure to music and the title of one of the most famous tunes associated with his band, ``The Kid From Red Bank''; and it is evidence the city of Red Bank has had on his early musical development. As a child, Basie would do chores at the Palace Theater in Red Bank so that he could get in free. One day when the Palace's house piano player was unable to travel from New York, Basie offered to fill in for him, but the manager declined the offer. Basie simply waited until the picture had started, then snuck into the pit and accompanied the film anyway on the piano. He was invited back to play the evening show. Years later, Basie would trace his lifelong interest in the organ to his experiences at the Lyric Theater, another theater in Red Bank, New Jersey, where he would listen to the organ played by Henry La Ross. Many are surprised to learn that William Basie's first love was not the piano, but rather the drums. However, his aspiration went towards a different direction when he met Sonny Greer, a young talented drummer from nearby Long Branch, New Jersey, which is actually my hometown. The young men quickly realized where their true respective talents really laid, and the drums and piano duo went on to win first place in an Asbury Park piano competition, one of the first of many honors bestowed upon Basie throughout his career. Asbury Park is also in my district, Mr. Speaker, and some of my colleagues know that Asbury Park was made famous also by Bruce Springstein, another one of our constituents. Count Basie was awarded with a total of nine Grammys throughout his career, including the Grammy Trustees Award from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences in 1981. In addition, he was the recipient of an American Jazz Masters Award from the National Endowment of the Arts in 1983, and in 1996, he was bestowed the honor of a Commemorative Stamp by the United States Postal Office. And I assure Members myself and many others in my district have lots of those stamps. Today, the Count Basie Theater in Red Bank, New Jersey stands as a testament to the life, career and accomplishments of this innovative and ingenious musician. In 1984, the historic theater, which first opened its doors in 1926, was renamed to honor Count Basie. Much of the theater has been preserved and remains true to its original appearance. The theater is now owned and operated by Count Basie Theater, Inc., a nonprofit corporation formed solely to operate the theater for the benefit of the community, and one cannot help but think this is exactly how the ``Kid from Red Bank'' would have liked it.

I find myself year after year after year giving voice to those Vietnam veterans who still are suffering as a result of their service in Vietnam. Thirty years ago agent orange was sprayed in Vietnam--30 years ago--and we are still debating the bias of each individual analyzing the evidence of its health impact on the veterans and their children. The families who suffer deserve our cooperation. It is time to stop debating and move forward. This amendment does just that. It takes another crucial step forward in repaying our debt to those who have served their country. In some cases, that is a dear debt, indeed. The legacy of Vietnam has cast its dark shadow on many aspects of our daily lives, changed the way many of us think and view war. Today we seek to address the shadow that has been cast over some children of Vietnam veterans. Mr. President, the amendment we are proposing today would extend health care and related benefits to children of Vietnam veterans who suffer from spina bifida, a serious neural tube birth defect that requires life-long care--provided, of course, the children were conceived after the veterans began their service in Vietnam. These children have become the next innocent victims, victims in a long line, who are suffering from the effect of agent orange. Senator Daschle, Senator Rockefeller, I and many others have worked for the past decade to try to bring to a fair and just resolution the questions surrounding agent orange and the effects it has had on the men and women who faithfully served this country. In 1991, we coauthored the agent orange Act of 1991 which required the Institute of Medicine--part of the National Academy of Sciences--to conduct a scientific review of all evidence pertaining to the connection between exposure to agent orange and other herbicides used in Vietnam and subsequent occurrence of health-related conditions. As a result of this law, a report was issued by the National Academy of Sciences in March 1993 and it was to be followed by biennial updates for the next 10 years. The first report published by the National Academy of Sciences in 1993 created four categories to classify the level of association between certain health conditions and exposure to agent orange. Category I contains conditions for which there is sufficient evidence of an association. Category II contains conditions for which there is limited or suggestive evidence of an association. After 1993, the VA provided compensation for all conditions contained in categories I and II. Conditions for which there is inadequate or insufficient evidence to determine whether an association exists were placed in category III and compensation was not provided for them. When the latest of the NAS biennial updates was issued in March of this year, it cited new evidence supporting the link between exposure to agent orange and the occurrence of spina bifida in children of veterans who served in Vietnam. The NAS panel moved ``spina bifida in offspring'' from category III into category II, based on the results of three epidemiological studies which suggest that a father's exposure to herbicides may put his children at a greater risk of being born with spina bifida. The Ranch Hand Study, which examined a group of veterans who were directly involved with spraying 19 million gallons of chemical defoliant in Vietnam during the war, was the largest of these studies. Over the past 2 years the results of the Ranch Hand study have been reanalyzed by the U.S. Air Force, and this new analysis reinforced evidence of a connection between agent orange exposure and spina bifida in offspring that had been found in other studies. This ultimately led to the committee's conclusion that there is limited or suggestive evidence of an association. I ask unanimous consent to place an article in the Record that discusses at length the basis of these findings. There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:","word.count":686,"sep11":-6.80056179775281,"years":1995.05898876404,"days":21,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.140551692876194,"Topic 2":0.133711482960843,"Topic 3":0.138519628240134,"Topic 4":0.216745814010021,"Topic 5":0.261263693678813,"Topic 6":0.00788891670446099,"Topic 7":0.00304810660544368,"Topic 8":0.0600628139213741,"Topic 9":0.0239071869121849,"Topic 10":0.014300664090531},{"id":"10519980030043","body":"Carrie Meek: Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word Mr. Chairman, I will not take but a second because I certainly do not want to threaten my colleagues' time with this wonderful amendment.

Ever since GEN George Washington defeated the British at Yorktown, American soldiers have honorably defended the cause of liberty in conflicts at home and, indeed, around the world. Today, our men and women in uniform are bravely waging the war on terror, taking the battle to the enemy so that the enemy does not do battle here at home. America thanks our soldiers for their dedication, for their determination, and for their patriotism. We honor the 25 million living veterans who have served their country in past wars with honor and courage. And we remember those patriots who have given the ultimate sacrifice in service to their country. Two years ago, I had the privilege of attending the dedication of the National World War II Memorial. It was the largest gathering of surviving veterans in 60 years and an experience I will never forget. One of the veterans was asked how did they do it, how did ordinary young men set aside their fear in the face of extraordinary odds against determined enemies. The veteran replied simply: One of the inscriptions on the monument is a quote by President Truman. It embodies the patriotic spirit of this annual remembrance.

I might add that that is just the Congressional Research Service's figure. That does not include numerous other incidents of flag desecration that may have occurred, and it does not account for the millions of people who have seen our flag desecrated. Some say there is no need for this amendment, that it is not constitutional. Those who say that have not read the Constitution very carefully, particularly article V. Amending the Constitution is the mechanism provided by the Founding Fathers to enable us, among other things, to correct wrongful decisions by the Supreme Court. That is why we have article V in there, to be able to amend the Constitution. By the way, there are 27 amendments to the Constitution, not 26 as stated by Senator Chafee. I might say this to those who say there is no need for the amendment and that we are not faced with many flag desecrations: First, if we fail to provide legal protection to the American flag, it is we, as Members of Congress, who would be devaluating the flag. As Justice Stevens, one of our more liberal Justices, stated in his dissent in Johnson, ``Sanctioning the public desecration of the flag will tarnish its value--both for those who cherish the ideas for which it waves and for those who desire to don the robes of martyrdom by burning it.'' One year later, in Eichman, Justice Stevens wrote that the value of the flag as a symbol of the ideas of liberty, equality, and tolerance that Americans have passionately defended throughout our history has already been damaged as a result of this Court's decision to place its stamp of approval on the act of flag burning. We can and should act to correct that damage by restoring to Congress the power to protect our flag against physical desecration. Moreover, the problem of flag desecration remains with us. I have to say that, earlier this year for example, two American flags were burned in Honolulu as a show of sovereignty for what protesters called the Kingdom of Hawaii and as a protest against statehood. There were other flag burnings during protests in Illinois and Pennsylvania. Last year, there was a flag burning during a demonstration against proposition 187 in California. A college student who tried to prevent a second such desecration was beaten by the protesters. In another instance, an American flag was burned during a news conference outside police headquarters in Cleveland, OH, after the U.S. Supreme Court let stand an Ohio Supreme Court ruling overturning the conviction of an individual who burned an American flag during a protest against the Persian Gulf war. Another flag burning occurred during a demonstration against capital punishment in Nebraska. I suspect there are many others. To compare the burning of the flag by a Boy Scout--a soiled or otherwise worn out flag--to that of the bearded Gregory Johnson, is, I think, stretching it just a wee bit. Johnson held the flag in contempt, and there is no doubt that his burning of the flag was done for publicity purposes, so that millions of Americans would see and be affected by how he treated our flag. Perhaps the Senator from Rhode Island sees little difference between the bearded protester burning a flag to start a riot and the Boy Scout who ceremoniously burns a flag to dispose of it, as Boy Scouts are taught to do when flags are soiled or otherwise ruined. Without this amendment they are both treated exactly the same. I find that offensive and reprehensible that we treat the respectful action of a young Boy Scout in burning a soiled or otherwise wornout flag, the same as the conduct--and it is ``action,'' not speech--of a Gregory Johnson. Without this amendment, they are both treated the same. Do my friends who make these kinds of arguments want there to be 60 Gregory Johnsons running around defiling the flag without fear of sanction? They may, but 80 percent of Americans disagree with them, and rightfully so. They may, but 312 of our colleagues over in the House disagree with them, and rightfully so. They may, but 49 State legislatures, including that of the Senator's own home State of Rhode Island, disagree with him. And the other supporters of this amendment, Republicans and Democrats alike, disagree with him as well. I have to respectfully take exception with a few of my colleagues when they ask why we are taking time to consider this amendment when we have so many important things to do. We spend time around here in so many desultory ways that do not amount to a hill of beans; it is about time we spent time on something this significant. Ask the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Gold Star Wives of America, and the millions of members of organizations who have joined together in the Citizens Flag Alliance why they brought us this proposal, or why they asked us to debate it. Mr. President, we are debating legislation these Americans consider a high priority. There are millions of them. I hope that the opponents of this measure would not argue that this citizen-initiated effort is unworthy of the debate by this august body. I suggest my colleagues would be candid and should get all our work, including this amendment, done. There is nothing that would stop us from doing that; all we have to do is do it. I would also call to my colleagues' attention the fact that it was a very short time after the Bill of Rights was passed that the 11th amendment to the Constitution was added to it. Why? It was added to it to overturn a bad Supreme Court decision, Chism versus Jordan. There have been other amendments to the Constitution overturning bad Supreme Court decisions. I think you have to look long and hard to find a Supreme Court decision much worse than the Johnson and Eichman decisions. They were 5-to-4 decisions, hotly contested. By the way, some of the most liberal people on the Court disagreed with those decisions, such as Justice Stevens. In the past, some of the most liberal Justices on the Court, including Chief Justice Warren, Abe Fortas, Hugo Black, a first amendment absolutist, and Justice Stevens, just to mention four, have all stated we have a right to protect the flag. Now, all of a sudden, because of a wrong-headed 5-to-4 decision, the law is otherwise. Unfortunately, it cannot be changed by mere statute, as some would like to do so. The fact of the matter is, why do we have any concern at all? Why would we take so much time debating this when we ought to pass it without even much of a debate? Let the States determine whether they want to ratify this as an amendment to our Constitution. Amending the Constitution is not a simple task. That is why we only have 27 amendments to the Constitution. Not only do we have to have a two-thirds vote in both bodies of congress, but we then have to get three-quarters of the States to ratify any proposed amendment. The reasons some of my friends do not want this amendment to be adopted are multifold, I am sure. I will not denigrate their reasons or patriotism in the process, but they should not denigrate ours, either, especially since we are in the vast majority, and the vast majority of people in this country feel the way we do. The fact of the matter is that if three-quarters of the States would vote to ratify this, then it ought to be in the Constitution. I'd bet money that three-quarters of the States would ratify this amendment so fast that it would make the head of my dear friend from Rhode Island spin in the process. The fact of the matter is this is what the American people want, and the reason they want it, is because they value the flag of the United States, and devalue those who would hold it in contempt, as they should.","word.count":1368,"sep11":-5.90168539325843,"years":1995.95786516854,"days":341,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.129391568228771,"Topic 2":0.0504762733171182,"Topic 3":0.0368099073492844,"Topic 4":0.221586545538239,"Topic 5":0.00670119586729124,"Topic 6":0.333496957079705,"Topic 7":0.00532593026974151,"Topic 8":0.19454712643273,"Topic 9":0.0169178672621151,"Topic 10":0.00474662865500532},{"id":"10419950142013","body":"Speaker: 12170 of November 14, 1979. This report is submitted pursuant to section 204 of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703 and section 505 of the International Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1985, 22 U.S.C. 2349aa-9. This report covers events through September 29, 1995. My last report, dated May 18, 1995, covered events through April 18, 1995. 1. On March 15 of this year by Executive Order No. 12957, I declared a separate national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and imposed separate sanctions. Executive Order No. 12959, issued May 6, 1995, then significantly augmented those new sanctions. As a result, as I reported on September 18, 1995, in conjunction with the declaration of a separate emergency and the imposition of new sanctions, the Iranian Transactions Regulations, 31 CFR Part 560, have been comprehensively amended. There have been no amendments to the Iranian Assets Control Regulations, 31 CFR Part 535, since the last report. However, the amendments to the Iranian Transactions Regulations that implement the new separate national emergency are of some relevance to the Iran- United States Claims Tribunal and related activities. For example, sections 560.510, 560.513, and 560.525 contain general licenses with respect to, and provide for specific licensing of, certain transactions related to arbitral activities. 2. The Tribunal, established at The Hague pursuant to the Algiers Accords, continues to make progress in arbitrating the claims before it. Since my last report, the Tribunal has rendered four awards, bringing the total number to 566. As of September 29, 1995, the value of awards to successful American claimants from the Security Account held by the NV Settlement Bank stood at $2,368,274,541.67. Iran has not replenished the Security Account established by the Accords to ensure payment of awards to successful U.S. claimants since October 8, 1992. The Account has remained continuously below the $500 million balance required by the Algiers Accords since November 5, 1992. As of September 29, 1995, the total amount in the Security Account was $188,105,627.95, and the total amount in the Interest Account was $32,066,870.62. Therefore, the United States continues to pursue Case A/28, filed in September 1993, to require Iran to meet its obligations under the Accords to replenish the Security Account. Iran filed its Statement of Defense in that case on August 31, 1995. The United States is preparing a Reply for filing on December 4, 1995. [[Page S 17665]] 3. The Department of State continues to present other United States Government claims against Iran, in coordination with concerned government agencies, and to respond to claims brought against the United States by Iran, in coordination with concerned government agencies. In September 1995, the Departments of Justice and State represented the United States in the first Tribunal hearing on a government-to- government claim in 5 years. The Full Tribunal heard arguments in Cases A/15 and A/24. Case A/15 is an interpretive dispute in which Iran claims that the United States has violated the Algiers Accords by its alleged failure to terminate all litigation against Iran in U.S. courts. Case A/24 involves a similar interpretive dispute in which, specifically, Iran claims that the obligation of the United States under the Accords to terminate litigation prohibits a lawsuit against Iran by the McKesson Corporation from proceeding in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The McKesson Corporation reactivated that litigation against Iran in the United States following the Tribunal's negative ruling on Foremost McKesson Incorporated's claim before the Tribunal. Also in September 1995, Iran filed briefs in two cases, to which the United States is now preparing responses. In Case A/11, Iran filed its Hearing Memorial and Evidence. In that case, Iran has sued the United States for $10 billion, alleging that the United States failed to fulfill its obligations under the Accords to assist Iran in recovering the assets of the former Shah of Iran. Iran alleges that the United States improperly failed to freeze the U.S. assets of the Shah's estate and certain U.S. assets of close relatives of the Shah; report to Iran all known information about such assets; and otherwise assist Iran in such litigation. In Case A/15, 3 years after the Tribunal's partial award in the case, Iran filed briefs and evidence relating to 10 of Iran's claims against the United States Government for nonmilitary property allegedly held by private companies in the United States. Although Iran's submission was made in response to a Tribunal order directing Iran to file its brief and evidence ``concerning all remaining issues to be decided by this Case,'' Iran's filing failed to address many claims in the case. In August 1995, the United States filed the second of two parts of its consolidated submission on the merits in Case B/61, addressing issues of liability and compensation. As reported in my May 1995 Report, Case B/61 involves a claim by Iran for compensation with respect to primarily military equipment that Iran alleges it did not receive. The equipment was purchased pursuant to commercial contracts with more than 50 private American companies. Iran alleges that it suffered direct losses and consequential damages in excess of $2 billion in total because the United States Government's refusal to allow the export of the equipment after January 19, 1981, in alleged contravention of the Algiers Accords. 4. Since my last report, the Tribunal has issued two important awards in favor of U.S. nationals considered dual United States-Iranian nationals by the Tribunal. On July 7, 1995, the Tribunal issued Award No. 565, awarding a claimant $1.1 million plus interest for Iran's expropriation of the claimant's shares in the Iranian architectural firm of Abdolaziz Farmafarmaian &amp; Associates. On July 14, 1995, the Tribunal issued Award No. 566, awarding two claimants $129,869 each, plus interest, as compensation for Iran's taking real property inherited by the claimants from their father. Award No. 566 is significant in that it is the Tribunal's first decision awarding dual national claimants compensation for Iran's expropriation of real property in Iran. 5. The situation reviewed above continues to implicate important diplomatic, financial, and legal interests of the United States and its nationals and presents an unusual challenge to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The Iranian Assets Control Regulations issued pursuant to Executive Order No. 12170 continue to play an important role in structuring our relationship with Iran and in enabling the United States to implement properly the Algiers Accords. I shall continue to exercise the powers at my disposal to deal with these problems and will continue to report periodically to the Congress on significant developments.

And, roughly speaking, and this is ballpark but it is about right, up until 40, 50 percent market share is achieved in a merger, the FTC and the Department of Justice will permit the merger. It is actually more complex than that. It is done under an index called the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index. But the FTC and Justice will oftentimes make an analysis of will there be potential competition. Will another hospital enter if the existing merged entity extracts a higher price.

Lazio: Madam Chairman, I want to take a moment to express my deepest sorrow over the tragedy of TWA flight 800, which went down just last night off the shore of my own home on Long Island. Our thoughts and our prayers are with the families of the victims as they deal with their loss, and our gratitude goes to the rescuers throughout the country who are helping to recover important evidence. Today almost 1.5 million people in my home State of New York are receiving some sort of public assistance. That is a big number. And far too often that is exactly how these people are treated, as numbers to be fed into a broken welfare system, processed and pushed out again. The current system is inefficient, unfair and damaging to those it is supposed to help. Is this how we are supposed to show compassion? I think we can do better. This reform will replace our failed welfare system with one based on individual responsibility, accountability and hope for future generations. By destroying the work ethic and encouraging fathers to leave home, our current system results in broken families, a disintegration of moral standards and devastated communities. In contrast, these reforms would strengthen families, require able- bodied recipients to work, attack fraud and abuse, and crack down on deadbeat parents. Most importantly, it provides hope for children by giving them the tools to break the cruel cycle of dependency. We will give them the incentive and tools to break out of the welfare trap that holds them down and limits their potential. By honoring work we allow people to assume responsibilities for themselves. By providing more funding, more funding for child care, we will provide them with the opportunity to provide a better life for their children and end the cycle of dependency that has resulted in families raising a fourth generation on public assistance. As a result of a welfare system that discourages two-parent families, today's illegitimacy rate among welfare families has continued to rise. This plan seeks to reverse this trend by increasing efforts to establish paternity and by demanding deadbeat fathers pay child support. Under the plan all mothers will be encouraged to identify the father of their children or face the risk of reduced benefits. Most importantly, this reform gives hope to our children, the most defenseless victims of our current system. The system fosters dependency, crime, violence and despair, yet somehow we expect children born and raised under these circumstances to be able to break the cycle of dependency. That is simply not fair. Madam Chairman, I am proud to support this bill. It moves us in the right direction.","word.count":446,"sep11":-5.28370786516854,"years":1996.57584269663,"days":561,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0413098974718612,"Topic 2":0.00910335162034386,"Topic 3":0.0947731289761644,"Topic 4":0.660138855154305,"Topic 5":0.0190008202582662,"Topic 6":0.0541537928858348,"Topic 7":0.00251311441250262,"Topic 8":0.0166933487429422,"Topic 9":0.0632747179872831,"Topic 10":0.0390389724904964},{"id":"10620000042934","body":"Don Young: Mr. Speaker, we can do both.

Inevitably, the signals go out and the supplies increase. Even under the marketing loan concept, in which it is unlikely that there will be the buildup of forfeitures and the buildup of governmental storage that characterized previous situations, there still is a glut on the market. The surplus does not disappear. Price signals were out there for a purpose. They indicated who wanted to utilize the commodity, who could utilize the commodity. Tragically, in this country, we are utilizing commodities about as well as we are going to. The up-side potential that we talked about today on the export side is the difference. That is where the thrust has to occur. To have a domestic transfer of income simply hides the problem; it doesn't market the commodities. The costs do not decrease for farmers in the field, although much that we have done this year in terms of our research bill might assist people in bringing about lower costs. I commend all of my colleagues who have spoken to this issue today for their concern. They have spoken with sincerity. They are advocates of producers in their States and of American agriculture generally. Many are Members of the Senate Committee on Agriculture and participate regularly in trying to think along with the majority and minority how we can deal with these problems. But, Mr. President, we have debated, as was pointed out earlier by various Senators, this issue on at least a couple of occasions. On one occasion, the distinguished Senator from Montana, who is on the floor now, discussed a lengthening of payment of the loan rate. He did not press for a vote on that occasion. But then on the appropriations bill, an amendment was offered by the distinguished minority leader of the Senate, Senator Daschle, that had very similar characteristics with regard to the caps on the loan rate. The Senate voted 56 to 43 after extensive debate that took, as I recall, the better part of 4 hours on that occasion. We have revisited the issue for another 4 hours this afternoon, and it is probably worthy of considerably more attention. I suspect the problem is that the Senate is also attempting to deal with the Interior appropriations bill in addition to problems of agriculture. It will not be a good idea to adopt this amendment. I have listened carefully to others who have spoken. But we ought to defeat this amendment. Therefore, Mr. President, I commend my colleagues for their sincerity, but after a consultation with and on behalf of the majority leader I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.","word.count":475,"sep11":-3.07022471910112,"years":1998.7893258427,"days":1349,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0145092137424252,"Topic 2":0.124957087018544,"Topic 3":0.0099337086471239,"Topic 4":0.00437509693692754,"Topic 5":0.437613209457675,"Topic 6":0.00554282034420961,"Topic 7":0.0045930139982374,"Topic 8":0.378853697926431,"Topic 9":0.00763158370171326,"Topic 10":0.0119905682267134},{"id":"11020070006311","body":"John F.

It is an effort we have been pursuing in the Science, Technology, and Space Subcommittee. I am very pleased to have the Presiding Officer of the Senate on the subcommittee and pleased that he is in the chair as we discuss this legislation tonight. This is a subject we have been working on since September 11 and the tragedy that struck our country that day. We are all aware that the public sector, government, military, and law enforcement have begun a very significant mobilization effort to fight terrorism. It is a laudatory effort, one I fully support. This public effort is not going to be successful alone, if we don't take steps to tap the tremendous technology and science talents of America's private sector. Considering the enormous technological challenges faced on September 11, the quality of emergency response is more than exceptional. But the many private companies and their science and technology experts who rushed to offer their help that day have told our committee they can do more. They can move faster, and they can help save more lives if the U.S. Congress provides a portal, an opportunity for them to more accessibly participate and offer their talents. That is why the legislation Senator Allen and I offered today, the Science and Technology Emergency Mobilization Act, provides an opportunity to tap those talents of the private sector. It doesn't create a large bureaucracy. It is not going to snarl our private companies in red tape. It is simply going to provide a gateway to bring the resources of the private sector to bear in the war against terrorism. I believe, just as John F. Kennedy gave America's youth a forum for public service, now is the time for our Government to throw open its doors to a new generation raised on information technologies that will be able to respond to the wide variety of technology and science- related challenges that arise in the wake of a terrorist attack or other disaster. The legislation we are offering today offers four opportunities to capitalize on the immense technology resources of our Nation. One I am especially pleased about would establish a virtual technology reserve. As my colleagues know, we have a strategic petroleum reserve in our country. It is an energy insurance policy, an energy bank, in effect, that we can tap when we are in a crunch with respect to oil products. I think we ought to look at technology as the same sort of resource. So we have created a virtual technology reserve in our legislation that would allow communities all across this country to put in place a preexisting database of private sector equipment and expertise that they could call upon in the case of an emergency. Access to this database would enable Federal, State, and local officials, as well as nongovernmental relief organizations, to locate quickly whatever technology or scientific help they might need from the private sector. For example, a city official tasked with setting up a command center in the wake of an emergency might need laptop computers and high capacity telecommunications equipment. A State health director facing a potential bioterrorism incident might need to locate experts with expertise concerning a specific pathogen and to obtain special detection and remediation technology as soon as possible. An emergency official coordinating in the field rescue and recovery efforts might need a batch of hand-held radios or might need to bring in mobile cellular units to expand local cellular coverage and capacity so people on the ground can communicate. In all of these instances, the key is locating equipment and expertise quickly. By turning to our virtual technology reserve, these officials would have a quick way to identify companies that have what they need and companies that have expressed their willingness to help in an emergency. The Wyden-Allen legislation has several other provisions that we believe will help make a meaningful difference in this fight against terrorism. The legislation provides for the formation of rapid response teams of science and technology experts. It establishes a clearinghouse and test bed for new antiterror technologies. Suffice it to say, our Government has received thousands and thousands of ideas, unsolicited, from private companies and citizens all across this country with respect to products to aid in the fight against terrorism. And there is no systematic way to evaluate the quality of those products. The bipartisan legislation we brought to the Senate today would provide that test bed and a plan to have those products evaluated. Finally, our legislation provides for pilot projects to help overcome a problem that seems incomprehensible in a communications center as advanced as the east coast of the United States. We saw on September 11 that first responders, people on the front lines, police and fire and others, were not able to communicate to each other. Before our subcommittee, we were told that on the east coast of the United States, arguably the most sophisticated communications center on the planet, there were firemen actually hand walking messages to their colleagues because all of the available communications systems--the hard-wire systems, the land lines, the cell lines--was down. So we badly need to have innovative work done in trying to make interoperable these communications systems that our first responders need. Our Subcommittee on Science, Technology, and Space found, as we analyzed the events of September 11, that the private sector was ready, willing, and able to contribute, but too often they were up against obstacles when they wanted to help. Some couldn't get proper credentials to access disaster sites. Some simply could not find the right place to offer their people their expertise and equipment and were literally knocking on doors offering to help, and people literally could use their skills. On December 5 of last year, FEMA Director Joe Allbaugh testified before our subcommittee that emergency response officials could have used the help of people in the technology sector to set up databases to track the missing and injured, as well as the goods and services being donated. But what Director Allbaugh has said--and he has been very helpful in this effort--was there simply wasn't a centralized go-to desk to provide experts for immediate needs. In the event of a bioterror attack, we have been told by the health authorities that communities would face the very same confusion. Right now, if a town is hit with a biological agent and local officials are looking for the closest medical authority, there is no comprehensive list of certified experts to help them. Suffice it to say, in our effort to try to come up with a coordinated plan to fight terrorism, there are going to be some difficult issues. I have great sympathy for Tom Ridge as he tries to bring together these agencies--perhaps 20 agencies--that are going to be involved in this effort. There are going to be some very difficult decisions that have to be made to maximize the talents and work of these agencies. But it seems to me the idea of having a preexisting database, so that in communities in Florida, and in Oregon, and across this country, if you are hit with a bioterror agent or have a calamity involving a terrorist attack, that you would have a preexisting database of individuals who can help and companies that are willing to donate equipment. That strikes me as eminently doable, something practical that the Government can do to make a real difference. That is why our virtual technology reserve and setting up these databases can make a real difference. In addition to that virtual technology reserve, the Wyden-Allen bill seeks to move experts into a community as rapidly as possible when problems arise. To that end, in our bill we provide for the creation and certification of national emergency technology guard teams. We call these teams NET guard teams. They would be made up of volunteers with technology and science expertise, and they would be organized in advance and available to be mobilized on short notice. After consulting at length with leaders in the Bush administration, we have decided that these unique teams ought to be modeled after the urban search and rescue teams that are now under FEMA and the medical response teams under the Department of Health and Human Services. But instead of providing search and rescue or medical services, which, of course, is what is available today, the NET guard teams would provide the technology, information, and communications support to help rescuers work more effectively. Once assembled, NET guard teams can provide technology-related help in the aftermath of floods, earthquakes, and other natural disasters as well. In the testimony Director Allbaugh gave to the subcommittee, we were told that the technology challenges that are facing crises such as the September 11 attacks are not just technology problems, they are problems that ultimately cost lives. The essence of this legislation is about saving lives, and one way it can do that is to establish a structure to form and activate what we call NET guard teams of technology experts who can step in when crises occur. We also think science and technology experts from the Nation's leading private sector companies have a role to play before disaster strikes. Clearly, we need to respond more effectively when there is a disaster. But it is only common sense to utilize the talents and energy of those in the private sector in a preventive way as well, and that is also a key feature of our bipartisan legislation. Since September 11, thousands of experts and entrepreneurs have contacted the Federal Government offering new technologies. We would like to have those evaluated.

I am going to focus my remarks this morning not so much on the specifics of the budget, as others will during the next several days, rather I will focus on the economic conditions that surround this debate. The distinguished Senator from Nebraska who a minute ago said he hoped that we Republicans would give President Clinton credit for good economic news, may be disappointed in what I have to say, because it certainly is not my intention to give the President high marks for what is happening in the economy. I ask people to reflect first on my very strong feelings about the Office of President of the United States, an office that all of us hold in high regard, when we think back across our history to some of the great leaders who have held that position. But today, as I discuss the economy, I find it difficult, frankly, to hold in high regard the comments made by the President of the United States with respect to what is happening with the economy, what is happening with growth, what is happening with opportunity. In his State of the Union Address this year, President Clinton said this is the strongest economy in three decades. Last year, fourth quarter to fourth quarter, the economy grew at an anemic 1.3 percent. Over the entire time that President Clinton has been in office, we have seen economic growth of only 2.4 percent a year. Compare that to the 10 years prior to President Clinton's administration, when economic growth in America averaged 3.4 percent a year. I do not believe this economy is something that we should brag about. Now, some economists cite statistics and say to us, ``Well, things are really kind of OK, not to worry.'' Let me tell you who I pay attention to. It may be all right for the President to pay attention to those economists and maybe try to hide behind the numbers--2.8 percent annual real growth in the first quarter of this year--while ignoring the fact that in 1995 we had only 1.3 percent real growth; or to say the unemployment rate is at 5.4 percent, while failing to say at the same time that there were no net jobs created in the private sector last month--none, zero. What does that mean? No opportunity. No opportunity to find a new job, no opportunity to leave one job to advance to another. No jobs created. When I want to know about the state of the economy, I pay attention to the people back home, people who come up to me and tell me they are worried about their future. In fact, it is interesting to ask people these days, how many of you believe that you are better off than your parents were at your age? Almost every hand in every audience goes up, agreeing that they are better off than the previous generation. But when you then ask how many believe their children will be better off when they are your age, maybe four or five hands go up. It appears that for the first time in a long, long time, we have a generation of Americans that thinks the next generation will not do as well as they have done. That is what is causing the tremendous anxiety that exists in America today. Still, President Clinton wants to claim the strongest economy in three decades--on the basis of 1.3 percent growth. It is interesting to remember that in 1992, when he was campaigning for the Presidency, he called the economy the worst in 50 years, even though the economy that year grew at 3.7 percent. It is a little difficult to understand the President's line of thinking: one day he talks about 3.7 percent growth as being a very weak economy, and then a few years later and he is President, and the economy is growing at only 1.3 percent, or even 2.4 percent, to say we have the strongest economy in three decades. It is very difficult for me, frankly, to give this administration, or this President, credit for a strong economy. I think we ought to, again, listen to what the people back home are saying to us. One example. I recently heard a story about a woman recalling that her husband had said to her on two separate occasions, ``You better not go out today. I may have to call and tell you to come pick me up, because I may not have a job when this day ends.'' I think about the mother telling her children she would not be home in the evening because she had to get a second job to make ends meet. One piece of statistical data that has not made the headlines is that, since January 1994, the number of individuals holding a second job has increased 17 percent. Now, the economists might tell working people not to worry. The President may tell working people not to worry, that everything is fine. But I can tell you that the people back home do not agree. They are very anxious about their future, and their ability to make ends meet. As a matter of fact, a recent poll asked, ``How worried are you about your ability to make ends meet?'' The response indicated that some 20 million American families a year say their ability to make ends meet is their No. 1 concern. Now there are 30 million families who are concerned about their ability to make ends meet. The anxiety question is real. Economists can say whatever they want, but the people in the State of Florida are concerned about the future. A couple of other statistics point to why people are feeling anxious. Real median family income has declined in 4 out of the last 5 years. And many other indicators suggest that trend will continue. Real compensation--that is, wages and benefits--grew only four-tenths of a percent in 1995, the slowest in 14 years. Between 1982 and 1989, real income per person grew three times as fast as it has since 1993, when President Clinton took office. The real issue before us is, how can we help create higher levels of growth? Should America be satisfied with 2.4 percent real growth, or worse? I say the answer is absolutely not. From the end of World War II to the beginning of the Clinton administration in 1993, economic growth averaged nearly 4 percent a year. Today, we are told we are doing well with growth of only 1.6 percent. Where are the jobs going to come from that will ensure prosperity and opportunity tomorrow? Not long ago, the President of the United States was in Florida, and there was debate over the future of the sugar industry in the Everglades. Protesters opposed to the administration's plan said they were going to lose their jobs. In essence, the President responded: ``Don't worry, we will see that anyone who loses their job will get another one.'' I wonder how many times he has made that comment around the country. But where does he think these jobs come from? Government doesn't create jobs. They come from the private sector, and they come as a result of Government getting out of the way and allowing for investment to take place. So we must begin this discussion, Mr. President, with the understanding that the economy is weak, not strong, that job creation has slowed. While the administration wants to brag about the 8.5 million jobs created since they came into office, they neglect to mention that if job formation took place at the same rate as in previous recoveries, there would have been 11.5 million jobs created in America, and we are really 3 million jobs short. Furthermore, of the 8.5 million jobs that have been created, many are second and part-time jobs going to families that need second jobs just to make ends meet. That does not make for a growing economy. I think it is also important that, when we debate the budget, we must remember who is paying the bills. I think about the people at home who come up and tell me about their tax burden, what they are being asked to pay for Government. I think of the young couple, the husband who works two jobs all week long, from early in the morning until late at night, five days a week, and then stays at home on Saturday and Sunday to take care of his little ones while their mom is out on her job over the weekend in order to make ends meet. I think about the couple that gets up at the crack of dawn and commutes long distances to work, and does not get home at night until well after dark, who cannot spend time with their kids, yet are being asked to pay more and more and more to the Federal Government. Do you know what really frustrates them? It is that they are being asked to work longer and harder to pay more taxes to support programs that they know have failed and to support individuals who are not working. That is the central theme that runs all through the debate. For example, with respect to the 4.3-cent rollback of the gasoline tax. Every time workers pull up to the gas pump, that 4.3 cents in gasoline taxes goes not to build more roads or to build more bridges, but to fund Federal programs they know have failed, and support people who refuse to work. That is why support for activities here in Washington, DC, has been so deeply undermined in America. So, Mr. President, I believe our debate should not be so much concerned about this budget itself, but about what needs to happen in order to spur growth of this country, and thereby provide more hope and opportunity for more Americans. Let me make one other point about productivity growth. Prior to the mid-1970's, productivity in America grew approximately 2.1 percent a year. In the last 10 years, that rate declined to about 1.1 percent. And now, during the 3 years of the Clinton administration, productivity growth has averaged only three-tenths of a percent. If productivity does not increase in a meaningful way, there is no way to pass on higher wages to employees. What is causing productivity to decline? More taxes, more spending, more Government, and less freedom, including taking away the freedom to pursue greater creativity, to spur American ingenuity, and to provide opportunity. With higher taxes, more regulation, and more interference from Washington, there is less opportunity for American business to be more productive, more competitive, and to create jobs. So, Mr. President, I say that, at this point, ","word.count":1890,"sep11":-5.46348314606742,"years":1996.39606741573,"days":497,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0347939106037936,"Topic 2":0.276468523550128,"Topic 3":0.0121006181076098,"Topic 4":0.0371059690344458,"Topic 5":0.00997615858651639,"Topic 6":0.010490148209198,"Topic 7":0.443679075022537,"Topic 8":0.0399347751522021,"Topic 9":0.127958078217732,"Topic 10":0.00749274351583709},{"id":"10820040068767","body":"Carl Levin: Mr. President, I voted for the Senate version of this FSC/ ETI legislation. While I had a number of misgivings about that bill, those were outweighed by my concerns over the crisis in our Nation's manufacturing sector and the sanctions being imposed as a result of the FSC/ETI regime. However, I will oppose this conference report. It fails to include too many of the important provisions from the Senate bill and has a number of added bad provisions. The Senate bill we passed in May did a lot to crack down on tax dodgers, but the House Republican leadership, with pressure from the administration, has refused to include most of these provisions in this legislation. While men and women in our military are putting their lives on the line every day for America, too many corporations are stiffing our country by dodging their taxes. They are depriving our country of funds needed to strengthen homeland security, support our troops, care for the sick, educate kids, and more. To make things fair for our U.S. manufacturers that play by the rules, we need to close loopholes that allow the tax dodging corporations to avoid paying their fair share. One of the most glaring of these omissions from this legislation is the provision passed by the Senate numerous times that would have required business transactions to have actual ``Economic Substance'' in order to receive tax benefits. Refusing to include this anti-abuse tool means that tax dodgers will still be able to escape paying their fair share by using phony transactions that have no business purpose other than tax avoidance. It also means we miss the opportunity to collect from these tax dodgers a much needed $15 billion over 10 years. Another distressing decision by the House Republicans is the slashing of the penalty imposed on those who design and peddle abusive tax shelters. These abusive shelters are undermining the integrity of our tax system, robbing the Treasury of tens of billions of dollars a year, and shifting the tax burden from high-income corporations and individuals onto the backs of the middle class. The amendment Senator Coleman and I offered, which became part of the Senate bill, set the penalty on an abusive tax shelter promoter at 100 percent of the fees earned from the abusive shelter. This penalty would have ensured that the abusive tax shelter hucksters would not get to keep a single penny of their ill-gotten gains. But that provision was cut in half in this conference report, setting the penalty at 50 percent of the fees earned, meaning the promoters of abusive shelters get to keep half of their gain. Why should anyone who pushes an illegal tax shelter that robs our Treasury of much needed revenues get to keep half of his ill-gotten gains? And what deterrent effect is created by a penalty that allows promoters to keep half of their fees if caught, and all of them if they are not? This half-hearted penalty is not tough enough to do the job that needs to be done. And this conference report completely leaves out yet another Senate provision that is critical in the fight against abusive tax shelters. In addition to those who are considered ``promoters'' of these abusive shelters, there are the professional firms--the law firms, banks, and investment advisors--that aid and abet the use of abusive tax shelters and enable taxpayers to carry out these abusive tax schemes. For example, a law firm is often asked to write an ``opinion letter'' to help taxpayers head off IRS questioning and fines that they might otherwise confront for using an abusive shelter. Under current law, these aiders and abetters face a penalty of only $1,000, or $10,000 if the offender is a corporation. This penalty is a joke. It provides no deterrent at all, when law firms are getting $50,000 for each of these cookie-cutter opinion letters. A $1,000 fine is like a parking ticket for raking in millions illegally. With the Levin-Coleman amendment, our Senate bill upped this fine to 100 percent of the gross income derived from the prohibited activity. Unfortunately, it appears the House conferees thought it was ok to let these aiders and abetters continue to profit handsomely from their wrongdoing instead attempting to deter this behavior that robs tens of billions of dollars from the U.S. Treasury. Another gaping tax loophole that this conference report weakened is the unfairness to the taxpayers that arises when companies renounce their citizenship, going through phony reincorporations by establishing a shell headquarters on paper in Bermuda or other tax-haven countries when, in reality, their primary offices and production or service facilities remain right here in the U.S. These corporate expatriates get all the benefits of being U.S. companies without contributing their fair share of the bill. The Senate FSC/ETI bill had a provision that would have shut down a significant portion of this loophole. I have long preferred an even stronger fix, such as the one Senator Reid of Nevada and I put forward in S. 384, the Corporate Patriot Enforcement Act of 2003. But at least the provision passed by the Senate went much further than the one before us. The provision included in the conference report lets all the companies that used this gimmick prior to March of 2003 continue to avoid the taxes that their American-based competitors face. The Senate version would have cracked down on these tax dodgers to the tune of more than $3.1 billion over 10 years while this weak provision raises only $830 million. It is shocking that the House Republican conferees were willing to leave $2.3 billion in dodged taxes on the table when that money could have gone to implement Senator Landrieu's amendment that would offer real help to our activated guardsmen and reservists. I understand that during the conference negotiations, the Senate conferees offered an amendment that would have reinstated many of these important curbs on tax dodges. The amendment would have raised an additional $40 billion over 10 years. But, once again the House GOP refused to accept these anti-abuse measures, and the amendment was defeated on a party line vote. The problems with this legislation are not limited to the fact that we are letting tax dodgers off way too easy. At a time when many corporations pay no tax at all and corporate tax revenues are at historic lows, this bill is full of special interest tax breaks. It also includes new tax benefits for the offshore operations of U.S. multinational companies, such as allowing companies with earnings held overseas to bring them back at a tax rate lower than the rate paid on domestic profits. The cost of these international provisions is estimated at $43 billion over 10 years, but this estimate is misleadingly low because some of these provisions are ``temporary'' or do not kick in until later years. While I support incentives to create and support U.S.-based manufacturing jobs, I am concerned that some of these international provisions will provide an incentive for companies to keep resources, facilities, and employees abroad, and subsidize the movement of jobs and resources overseas. Furthermore, while the official cost estimate of this bill says that it is essentially budget neutral over the next 10 years, this paints a deceptively optimistic picture. Throughout the measure there are many gimmicks to keep the numbers even, like phasing in some of the tax cuts and setting up others as ``temporary.'' According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, just extending the ``temporary'' provisions would reduce revenues by nearly $80 billion over the next 10 years. I am also troubled by the elimination of provisions pertaining to regulation of tobacco by the Food and Drug Administration, FDA. According to a recent report by the Surgeon General, tobacco consumption by America's youth is one of our country's leading health risks. The Senate passed strong bipartisan provisions that would deal with both the FDA and tobacco regulation: provisions that would give the FDA sweeping authority to prevent overt marketing of tobacco products to children under the age of 18; provisions that would allow the FDA to regulate prior approval of statements on tobacco products; and provisions that allow the FDA to restrict the sale, distribution and promotion of tobacco if they are deemed to be a danger to public health. These provisions are essential to protecting our children from the dangers of smoking, but the House conferees have killed any chance in the near future to give the FDA the tools it needs in this critical area. I am also troubled by the exclusion of Senator Harkin's overtime amendment that would keep essential overtime protections for middle class working Americans. And finally, it seems unfathomable that in this $137 billion bill the conference committee would leave out the Senate provision sponsored by Senator Landrieu that would have helped the large number of our activated Guardsmen and Reservists who face a reduction in their salaries during activation by assisting those civilian employers who continue to pay these employees after they have been called up. While this legislation includes some provisions which I support, overall it falls far short of the bill which the Senate sent to conference, and I cannot support it.","word.count":1542,"sep11":3.16292134831461,"years":2005.02247191011,"days":3568,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0302886420835823,"Topic 2":0.0866902666162045,"Topic 3":0.692190444922407,"Topic 4":0.0167378052443434,"Topic 5":0.0354945367964398,"Topic 6":0.00556384060584981,"Topic 7":0.0465653107074579,"Topic 8":0.0597755579609418,"Topic 9":0.0214471963412373,"Topic 10":0.00524639872153651},{"id":"10519980089302","body":"Bob Kerrey: Mr. President, I have some good news, and I have some bad news. First the good news: We won. The Cold War, that is. Now the bad news: We may find the burden of winning that war as heavy as the burden of fighting it. I say that is the ``bad news,'' Mr. President, because it seems like bad news. But I believe it is both our destiny--a mantle that history has placed on our shoulders whether we like it or not--and an opportunity. The opportunity is this: the furnace in which American values are forged throughout the world is fiery hot, and its door is open. That furnace will not be hot forever, Mr. President. Our triumph in the Cold War dissolved an empire and set free the nations that had been chained up by it. The totalitarian idea was stripped of the thin threads of legitimacy to which its aging adherents continued to cling. The birth of freedom--the opportunity to build new institutions of democracy and world stability--opened. This furnace was hot, and still is, Mr. President, but the opportunity to build from the rubble of a fallen empire also brings turmoil. As what we hope are the transitional problems of economic instability, ethnic conflict, and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction cool and harden into habits, the door to that furnace of opportunity is closing. America has learned before that the smoldering embers of victory contain the fires of reignited conflict. Once in this century we got it wrong. After the first world war, we made the fatal mistake of a vengeful peace. The result was a second world war, after which we got much more right, especially our leadership in rebuilding a crumbled world. Now, like then, we are weary of war's toll, but now, like then, we must bear the burden of leadership in victory. And we must do it while the furnace is hot and the opportunity right. That, Mr. President, is why I am concerned that the 105th Congress is preparing to adjourn with too much foreign policy business left unfinished. The challenges we face around the world are burdens not just for this Congress, but for this country, for every American. The bell of leadership will toll for all of us, and we should not be surprised when it does. I want to outline just a few places where we may hear that call. First, we face a global economic meltdown. Economies throughout the world are slowing and more uncertainty seems to arise everyday. Over the past year we have seen how instability in the Asian financial markets can quickly spread and undermine the stability of the global economy. The impact has been devastating. Overnight, people in Asia and Russia have seen their entire life savings disappear. They have seen the chance to give their children an education and a shot at a better life evaporate. They have seen their standards of living plummet to the point where they must struggle to acquire basic necessities. Failure to act quickly to reverse the situation and promote global economic growth could consign an entire generation--who only months ago were on the verge of building a middle class--to a life of continued poverty. We must know that global prosperity is not possible without a strong U.S. economy. I am pleased with the recent decision by the Federal Reserve to cut U.S. interest rates; although I admit I wish they would have cut it further. As the economic engine that drives the world, we must be prepared to take bold action to ensure world economic growth. Let me be clear, not only do we seek to improve the lives of people around the world through economic growth, we act with an element of self interest. A healthy global economy is the surest way to maintain a robust economy in the United States. As the farmers in my state know, without markets for U.S. products abroad, our own prosperity is threatened. Should this economic crisis deepen, should we start seeing credible signs of global depression, this Congress and the Administration must be prepared to act boldly to stimulate economic growth. In that regard, I am pleased we are taking a proactive role in trying to prevent the economic crisis from spreading further to places like Latin America. We should continue to work cooperatively with other nations, like Japan, to assist them in implementing the kind of economic and legal reforms that will help them rebuild their economies. Out of this crisis, we are also learning that economic instability leads to political instability. We see this in Russia, where financial shocks have created a political crisis which threatens Russian democracy. The situation in Russia demands our attention. As a nation with a capability to launch thousands of nuclear weapons, we cannot afford to allow Russia to slip into anarchy. I still believe the Russian transition will be successful, but it will be measured in decades, not years. We must be prepared to help the Russian people over the long run to create a democratic system based on the rule of law. At the same time, we cannot allow the wealth of challenges we face both at home and abroad to embolden despotic leaders to flaunt international standards. Recent missile tests by North Korea only too clearly demonstrate the need to remain committed to the security of our friends in Asia. It refocuses our attention on this troubled region. A divided Korea is one of the few lingering vestiges of the Cold War. But a change there is inevitable. I see two potential scenarios on the Korea Peninsula. In the first scenario, North Korea will acquiesce to the tide of history, renounce totalitarianism, embrace democracy, and peacefully reunite with the South. In the other scenario, North Korea implodes into an irrational and dangerous nation threatening the peace and security not only of South Korea, but of the entire region. While we should strive to ensure the former scenario, we should prepare for the latter. First, we should reaffirm our military ties with South Korea and Japan. The 37,000 American troops stationed in South Korea, and the tens of thousands stationed throughout Asia, should serve as ample warning of our intent to stand by our allies and respond to all threats. Second, we should continue to support South Korea as it rebuilds its economy and implements further democratic reforms. Finally, we must maintain our active containment of North Korea with the cooperation of all of our partners in the region. As we remain vigilant in Korea, we cannot release the pressure we have built on Saddam Hussein's regime. We are all concerned about Saddam's unwillingness to live up to his agreements, to fully disclose all information on his weapons of mass destruction programs, and to cooperate with United Nations Security Council Resolutions and mandates. Iraq's refusal to cooperate with UNSCOM monitors can not be allowed to go unchallenged. But ultimately, our success in Iraq will not come from winning a game of hide and seek with Saddam's weapons of mass destruction, but through the establishment of democracy in Iraq. We must change our policy from containment of Iraq to the replacement of Saddam Hussein with a democratic government. I am pleased legislation sponsored by Senator Lott and myself--designed to set the Iraqi people on the path to self- government--was recently passed by both the House and the Senate. As Americans, we should strive for no less. This policy is both noble, and with our assistance, possible. In the Balkans, recent election victories by Serbian hardliners in Bosnia once again raise concerns about the prospects for a lasting peace. While enormous progress has been made since the days of open warfare and ethnic cleansing, more must be done to assure that Bosnia will become a peaceful, multi-ethnic state. Let us be clear, the chance for peace in Bosnia did not come from a sudden willingness of the warring parties to come together. It came from our willingness to use our own military power.","word.count":1342,"sep11":-2.98314606741573,"years":1998.87640449438,"days":1380,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.39239898811854,"Topic 2":0.221843885750229,"Topic 3":0.00890608592664522,"Topic 4":0.294875340148699,"Topic 5":0.00766922257548344,"Topic 6":0.00540387589135479,"Topic 7":0.0119442655689479,"Topic 8":0.0117540578043996,"Topic 9":0.0393332308607391,"Topic 10":0.00587104735496155},{"id":"10519970017991","body":"Carrie Meek: Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Bass amendment and commend the gentleman.

It reduces the deficit over the next seven years by $961 billion, reduces spending, and at the end of that 7-year period, if you exclude Social Security, you have a balanced budget. It results in a significantly smaller Government. It gives us the potential of having lower taxes as well. I must say, Mr. President, again, I believe this is a solid and a good-faith effort. I regret, as I have listened to the debate [[Page S6899]] today, that it has been considerably less than the sort of civil debate that I would have thought was possible given some discussions that are going on right now between a number of us on the Democratic side that would like to participate in supporting this budget resolution. And I say that because what has happened is the dynamic has really changed. We are engaged in looking at an alternative that we I hope can get consideration to, I suspect sometime next week by the time it is all done. And we begin with somewhere in the neighborhood of $700 billion of cuts over a 7-year period. That is a substantial shift. The President's budget, as has been commented on several times, contains no significant deficit reduction. Suddenly, you have under the leadership of the distinguished Senator from New Mexico and the distinguished Senator from Nebraska, the ranking Democrat on the Budget Committee, a big shift in the Senate and I think large numbers, well in excess of 60, who would vote for a budget resolution that got us to a point 7 years from now where the deficit would be zero. I have come here this evening to identify a couple of problems, and I hope I identify the problems in a constructive fashion because, as I said, I would like very much and hope very much that the Republican chairman and Republican leadership will favorably view, as I said, a significant number of us who would like to participate in voting for a resolution that does approximately what the distinguished Senator from New Mexico is attempting to accomplish. Let me say for those who doubt the power of deficit reduction, the most impressive number in all of the 7-year forecast is that net interest stays the same. Net interest has been the most rapidly growing line in our entire budget, and under the budget resolution before us net interest would flatten out. As an expenditure, Mr. President, it certainly benefits bond holders, but it does not benefit American taxpayers at all. It is a payment that goes out, that buys us nothing other than the capacity to service these bonds. It is the most impressive number and one that I think we should pay attention to as we look to try to develop some alternatives. I begin in describing some concerns that I have about this sort of evaluating its impact upon me. Earlier today, I heard the distinguished senior Senator from Iowa talking about the fact that this budget resolution freezes congressional salary over, I believe, a 7-year life of the budget. I am impressed that that is in this budget resolution, but, Mr. President, I do not really feel for someone in the $136,000 or whatever it is plus salary that is a comparable shared sacrifice. I am not one who comes to this floor and says that the problem in America is that rich people are somehow manipulating and abusing poor Americans. I do not believe that at all. But I do believe if we are going to have $1 trillion worth of deficit reduction over a 7-year period, it should be shared sacrifice, and it is reasonable to look at some alternatives, whether it is capping the deductions at 28 percent, which the Entitlement Commission recommended would get $80 billion or $90 billion over a 7-year period, or have me and others with incomes over $100,000 having to pay a little bit as a consequence. Some would come up and say, oh, gee, that is a big tax increase. I do not view it that way at all. It is just an attempt to say we ought to pay a little bit in order to get this thing to go away. It is not, Mr. President, just because there is a need for shared sacrifice, at least from my standpoint. It is also a consequence of coming and saying I am a little bit troubled, looking at some of the things that we are asking Americans to do because it seems to me, at least from my standpoint, I as one individual American am saying, well, gosh, now that I have mine, I want everybody else to do things that I did not have to do when I was in trouble or needed help. I have perhaps more than most kind of a schizophrenic attitude toward government. I have had it save my life. I have had it save my business. I have had it almost take my life and almost take my business. It can do both, Mr. President, but I have to say in the main, if I look at the 51 years of my lifetime the Government of the United States of America, though it can be a menace from time to time, has enable me to do an enormous amount. Yes, individual initiative is important and my family has been important and my friends have been important, but there are many key points along my lifetime, Mr. President, where I have been given a great deal of help and I have been given opportunity in education, been given opportunity in health care, been given opportunity in my own business, and I cannot in good conscience come to the floor and say that as a consequence of my own experience I feel that I am participating very much in the shared sacrifice needed, that we are all conscious of what is needed in order to get this deficit eliminated. So I begin with that, Mr. President. I hope again that the Republican leadership and the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee will look to those of us who intend, if we can, to reach agreement, which is not easy to do. If we get an alternative, I hope it is given good, solid consideration. I hope the chairman of the Budget Committee will say that this is a big victory; we started off the year, nobody believing we could get much in the way of deficit reduction, Democrats really not very enthusiastic about it, according to at least what you would read, and now all of a sudden we have Democrats moving a long ways in our direction willing to accept--I think we will end up with close to $700 billion over 7 years in real cuts, asking only that we look to ways for all of us to share a little bit in this thing over the course of the budget. There is a second problem, Mr. President. I do not know if it can be done in this budget resolution. I recognize the constraints of the Budget Committee and the Budget Enforcement Act really does not perhaps allow the Budget Committee to deal with these issues and maybe it has to be dealt with later on in the year. Earlier, the senior Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Simpson] commented upon it. But the Entitlement Commission--and I have heard a number of people talk about it--has identified what I think is a serious problem. I am actually borrowing a chart from Senator Bennett, the Senator from Utah, who had this chart up. But this really does describe the problem that the Entitlement Commission identified which is that mandatory spending and net interest are growing so rapidly that sometime around the year 2012, something like that, it is consuming all revenue that the Government of the United States is taking in. That revenue has stayed relatively flat. It is about the only thing that has stayed constant. We have collected about 19 percent of the GDP except in World War II and Vietnam; during those times it went higher. Most of the time it stayed about 19 percent. And unless we change that pattern of growth what happens is domestic discretionary continues to get squeezed down. I appreciate the fact that Social Security was not addressed or retirement not really addressed in this budget resolution. I think it needs to be, not because there is a short-term budget problem. I am not arguing that we ought to look at retirement because it contributes to deficit reduction in the short term. But it unquestionably contributes to deficit reduction in the long term. That is the problem we have. Some may say, gee, that will be good news, if we can get rid of all Government functions and turn the Federal Government into an ATM machine. I do not think that is good news. I believe not just in defense but as I hope I indicated earlier all of those things that have helped me have been in the domestic discretionary account. Everything I have received from the Government has come from domestic discretionary, unless you count the U.S. Navy, which was an enormous benefit to me as well. I leave out the world's largest and most powerful Navy. That was a wonderful experience, too. All of the rest I have benefited from have come from this domestic account. I am troubled by the budget resolution because it allows that mandatory account to continue to grow. It slows it down somewhat, but the mandatory accounts continue to grow and continue to take larger and larger percentages of domestic discretionary. It must be understood the budget resolution improves the current trend, makes it somewhat better, but I do not believe-- [[Page S6900]] and I must say honestly I have not extended it out beyond the 7 years, so I do not know exactly what it looks like out there 10, 15, 20, 30 years from now but looking at the 1996 and 2002 trend line, that appears to be the case. For emphasis, the one big change that has occurred is that net interest has flattened out, and that is a huge benefit to us. So to solve this problem of mandatory spending, we have to look at the long-term situation, not the short term. That is why I say it maybe that the Budget Committee, in looking at a budget resolution that deals with a 7-year period of time, may not have been able to address this mandatory problem.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 1294, to recognize the goals of National Save for Retirement Week. I am pleased to join my colleague from Pennsylvania, Representative Allyson Schwartz, to again introduce a resolution in support of National Save for Retirement Week. The week is designated this year as October 19-25. You know the best time for Americans to save is on payday. That is when they have got the cash. When employees save through their employer-based retirement plan, the money comes out of their paycheck before other tempting priorities get in the way. Saving for numero uno ought to be every working American's top priority before spending on optional things like dinner, movies, or, I hope today, still buying a shiny new car. Saving for retirement is not as flashy or fun as many competing priorities, but the only way most of us are ever going to be able to afford retirement in the future is by saving today. This spring, the Employee Benefit Research Institute released its annual retirement confidence survey that shows Americans' confidence in their ability to afford a comfortable retirement has dropped to its lowest level in several years. This drop in confidence represents several concerns, but the big concerns I hear about are the overall state of the economy, the weak stock market and concern about one's own job security. The answer to these concerns, in my opinion, is to save in an employer-based retirement plan. The first reason is that most employers match the employee contributions. If an employee puts 1 percent of earnings into a plan, many employers match that contribution dollar for dollar. That means the employee gets a 100 percent rate of return. Even if the market slides a little bit, the employee still comes out ahead because of the company match. Many employers match even more generously, up to 4 or 6 percent of salary. When an employer is handing out free money, I encourage all employees to get in line and let's say ``yes.'' A second reason to save at work is our economy is going to recover soon and employees can look at their current stock market purchases as buying low. The formal term for regular purchases in the stock market is dollar cost averaging. That means you purchase mutual funds or stocks at regular intervals, such as on payday, regardless of share price. Under dollar cost averaging, when the market prices are low, you end up buying more shares with a set amount of money, and when market prices are high you buy fewer shares with your set amount of dollars. Buy low, sell high. It works every time to build wealth. The third reason to participate in an employer-based retirement plan is that the sooner people save money, the sooner the most powerful force on Earth can work for them, the power of compound interest. With an average of 8 percent return, money doubles every 9 years. The cost of living in the future, even in retirement, is not going to go down, but money saved early in one's work life will make retirement easier. Another powerful force in saving is inertia, sometimes described as a body at rest stays at rest, or a body in motion stays in motion. Employers and Congress recognize that principles of inertia often means that employees never get around to affirmatively signing up for retirement plans at work. To address inertia, Congress passed a law to allow employers to automatically enroll employees in retirement plans and get those savings rolling forward with the power of compound interest. The amazing thing is we are now seeing roughly 90 percent employer participation in retirement plans with an automatic enrollment, up from previous levels of roughly 70 percent. I am glad to see this new law is working. Last year, after we enacted a similar resolution, I was happy to see reports about the number of employers that promoted National Save for Retirement Week. There were lots of employee benefit fairs, promotional enrollment meetings and seminars, and other employers printed up new brochures for employees to review regarding the importance of retirement savings. I hope to work with more employers in my congressional district this year to bring the message of Save for Retirement Week to employees. Mr. Speaker, I know that Americans are strapped for cash and that right now saving is a hard thing to do. Rising gas prices are taking bigger and bigger bites out of everyone's income. It is hard to set aside retirement money for years down the road. It feels like right now there is a lot of month left at the end of every paycheck. But Americans don't want to work forever, and the only way to retire is to plan and save. I would encourage everyone to go to the Web site choosetosave.org and use any of the calculators that help to plan for retirement, college savings, and budgeting in general. Planning is a great first step to financial security. Mr. Speaker, we know that Americans who have only Social Security as retirement income end up in poverty. As much as some of my colleagues hate to admit it, Social Security has a serious funding problem in a relatively short time and we need to address the problem. We can't just tax our way out of that problem either. Part of the reason for our horrible national savings rate is that Americans are paying a whopping 15 percent of salary between their individual share and their employer's share in payroll taxes. In 1984, when payroll taxes went up dramatically by 5 percent, the national savings rate fell by the same amount. Congress took those payroll taxes out of Americans' pockets in order to fund Social Security and Medicare, with the promise that the programs would always be there to pay benefits in the future. The problem is our programs face huge structural deficits, and Americans have not been saving. We need to change a lot of things, but the first thing we can do is get people to start saving. Americans need to save at work where they generally get a match from their employer and where the money goes down to their own retirement accounts before expenses get in the way. I look forward to working with employers and financial institutions in my Dallas and Collin County representation areas later this year to promote National Save for Retirement Week, which will happen the week of 19 October through 25 October. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Allyson for introducing this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.","word.count":1122,"sep11":6.96067415730337,"years":2008.8202247191,"days":4920,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.00818637631756877,"Topic 2":0.0101802761541772,"Topic 3":0.00339745842422998,"Topic 4":0.00285581115599151,"Topic 5":0.00486287279250677,"Topic 6":0.0100921926320034,"Topic 7":0.487554919248194,"Topic 8":0.223307695789969,"Topic 9":0.245049658307482,"Topic 10":0.00451273917787719},{"id":"11020080008223","body":"Tim Holden: I would just like to thank the ranking member for his comments and also to say to my friend from Wisconsin, who served on the committee, that he understands that we are fortunate to serve on one of the most bipartisan committees in the Congress.

Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank the gentleman from Utah , my colleague, for his assistance with this legislation. I introduced the bill last year at the request of the commissioners of Clear Creek County. The bill amends section 5 of the Clear Creek Land Transfer Act of 1993. The effect of the amendment would be to allow Clear Creek County additional time to determine the future disposition of some former Federal land that was transferred to the county under that section of the 1993 act. The 1993 act was originally proposed by my predecessor, Representative David Skaggs. Its purpose was to clarify Federal land ownership questions in Clear Creek County while helping to complete consolidation of the Bureau of Land Management administration in eastern Colorado and assisting with protecting open space and preserving historic sites. As part of its plan to merge its eastern Colorado operations into one administrative office, the BLM has determined that it would be best to dispose of most of its surface lands in northeastern Colorado. The 1993 act helped achieve that goal by transferring some 14,000 acres of land from the Bureau of Land Management to the U.S. Forest Service to the State of Colorado to Clear Creek County and to the towns of Georgetown and Silver Plume. Of course, the BLM could have sold all of these lands and the local governments could have applied for parcels under the Recreation and Public Purposes Act. Under current law, however, the BLM would first have had to complete detailed boundary surveys. Since lands in question included many small, d-shaped parcels, some measured literally in inches, the BLM estimated that boundary surveys would have taken at least another 15 years to complete and could have cost as much as $18 million. The estimated market value of these lands was only $3 million, and because the administrative costs were expected to be so much higher than the value of these lands, their disposal under existing law probably could never have been completed. And this would have been the worst of all outcomes because, after reaching the conclusion that the land should be transferred, the BLM in effect stopped managing them to the extent that they could have been managed at all. Until some means could be found to enable their transfer, these 14,000 acres were effectively abandoned property, potentially attracting all the problems which befall property left uncared for and ignored. The 1993 act responded to that situation. Under it, about 3,500 acres of BLM land in Clear Creek County were transferred to the Arapaho National Forest. About 3,200 acres of land transferred to the State of Colorado, the county and the towns of Georgetown and Silver Plume. Finally, about 7,300 acres were transferred to the county. The bill before us today deals only with those lands transferred to the county. The 1993 act provides that after it prepares a comprehensive land use plan, the county may resale some of the land. Other parcels will be transferred to local governments, including the county, to be retained for recreation and public purposes. With regard to the lands that the county has authority to sell, the 1993 act in effect authorizes the county to act as the BLM sales agent. It provides the Federal Government will receive any of the net receipts from the sale of these lands by the county. Under the 1993 act, the county has 10 years within which to resolve questions related to the rights of way, mining claims and trespass situations on the lands covered by that section of the act, and then to decide which parcels to transfer and which to retain. Among other things, the county is working with the Colorado Division of Wildlife on a proposal that will result in some 2,000 acres being transferred to the division of wildlife and management as big horn sheep habitat. While the county has completed the conveyance of some of these lands, they still have about 6,000 acres to dispose of. The county commissioners have informed me that the process is taking longer than they anticipated and that a 10-year extension of time would be helpful to them to complete the process. The bill that the House is considering today responds to that request by providing that extension. I urge its adoption, and I attach a letter from the commissioners of Clear Creek County explaining the request for this legislation.","word.count":785,"sep11":-1.00561797752809,"years":2000.85393258427,"days":2084,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.360460909587127,"Topic 2":0.11920970702397,"Topic 3":0.0266128279304404,"Topic 4":0.0239821312773809,"Topic 5":0.0096532160414407,"Topic 6":0.0113208703618454,"Topic 7":0.0146639042994494,"Topic 8":0.0273261372139848,"Topic 9":0.397847041492213,"Topic 10":0.00892325477214889},{"id":"10820040023634","body":"Philip English: Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume I am pleased to bring House Resolution 705 before the House today. It was introduced last week and it is being brought forward with considerable urgency because, Mr. Speaker, while this may not be the first time that we have discussed the issue of competitive trade disadvantage on the floor of the House that U.S. companies are facing, this may be the time that we are most clearly focusing on the contribution to that problem created by the American tax system. The fact that our trade deficit is more than $500 billion demonstrates that the economic engine of American exports has experienced a slowdown. In order for us to revive our economy and to have long-term growth, the substantial trade imbalance that we now are experiencing, 5 percent of our economy, representing our trade deficit, has to be corrected. Mr. Speaker, Congress and the administration need to push our trading partners to adjust the rules to level the playing field for American workers and American companies; and today's resolution helps do that by focusing on the disadvantage actually built into the World Trade Organization rules, a disadvantage imposed upon our Tax Code, allowing our competitors what amounts to a $120 billion advantage over American companies. For the past 30 years, the WTO has said that, while the EU members and other trading partners can and do exempt from tax their exports to the U.S., we must fully tax our exports to them. As our manufacturers and other critical industries begin to recover from the recession, it is imperative that we address this inequity. Otherwise, we risk undermining one of the key drivers of economic growth, our export sector, and we also put at risk those companies that are competing within our domestic market by fostering upon them a significant competitive disadvantage. Right now, WTO rules recognize the U.S. corporate income tax to be a so-called direct tax. Under the WTO rules, so-called ``indirect taxes,'' value-added tax or retail sales tax or any other consumption- type tax, can be rebated on exports going out from the home country and imposed on imports coming in from foreign countries, but such adjustments cannot be made for direct taxes when goods and services cross international borders. This is a distinction that has no grounding in economic reality and simply puts us at a competitive disadvantage. It is a crucial inequity for U.S. taxpayers and producers. Confronting it head on will go a long way to boost American competitiveness in the global market. That is why the resolution before us declares that this distinction is arbitrary and it results in a competitive disadvantage for businesses and works with a border-adjustable system, such as all value-added tax systems. Looking to the future, this resolution should serve as a roadmap for reforming our international tax rules to allow U.S. products to compete in the global marketplace. This should be done in a way that exports American goods and services, not American jobs. The resolution asks the President to report to Congress on two matters within 120 days of the convening of the 109th Congress. As required by the Trade Act of 2002, the United States Trade Representative is charged with considering how to eliminate trade barriers put up by the U.S.'s direct tax system in pursuing trade negotiations. Thus, first, the resolution asks for the President to provide a progress report on these barriers and how they can be eliminated. Second, it resolves that the President should report on proposed alternatives to the disparate treatment of the direct/indirect distinction as well as domestic proposals redressing the taxes disadvantage to the U.S. Under the resolution, the President is asked to consider the impact of reducing the corporate rate, of implementing a territorial tax system, as well as the impact of a border-adjustable system as already allowed under the WTO rules. A comprehensive report on the issues would be an enormous help to the Congress and to any administration in putting into bold relief the improvements needed to international tax rules as well as our tax system as it stacks up against the systems of the rest of the world. The reason we must look at this issue more deeply is because it impacts on our economy in such a fundamental way. While we are certainly in a period of robust economic recovery, there is more we can do to sustain long-term growth. As evidenced by the $550 billion trade deficit I referenced earlier, we have become a Nation of importers. We need once again become a Nation of exporters; and as a Nation of exporters, we would see a thriving job market and a thriving manufacturing sector. In the absence of some kind of border tax adjustments for exports of American-made goods to correspond to the export rebates under VAT systems, there will continue to be a disincentive to produce goods in the United States. In effect, our tax system is creating all of the incentives to send our good-paying jobs offshore. This must be corrected, and this resolution is a step in the right direction. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.","word.count":868,"sep11":2.91292134831461,"years":2004.77247191011,"days":3479,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.336282594034557,"Topic 2":0.029869234173461,"Topic 3":0.0213613070915232,"Topic 4":0.0213184127721924,"Topic 5":0.00530528933944672,"Topic 6":0.307084852295001,"Topic 7":0.0046997734653125,"Topic 8":0.192572726158226,"Topic 9":0.0713353495625148,"Topic 10":0.0101704611077649},{"id":"10720010057792","body":"Tom Daschle: Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong support for the convincing call to action against Iraq that President Bush issued yesterday at the United Nations to discuss the unique dangers created by Saddam Hussein's regime and to argue that it is imperative that the international community, led by the United States of America, mobilize now to eliminate those dangers. On September 11, 2001, a foreboding new chapter in American history began. On that day, our Government was reawakened in this new century to its oldest and most solemn responsibility: protecting the lives and liberty of the American people. As we survey the landscape of threats to our security in the years ahead, the greatest are terrorists--al-Qaida and rogue regimes such as Saddam Hussein's. Saddam hates America and Americans and is working furiously to accumulate deadly weapons of mass destruction and the missiles, planes, and unmanned aerial vehicles to use in attacking distant targets. Every day Saddam remains in power is a day of danger for the Iraqi people, for Iraq's neighbors, for the American people, and for the world. As long as Saddam remains in power, there will be no genuine security and no lasting peace in the Middle East, among the Arab nations or among the Arabs, Israelis, and Christians who live there. The threat Saddam poses has been articulated so often that some may have grown numb to the reality of his brutality. But after September 11, we must reacquaint ourselves with him because if we do not understand and act, his next victims, like Osama bin Laden's, could be innocent Americans. President Bush advanced that process with great effectiveness in his speech at the U.N. yesterday, albeit after a season long on the beating of drums of war and short on explaining why war may now be necessary. But the President did that yesterday in New York. Now we, in Congress, must go forward together with him as the Constitution's competing clauses require us to do. Each of us must decide what actions will best advance America's values and secure the future of the American people. The essential facts are known. We know of the weapons in Saddam's possession--chemical, biological, and nuclear in time. We know of his unequaled willingness to use them. We know his history, his invasions of his neighbors, his dreams of achieving hegemonic control over the Arab world, his record of anti-American rage, his willingness to terrorize, to slaughter, to suppress his own people and others. And we need not stretch to imagine nightmare scenarios in which Saddam makes common cause with the terrorists who want to kill Americans and destroy our way of life. Indeed, 2 days ago on September 11, 2002, the state-owned newspaper in Iraq showed a picture of the World Trade Center's Twin Towers in flames with the headline ``God's Punishment.'' This man--Saddam Hussein--is a menace to the people and the peace of the world. It was his brutal invasion of his peaceful neighbor, Kuwait, in August 1990 that first and finally convinced America and the world that Saddam had become a tyrant, like so many before him in world history, who had to be stopped before he did terrible damage to his people, his region, and the wider world. I was privileged in January of 1991 to join with my colleague from Virginia, Senator John Warner, in sponsoring the Senate resolution that authorized the first President Bush to go to war against Saddam. The American military fought bravely and brilliantly, in that conflict and won an extraordinary victory in rolling back Saddam's invasion of Kuwait. But we did not achieve total victory. On April 9, 1991, I came to the Senate floor and expressed my disappointment that our forces in Desert Storm had not been authorized to remove Saddam from power, while his military was in disarray. I said then: ``The United States must pursue final victory over Saddam. We must use all reasonable diplomatic, economic, and military means to achieve his removal from power. Until that end is realized, the peace and stability of the region will not have been fully accomplished.'' In 1997 and 1998, I joined with Senators Bob Kerrey, Trent Lott, and John McCain to introduce the Iraq Liberation Act, which established in law for the first time that it is U.S. policy to change the regime in Baghdad, not just contain it, and authorized specific assistance, including military training and equipment, to the Iraqi opposition in furtherance of that goal. That declaration was based on Saddam's record of barbarism before, during and after the gulf war, and his repeated violations of U.N. resolutions. On November 13, 1998, after Saddam ejected the U.N. weapons inspectors, I said, ``If we let him block the inspections and the monitoring that he agreed to as a condition of the cease-fire in the gulf war, then there is no doubt that one day soon, he will use weapons of mass destruction, carried by ballistic missiles, against Americans in the Middle East or against our allies.'' Since then, months and years have passed and the danger from Baghdad has only grown greater. International pressure--legal, diplomatic, economic, and political--has failed to change Saddam's behavior. Growing stockpiles of Iraqi weapons, toxins, and delivery systems have accumulated. So too has a growing pile of U.N. resolutions which Saddam has persistently defied. They testify to the repeated opportunities the international community has given him to prove he has changed and to his determination nonetheless to remain a recidivist international outlaw. As President Bush made clear yesterday, this must end. The hour of truth and decision has arrived. This is Saddam's last chance, and the United Nations' best chance to show that its declarations of international law stand for something more than the paper on which they are written. It is time for all nations, law abiding and peace loving, to make clear that, after September 11, the world will not hesitate or equivocate while a tyrant stocks his arsenal and builds alliances with terrorists. I am grateful that President Bush has effectively begun the critical work of educating the American people, the Congress, and the world about why. Our cause is just. The facts are on our side. ``Making this case'' is not a burden. It is the vital responsibility of a democracy's leaders when they have decided that our Nation's security may necessitate war. It is an extraordinary opportunity, as well, to engage our allies in meeting the greatest security threat of our generation before it is too late--not just for us but for them. An opportunity to make the consequences of repeated defiance of the United Nations painfully clear to Iraq, and to any other government that might follow in its criminal path. An opportunity to show the world's law-abiding, peace-loving Muslim majority--who share the same values we do, the same aspirations we have for our families, and, I might add, the same extremist foes-- that as we oppose tyranny and terror, we will actively support them in their fight for freedom and a better life. President Bush has acted wisely and decisively in asking the United Nations to lead this noble effort, to insist that Iraq obey its resolutions, and to be prepared to enforce them militarily if Iraq does not comply. But if Saddam does not comply, and the United Nations proves itself unwilling or unable to take decisive action, then the United States surely can and must assemble and lead an international military coalition to enforce the United Nations resolutions and liberate the Iraqi people, the Middle East and the world from Saddam Hussein. If we lead, I am confident many other nations will come to our side. For more than 11 years now, since the early spring of 1991, I have supported the use of military force to disarm Iraq and to remove Saddam Hussein from power. In fact, since the Iraq Liberation Act was passed by Congress and signed by President Clinton in 1998, that has been the law of our land. Therefore, I am fully supportive of such military action now. I know that many of my colleagues in the Senate believe thoughtfully and sincerely that it would be preferable to give support to the President in two stages, first to endorse yesterday's call for U.N action, and then to return later, if the U.N. does not act, to authorize the use of America's military power against Iraq. Other Members of the Senate are understandably concerned that a debate on the question of war against Iraq may be unnecessarily politicized if it occurs in the more heated environment of this fall's congressional elections. But the White House has made it clear it will ask for a resolution of support and authorization in the very near future. Each member of the Senate must, and I am confident will, face that reality in a spirit of non-partisanship, going where their hearts and heads take them, in deciding how best to fulfill our Constitutional responsibility to provide for the common defense in the current circumstances. For my part, I intend to work with Members of both parties in the Senate with the White House to draft a Senate resolution that will receive the broadest possible bipartisan support for the President, as Commander in Chief, as he works to protect our Nation and the world from Saddam Hussein. On October 22, 1962, as nuclear weapons were being amassed in Cuba, President, Kennedy spoke to the Nation and warned Americans of the need to act in the face of the rising threat. President Kennedy's courageous and eloquent words can guide us now. He said on that occasion. I yield the floor.","word.count":133,"sep11":-0.210674157303371,"years":2001.64887640449,"days":2367,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.323239432629851,"Topic 2":0.0627228554163903,"Topic 3":0.0998808973819278,"Topic 4":0.435359492670111,"Topic 5":0.027554301720087,"Topic 6":0.00534653413149121,"Topic 7":0.00304630493589712,"Topic 8":0.034388710071347,"Topic 9":0.00375365872303808,"Topic 10":0.00470781231985993},{"id":"10720020049096","body":"Jeff Sessions: Mr. President, I rise to discuss a few items. The inflation index is an index that is in all of our budgetary projections. We figure out how our budget is going to be. When that index altered, it did free up some money previously committed to inflationary cost increases. It left that money available. I point out that in our Armed Services Committee, as we discussed this, we did not hear, when the budget passed, that we had to have more money for homeland defense or any particular item that amendments were offered on and voted down. It was only after this index became altered and funds were freed up. The President said: I will accept what the Senate Democrats offered in the Armed Services Committee for extra spending. He said: The money they took from missile defense--that he requested and was spent on other items that they wanted--I will allow that to go. I suggest we use this extra money so I can complete my projections for national missile defense. That is where we are today. Hopefully, we will be able to work through this and be happy with it. But I think we will have that inflation index money. I think it will be available. There is strong bipartisan support in this country for developing a national missile defense program and keeping it on track. The House passed their Defense authorization bill recently. They increased the President's request for national missile defense by $21 million. The House bill passed by a huge margin, 359 to 58. It is a totally bipartisan bill. Liberals, Conservatives, Democrats, and Republicans supported it. It had more in it for national missile defense than the President is asking for or that Senator Warner has asked for. I suggest that before we get real pure about spending money for a critical national need such as national missile defense, and developing this program, that we ask ourselves what we did a few weeks ago when the President asked for a $28 billion fiscal year 2002 emergency supplemental for homeland defense and the war on terrorism. Members of the body have increased that supplemental to $32 billion and it has all kind of pork and special interest items in it. So I do not know where we are going to go on that supplemental, but the President is very concerned about this additional spending and pork that went into that. Those are just some comments I wanted to make. I believe we are on track to maintain the steady development of national missile defense. It is something I support. I point out, with regard to the threat, that threats are not exclusive. In our Armed Services Committee, which Senator Levin chairs so ably, the Director of CIA, George Tenet, testified that we don't have the luxury of choosing between threats. He noted that missile defense threats have sometimes developed more rapidly than the intelligence community has predicted. And, indeed, the Rumsfeld commission, in 1999, unanimously concluded that missile programs of some of the rogue nations, and some other nations hostile to the United States, were developing far faster than had previously been predicted. Then there is this question about the money that is building up in to the counter-terrorism account. There is some $10 billion available for missile defense in the year 2003 if the bill is approved as is. But I think to do so would really be creative bookkeeping. The new budget authority for missile defense in this bill is $6.8 billion. That is $1 billion less than was appropriated last year. And the President proposed a modest reduction this year. There is another $814.3 million by the committee. That is a big cut by any standard. Senator Reed gets his $10 billion figure by mixing apples and oranges or, precisely, old fiscal year 2002 funding and new fiscal year 2003 funding. All funding for the Missile Defense Agency is for research and development. Research and development is what we are funding. R&amp;D funding is available for obligations for 2 years and for expenditures over 5 years. That is the way we do it. We do not give money for research and development and say you have to spend it all this year, ready or not. That is by design because R&amp;D projects, by their nature, require some flexibility in execution and stability in funding and planning. If Senators disagree with that, we can take away that extended availability of funds. But most Senators, I suspect, would say that the flexibility in execution and stability in funding and planning is a good thing. I think that is the way we need to continue to proceed. I yield the floor.","word.count":785,"sep11":0.808988764044944,"years":2002.66853932584,"days":2730,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.520967765322688,"Topic 2":0.0329400804727686,"Topic 3":0.0109966597765084,"Topic 4":0.0804033286194784,"Topic 5":0.00696074315330165,"Topic 6":0.153003877194871,"Topic 7":0.00813861235865822,"Topic 8":0.141707191671426,"Topic 9":0.039735130708216,"Topic 10":0.00514661072208393},{"id":"10519970068139","body":"Frank Murkowski: Mr. President, I will make some comments on the defense bill that we are considering. This defense authorization bill, as reported by the Armed Services Committee, contains essential elements to ensure that our military men and women and the equipment that we have are prepared to respond when and if needed for our national security. Funds are included in the bill that continue to modernize the force and continue to improve the quality of life for our military personnel and families. The bill remains within the limits of last year's budget agreement. It cuts spending by about 1 percent in real terms from last year. The committee approved a budget of $270.6 billion in budget authority. The bill represents a number of very difficult choices--choices that we had to make when we proposed increases in funding for the programs that the committee wanted to increase. For every dollar of increase, of course, we had to find funds elsewhere and, accordingly, there are some cuts in the budget that came from the administration. There are a few significant departures from funding levels in programs that were in the budget last year. In my view, it is a more ``responsible'' budget than we have had here on the Senate floor in several years with regard to our defense spending. That said, the relative stability in the bill can be a good thing. It can also prevent us from moving swiftly in important directions that require a timely response. I want to speak to some of those in a moment. At its best, the bill takes good care of the military personnel and their families. It contains a 3.1 percent pay raise, effective January 1, and three health care demonstration projects for retired military personnel, who are over 65, and for their families. These projects are designed to meet the concerns voiced by retirees who have served their country and seek equitable and quality health care services. There is a provision to enhance cooperation between the Veterans' Administration and the Department of Defense in providing health care to dual-eligible beneficiaries. There is a continuation of pilot and nuclear personnel bonuses and increased limits on certain bonuses to enhance recruitment and retention. There is increased funding for construction and upgrades of family housing. There are provisions to make it easier for military families to move when they are required to move. For my home State of New Mexico, the bill includes significant funding for our military bases and our National Laboratories that will benefit not only my State but the Nation. It includes funds for the High Energy Laser Test Facility and the Tactical High Energy Laser Program at White Sands Missile Range. It includes funding for the high- tech research being conducted at Phillips Laboratory in Albuquerque. It includes substantial funding for the defense programs at Los Alamos and Sandia to support their work in the stockpile stewardship program, nonproliferation research and development, and nuclear security assistance programs. It includes funds for military construction projects that we have been seeking--a new support facility for National Guard in Taos, NM, refurbishment of facilities and new family housing at Kirtland Air Force Base, a new war readiness facility at Holloman Air Force Base, and a badly needed runway repair project at Cannon Air Force Base. Mr. President, for all the good things that this bill provides for our military personnel and to the facilities in my State and to the Nation, there are still some aspects of the bill that I find troubling. The bill continues to place relatively greater emphasis on programs that address potential, rather than actual, long-term threats for which there is no current deployment requirement. Increased spending in those areas has come at the expense of programs designed to meet near-term threats which are actual and for which validated requirements exist. For example, the bill contains $1.1 billion for strategic missile defense programs, including national missile defense and space-based laser programs; that is an increase of $100 million over the President's request. That $1.1 billion is compared to $675 million for programs designed to reduce the threat of proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. The committee approved cuts in funding to proliferation prevention programs at a time when India's actions, and now Pakistan's actions, remind us of the immediacy of such threats. Information provided to the committee indicates that the intercontinental ballistic missile threat for which the national missile defense is intended is limited. The Intelligence people told our committee that such threats from rogue nations are not likely to occur for many years in the future. The tradeoff seems clear to me. The committee prefers to allocate the lion's share of resources to meet a poorly defined threat that lies somewhere in the distant future, rather than allocating resources to meet the near-term, real world threat of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Particularly, the bill does not fully fund programs intended to meet the threat of proliferation of weapons grade fissile materials, highly enriched uranium, and plutonium. A small amount of any of these materials in knowledgeable hands could wreak havoc upon our cities. It is extremely important that we continue to work cooperatively with Russia and with other former Soviet States to account for and secure former Soviet nuclear weapons and related nuclear materials. Despite the clear and present danger of that threat, the committee chose to reduce funding for the DOD's cooperative threat reduction program, also known as the Nunn-Lugar program, by $2 million after considering much deeper cuts. The committee cut similar programs managed by the Department of Energy by $20 million. Those programs are designed to improve the security of Russian nuclear weapons and materials and to provide protection against their theft, unauthorized use, or accidental misuse. The Department of Energy's materials protection control and accounting program provides those security measures to a small portion of Russia's nuclear arsenal. With more funding, that program could provide greater security against the threat of smuggling dangerous materials to terrorists or rogue nations. Instead, if the bill is passed as it stands, funding for this program--an essential program for our Nation's security now and in the future--is going to be cut. Efforts to secure hundreds of tons of nuclear materials at 53 sites will be delayed. Mr. President, I spoke of India and Pakistan a moment ago. I would like to take a few more minutes to relate that problem to this defense bill. Shocking as India and Pakistan's nuclear tests have been, they should serve as a wakeup call to this country and to the Senate. The proliferation clock ticks on, while the Senate defers debate and consideration of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Other nonnuclear States could be reconsidering their positions on nuclear weapons in light of events in south Asia. China, who is a signatory to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, may now choose not to ratify. The U.S.--the first to sign the treaty-- should have led the effort to implement a comprehensive testing ban before now. Perhaps our leadership in that area could have forestalled the tests in south Asia. Instead, the Senate has chosen not to step forward. Now we see ourselves more as a follower than as a leader in this area. One element that could support a leadership role in ratifying a comprehensive test ban is an effective nuclear stockpile stewardship program. That program is an essential element for ensuring the safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons in the absence of testing. The directors of our National Laboratories at Livermore, Los Alamos, and Sandia have testified about the effectiveness of that program in the absence of nuclear testing. In spite of that testimony, this bill reduces funding by $145 million in prior year balances that, according to the DOE, no longer exist. Without sufficient funding for the stockpile stewardship program, this bill threatens the likelihood of ratifying the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Failure to ratify that treaty plays into the hands of the Indian and Pakistani Governments and could encourage other nonnuclear nations to follow their lead. The result will be a far more dangerous world than the one we live in today. Mr. President, I am concerned that while many of my colleagues are focused on the long-term future security issues, they may have their focus in the wrong place. Funding for basic research and development and building, the building blocks for future technological advances, continues to receive low priority in this defense budget. It is not anticipated to increase for the foreseeable future under current Department of Defense plans. My colleagues acknowledged when considering this bill that funding for basic research and development has often been and remains a bill payer for other programs. Efforts to identify this problem and establish long-term spending goals for basic research were rejected during the deliberations in the committee on this bill. I believe that the high-tech future so many of us in the Senate consider an axiom of America's future security is unlikely to become a reality in the defense area unless we make the investment that is needed in the future today. In addition, funding for the Nation's test and evaluation facilities and their operations lags behind efforts to modernize our weapons.

Both staff and I have seen firsthand the wanton destruction and detrimental effects that illegal immigration and drug-running has had on some of our most fragile desert environments in our country. It has become so bad at Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument that up to one-third of the park is now closed to the public because the area is occupied by armed drug traffickers, and park employees cannot work throughout the park without an armed escort. We are not talking about potential impacts or future problems. These damages are occurring as we speak. I believe the National Park Service has blatantly ignored the congressional mandate to conserve these resources, including a number of listed species, unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations. While the U.S. Border Patrol is doing what it can to slow the flow of illegal activities through our parks, resource protection is not their priority.

Ehrlich: Mr. President, I want to continue part of the discussion that occurred earlier which was carried forward by the fine Senator from Iowa, Senator Grassley, and to a certain extent by Senator Domenici, the chairman of the Budget Committee, which involves the issue of where we stand in this whole budget process, because a very important fact has been confirmed. About 6 months ago we on the Republican side said that the Medicare trust fund was in serious trouble, that the senior citizens of this country were at risk for their health insurance because the Medicare trust fund was going broke. Now, we did not arbitrarily come up with that statement. We took that statement from the fact that the Medicare trustees, three of whom are appointed by the President and serve in his Cabinet, stated in their report of April 3, 1995, that the Medicare trust fund was going to go broke in the year 2002 if something was not done to fundamentally repair it. So we made the tough decisions of the party. We stepped forward, and we made proposals which made the Medicare trust fund solvent. Our proposals were included in the Balanced Budget Act, which gave this country for the first time in 25 years a balanced budget and which gave our senior citizens a solvent Medicare system. What happened? The President of the United States and his legions demagogued that act, claimed that we were attacking senior citizens, and used every scare tactic they could on senior citizens. The fundraising powerhouses here in Washington who scare seniors regularly got their machines of paper cranked up and sent out letters to seniors across this country representing that the Republicans were misrepresenting what was happening with the Medicare trust fund and were trying arbitrarily and inappropriately to take on the Medicare trust fund, when, in fact, what we were proposing would bring solvency to the trust fund. A couple of days ago, the chickens came home to roost for this administration because now, not only do their trustees have a report filed which says that the trust fund is going to go broke, we find that the track for the trust fund to go broke, to go bankrupt, has been accelerated, and that it is unfortunately ahead of schedule. A report by the Medicare trust fund actuary states, ``Things turned out a little worse than we expected. We had projected that 1997 would be the first fiscal year with a deficit when, in fact, this year becomes the first fiscal year with a deficit.'' What does that mean? That means, for the first time in the history of the Medicare trust fund, since 1972, this will be the first year when more money goes out of the trust fund than comes into the trust fund. That is a bankruptcy spiral that we have begun. I have a chart here which we have used before. It looks like a plane crash. In fact, it is called the plane crash chart, which shows what is happening with the Medicare trust fund. This chart assumed what the trustees originally told us, which was the trust fund would go broke in the year 2002, that it would start to run a deficit in the year 1997. We have to change this chart now. The trust fund now has a track that is something like this. It goes to the negative this year, and somewhere out here before the year 2002 it goes broke. If this administration does not step up and stop demagoging the issue and scaring seniors, what they are going to deliver to seniors is a trust fund that is broke. What right does this administration have to abuse the senior citizens in this manner? What right do they have to stand in one room at one microphone and say, ``Republicans are harassing and inappropriately attacking the trust fund and Medicare,'' while at the same time the facts show that, if a correction does not occur, the trust fund goes broke? A higher level of irresponsibility in managing this country and managing the finances and managing the future of our seniors probably has not been seen in recent times than what has happened over the issue of Medicare over the past 6 months as this administration and this President specifically have consistently misrepresented the Republican position and have failed to step up to the plate to address what is a critical issue for seniors. Basically this administration can no longer hide on the issue. The fact is their trustees have said it is going to happen, and now their actuary has said it is not only going to happen, but it is happening. It is happening in reality. We are now into a bankruptcy spiral in the Medicare trust fund. So, Mr. President, I suggest you stop running for reelection and that you sit down and do the job you are paid for, which is to come forward with a proposal which puts the Medicare trust fund back in balance or, alternatively, accept ours. Mr. President, I thank you for your time.","word.count":186,"sep11":-6.28370786516854,"years":1995.57584269663,"days":205,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.077314016054073,"Topic 2":0.0942355898395352,"Topic 3":0.294641506440027,"Topic 4":0.117549086171616,"Topic 5":0.309690915669942,"Topic 6":0.0076616017043872,"Topic 7":0.00379674982827282,"Topic 8":0.0368716044804751,"Topic 9":0.00787910017270228,"Topic 10":0.0503598296389695},{"id":"10820030002583","body":"Melvin Watt: Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for yielding. I rise in support of H. Res. 530, and I'd like to commend my colleague, Mr. Smith of New Jersey, for sponsoring this important and timely resolution. This bill urges the U.S. Representative to the 60th Session of a the United Nations Commission on Human Rights to introduce a resolution calling upon the Government of the People's Republic of China to end its human rights abuses. H. Res. 530 also urges the People's Republic of China to safeguard fundamental human rights. Last year at the 59th Session of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, the United States did not sponsor a resolution on the People's Republic of China. The United States refrained from doing so in part because of commitments which the Government of China made to the United States during bilateral talks in December of 2002 that it would improve its human rights record and would allow greater access of international monitors into the country. However, these commitments were not fulfilled. In fact, during the past year we witnessed continued disturbing trends in the human rights situation in China. Indeed, in last week's release of the State Department's annual Country Reports of Human Rights Practices, referring to China, it notes that, ``We saw backsliding on key human rights issues.'' Unfortunately, there are far too many examples of their ``backsliding.'' In January, Tibetan activist Lobsang Dhondup was executed without due process. Arrests and harsh sentencing of democracy activists, critics on the Internet, and labor organizers continued throughout the year. And other than the lone release of Tibetan prisoner of conscience, Phuntsog Nyidrol , last week--the day after the State Department's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices was released--there have been no recent releases of political prisoners. Further, religious adherents continue to be persecuted, and Falun Gong followers remain targeted by the government. Another area of grave concern is Beijing's forced repatriation of North Korean refugees in China and other human rights abuses directed against these refugees, including the trafficking of women and children. Mr. Speaker, the People's Republic of China must understand that increased bilateral cooperation in other areas, including security, does not in any way negate or lessen obligations to uphold basic human rights.

Mr. Speaker, as my colleague, the gentleman from Connecticut, pointed out, this Wednesday marks the 100th anniversary of the invention of the modern-day air conditioner by Dr. Willis Carrier, a New Yorker. Today I offer before the House, House Concurrent Resolution 413, recognizing this historic event. Raised on a farm on the snowy eastern shore of Lake Erie in Angola, New York, the young Carrier grew up as an only child, raised by his grandparents and great aunt. Known for his superior problem-solving capabilities, Carrier would solve every complex problem he encountered by reducing it to its simplest form and solving each component one by one. He once stated in a high school graduation essay, ``A man with the power of will could make himself anything he wished, no matter what the circumstances.'' These words would define the rest of Mr. Carrier's life. Carrier entered Cornell University at Ithaca College in Ithaca, New York, on a 4-year scholarship, but he was forced to earn room and board by mowing lawns, stoking furnaces, and during his senior year, forming a co-op student laundry. With a degree in mechanical engineering, he found a job at the Buffalo Forge Company in 1901 and he began designing heating systems to dry lumber and coffee. Carrier was soon made head of the company's department of experimental engineering. It was here that he solved his first problem in temperature and humidity control for the Sackett- Wilhelms Lithographing and Publishing Company in Brooklyn in 1902. Marking the birth of modern air conditioning, Carrier's device controlled temperature, humidity, ventilation and air quality. In 1915, Carrier and six colleagues pooled together their life savings and founded Carrier Engineering Corporation in New York. In 1910 the company bought its first building in Newark, New Jersey and soon found its way back to our Empire State. In 1937 Carrier consolidated five plants on Geddes Street near my home in Syracuse. In 1947 Carrier moved to its present location on Thompson Road in the town of Dewitt, also in my congressional district. Today Carrier Corporation, the company that bears the founder's name, is a nearly $9 billion organization and remains the global leader in providing heating, cooling and refrigeration solutions in more than 172 countries around the world. As an aside, my colleague from Connecticut will appreciate this. As a Peace Corps volunteer in Nepal, the only night I spent in an air-conditioned room in about 2-and-a-half years was in a Carrier air-conditioned room in Kathmandu, Nepal. The 43,000 worldwide employees of Carrier Corporation can be proud that they continue to carry on their founder's tradition of excellence by generating comfort wherever people work, live and play. Many of us take for granted the fact that air conditioning has become an integral technology, enabling the advancement of society through improvements to our Nation's health and well-being, manufacturing processes, building capacities, food preservation and general productivity and indoor comfort. From its birth 100 years ago to today's $36 billion industry, employing 700,000 Americans, we can all be very proud of Dr. Carrier. He did indeed change history. I suspect that if he did not invent air conditioning, we would not be meeting in Washington today because they used to close the Capitol in the beginning of the summer and stay away long until late in the fall. This invention also may have created a tremendous upsurge in the amount of legislation passed by this body, so maybe all is not progress. The Sistine Chapel in Rome is air-conditioned with Carrier air conditioning. Many great documents of this country are enshrined in museums and the air is conditioned also by Carrier air conditioning. Indeed, this building in which we meet today is also chilled by Carrier air chillers. So in gratitude for all of that, I would ask unanimous support of H. Con. Res. 413 and I ask Members to join me in celebrating this 100-year anniversary.","word.count":296,"sep11":-0.137640449438202,"years":2001.72191011236,"days":2393,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0819923207802037,"Topic 2":0.0742997505755745,"Topic 3":0.20734277415137,"Topic 4":0.203395509658917,"Topic 5":0.00529129895218163,"Topic 6":0.0037348352785559,"Topic 7":0.00460687937636042,"Topic 8":0.0210159999128457,"Topic 9":0.114959949368467,"Topic 10":0.283360681945524},{"id":"11020070088867","body":"Harry Reid: Mr. President, I say to my friend, the distinguished chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, a tireless advocate for Native Americans his entire career, I have 22 different tribal organizations in the State of Nevada.

This legislation contains many unacceptable provisions that would undercut U.S. leadership abroad and damage our ability to assure the future security and prosperity of the American people. It would unacceptably restrict the President's ability to address the complex international challenges and opportunities of the post-Cold War era. It would also restrict Presidential authority needed to conduct foreign affairs and to control state secrets, thereby raising serious constitutional concerns. First, the bill contains foreign policy provisions, particularly those involving East Asia, that are of serious concern. It would amend the Taiwan Relations Act to state that the TRA supersedes the provisions of the 1982 Joint Communique between the United States and China. The 1982 Communique has been one of the cornerstones of our bipartisan policy toward China for over 13 years. The ongoing management of our relations with China is one of the central challenges of United States foreign policy, but this bill would complicate, not facilitate that task. The bill would also sharply restrict the use of funds to further normalize relations with Vietnam, hampering the President's ability to pursue our national interests there and potentially jeopardizing further progress on POW/ MIA issues. If read literally, this restriction would also raise constitutional concerns. Second, the bill would seriously impede the President's authority to organize and administer foreign affairs agencies to best serve the Nation's interests and the Administration's foreign policy priorities. I am a strong supporter of appropriate reform and, building on bipartisan support, my Administration has already implemented significant steps to reinvent our international operations in a way that has allowed us to reduce funding significantly, eliminate positions, and close embassies, consulates, and other posts overseas. But this bill proceeds in an improvident fashion, mandating the abolition of at least one of three important foreign affairs agencies, even though each agency has a distinct and important mission that warrants a separate existence. Moreover, the inflexible, detailed mandates and artificial deadlines included in this section of the bill should not be imposed on any President. Third, the appropriations authorizations included in the bill, for fiscal years 1996 and 1997, fall unacceptably below the levels necessary to conduct the Nation's foreign policy and to protect U.S. interests abroad. These inadequate levels would adversely affect the operation of overseas posts of the foreign affairs agencies and weaken critical U.S. efforts to promote arms control and nonproliferation, reform international organizations and peacekeeping, streamline public diplomacy, and implement sustainable development activities. These levels would cause undue reductions in force of highly skilled personnel at several foreign affairs agencies at a time when they face increasingly complex challenges. Fourth, this bill contains a series of objectionable provisions that limit U.S. participation in international organizations, particularly the United Nations . For example, a provision on intelligence sharing with the U.N. would unconstitutionally infringe on the President's power to conduct diplomatic relations and limit Presidential control over the use of state secrets. Other provisions contain problematic notification, withholding, and certification requirements. These limits on participation in international organizations, particularly when combined with the low appropriation authorization levels, would undermine current U.S. diplomatic efforts--which enjoy bipartisan support--to reform the U.N. budget. The provisions included in the bill are also at odds with ongoing discussions between the Administration and the Congress aimed at achieving consensus on these issues. Fifth, the bill fails to remedy the severe limitations placed on U.S. population assistance programs by the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1996 . That law imposes unacceptable spending restrictions pending authorization for U.S. bilateral and multilateral population assistance programs. But H.R. 1561 does not authorize these programs. Consequently, these restrictions will remain in place and will have a significant, adverse impact on women and families in the developing world. It is estimated that nearly 7 million couples in developing countries will have no access to safe, voluntary family planning services. The result will be millions of unwanted pregnancies and an increase in the number of abortions. Finally, the bill contains a number of other objectionable provisions. Some of the most problematic would: abruptly terminate the Agency for International Development's housing guaranty program, as well as abrogate existing HG agreements, except for South Africa, and prohibit foreign assistance to any country that fails to make timely payments or reimbursements on HG loans; hinder negotiations aimed at resolving the plight of Vietnamese boat people; unduly restrict the ability of the United States to participate in the United Nations Human Rights Committee; and extend provisions of the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act that I have objected to in the past. I am also concerned that the bill, by restricting the time period during which economic assistance funds can be expended for longer-term development projects, would diminish the effectiveness of U.S. assistance programs. In returning H.R. 1561, I recognize that the bill contains a number of important authorities for the Department of State and the United States Information Agency. In its current form, however, the bill is inconsistent with the decades-long tradition of bipartisanship in U.S. foreign policy. It unduly interferes with the constitutional prerogatives of the President and would seriously impair the conduct of U.S. foreign affairs. For all these reasons, I am compelled to return H.R. 1561 without my approval.

We now have 22 million acres of our forested lands in crisis because of the fuel loading that has been talked about because of a management style of the last 50 years. Yet there seems to be no desire to deal with this on a constructive, environmentally positive basis that begins to remove that fuel. The amendment of the Senator from New Mexico, of which I am now a cosponsor, which is a substitute offered to my amendment, goes at this problem in a very real and direct way. That is why I think it is so important that we move forward. I have been advised--and I agree--we should allow the courts to act on the Federal Advisory Committee Act. We will find out whether we have a real law or whether we have a false law; whether it works or it does not work. We will know that by mid- August. If they rule otherwise, we have either to come in and revise it or I think the Congress should act and intervene against the President in his rulemaking process, outside the public policymaking process of the Congress itself. But in the meantime, there is no question in my mind, with my activities, looking at the U.S. forest-managed lands-- last week I was in Great Falls, MN. Last year, on July 4, they had a 472,000-acre blowdown. There are fuel loading problems in that State and every other State in the Nation that has public forested lands, that are phenomenal in their nature. Let me explain. The Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, talked about literally having barrels of gasoline on the ground, in equivalent Btus of fire capability. It is believed that in these areas, 22 million acres, at least at the top of the stack, that fuel loading equivalency is nearly 10,000 gallons of gasoline per acre in equivalent Btu or firepower. Yet our Forest Service and this administration choose not to do anything about it. If we are good stewards of the land, we will not allow the stand-altering, environmentally crazy policy of catastrophic fire of the kind in the forests of New Mexico and the kind that are burning across the West today to be the policy of the management of our forests. I would be the first to tell you we ought to reenter fire as a management tool of the ecosystems of our forests, but fire ought not enter an acre of land that has 10,000 gallons of gasoline stored in the form of slash and dead and dying timber in equivalent Btu's. That we cannot tolerate, or it will truly destroy the land as we know it, the environment as we know it, the riparian areas as we know them, and certainly habitat for any wildlife, let alone any kind of constructive management that would provide the needed fiber for our public in home building, paper, and so many materials we have wisely used our forests for over the years. I support Senator Domenici, Senator Bingaman, and Senator Feinstein as a cosponsor of this substitute. It is critically important. In closing, in the substitute there is an important analysis, and it is an analysis that deals with the roadless problem. If the amendment of the Senator from New Mexico becomes law, it will cause the Forest Service to develop a cohesive strategy for protecting people and sustaining resources in fire-adaptive ecosystems; in other words, a fire strategy to deal with these kinds of fuel loadings. It would then have to place that strategy against the other rulemaking processes that are underway. One of those rulemaking processes is the roadless area review or the roadless area protection proposal, to see whether that proposal denies the Forest Service the ability to manage these lands to protect them from catastrophic fire. I find that an important test and a necessary analysis of where we are going and how we want to manage these lands. It also causes them to look at the areas of concern of the Senator from California--the Sierra Nevada framework and the Sierra Nevada draft plan environmental impact statements. All of those deserve to be examined in light of the fire situation we have on these public lands at this moment. We cannot idly sit by and watch hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of acres a year burn in wildfires, destroying wildlife habitat, destroying fiber that could be constructively used and, most important, dramatically altering the ecosystems of those areas that embody these catastrophic fires. I support the substitute. It is important we stay in focus on the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The courts will rule in August, and then Congress will be able to act according to that ruling if, in fact, the courts have decided the Federal Advisory Committee Act is a dead letter in public law.

Dorgan: If I might, in a separate part of the Record, I wish to talk about something that showed up in the newspapers this morning as well. I wish to tell you first--this was not in the papers this morning--about something that was a while back. I wish to tell you about a 4-year-old boy named Jarnell Brown. Jarnell Brown was from Minnesota. Jarnell is now dead. Jarnell is dead because he was visiting a friend's house, and he swallowed a small heart-shaped charm that came on a bracelet that came with a pair of Reebok tennis shoes. It turns out that little charm, that little jewelry charm contained 99 percent lead, and it killed Jarnell Brown. It was 99 percent lead. It came from China, which probably should not surprise us. It suggests, once again, in this global economy--in which we decide we are going to produce elsewhere and ship here, after we spent a century developing standards to protect workers, protect consumers, the kinds of things Americans basically expect to be protected for and from--we decide we are going to outsource all that so we will have all these products made elsewhere and shipped into our country. So we get tennis shoes, and we get a charm bracelet, and we get a heart attached to the end of the bracelet that is 99 percent lead, and the young boy accidentally swallows that little heart and dies from lead poisoning. Now, let me talk a bit about this morning's news. Mattel is announcing this morning a product recall. They are recalling 848,000 Chinese-made Barbie and Fisher-Price toys that have excessive amounts of lead. Toys are being pulled from store shelves, including Barbie kitchen and furniture items, Fisher-Price train toys, and Bongo Band drums. These are innocent enough looking products. But the surface paint on these products contains excessive levels of lead, prohibited under our Federal laws because of the serious threat they pose to human health, particularly the health of young children. I do not suggest that Mattel has any response this morning other than being heartsick and heartbroken over this situation. Mattel is a good company. But what has happened to Mattel has happened to many other companies. They outsource production and then ship the product into this country, and there is no determination of whether those products are produced under the same conditions we would require in this country. We only inspect 1 percent of the products that come into this country. So whether it is food or toys or jewelry or other things we require certain kinds of standards with respect to its production here, yet there are no such standards required with respect to production elsewhere. Oh, I know the people who outsource these contracts will say: Well, we require this and that of them. But there is no enforcement, and everyone knows that. Let me describe a few of the circumstances. I talk about the lead paint. As we know, lead paint is used because it is bright, durable, flexible, fast drying, and, above all, it is cheap. So the Chinese, we now know from products that are being pulled from the shelves, have used lead paint. They mass produce lead paint and coloring agents such as lead chromate that are generally cheaper than other pigments, so we are now seeing the effect of that on store shelves. This poor 4-year-old boy felt the effect in the most extreme way. He died. It is not just China, and it is not just toys. FDA inspectors recently intercepted shipments of black pepper with salmonella from India, intercepted crab meat from Mexico too filthy to eat, and produce from the Dominican Republic was stopped 813 times last year for containing traces of illegal pesticides--this is a country with whom we just signed a trade agreement. Now let me describe--even as we have galloped globally to outsource production but not to develop and maintain the protections for the American consumers on the products coming in--the Food and Drug Administration. Under the Bush administration, the FDA's safety mission I think has been substantially reduced. In fact, the FDA is planning to close 7 of its 13 drug safety labs, and it would close or consolidate a number of its 20 regional offices. The trend has been to inspect fewer, not more, imports into this country under the administration. The FDA tests, we are told, about 1 percent of imported food. Last year, the FDA took 50 percent fewer samples for testing from imported seafood than it did in the year previous. The issue is not just China, but China has been in the news more than any other country. Let me describe the circumstance of China because that has become the most notorious offshore platform. Toys, dolls, games, for all of these products China ranks as our No. 1 source of imports; fish, seafood, China is No. 1. Tires, China is No. 1; also for pet food, and toothpaste; and the list goes on. In fact, we have such a giant trade deficit with China--this chart shows what is happening with our trade relationship with China, which I think demonstrates an incompetence that is almost breathtaking for this country, an incompetence with respect to the negotiating of trade agreements and an incompetence with respect to enforcing trade agreements. But aside from that, I describe a circumstance here, and we are seeing it now every day in the newspapers, of the danger to U.S. consumers. Well, pet food--how many Americans had their pets die as a result of contaminated pet food coming into this country? It was discovered that animal food, pet food from China contained substances that are dangerous to pets. Sixty million packages of pet food under 150 brands were recalled after it was found that ingredients in pet food could be dangerous to pets. Seafood--the U.S. FDA banned the import of five types of farm-raised fish and shrimp from China after they were found to contain unsafe drugs, some of which cause cancer. Now, I am telling you what they have found and banned, and I am telling you they have only inspected 1 percent. Toothpaste, Chinese-made toothpaste sold in dollar stores--the FDA has warned consumers to throw out any toothpaste made in China. In fact, they not only found some of the toothpaste was contaminated with a dangerous ingredient, they found other toothpaste that was contaminated with the ingredient and did not list the ingredient on the toothpaste box. Toys and jewelry--I mentioned Mattel. There are others. Mattel has had three very substantial recalls of Chinese-made toys in the last 5 months. Again, my guess is the executives of that company are heartsick about what is happening. But it is a result of exporting manufacturing and not having the protections with respect to the conditions under which that product is manufactured--the protections for American consumers that we have always come to expect. I did not mention with respect to toys, the RC2 Corporation recalled 1.5 million of these little toys, Thomas & Friends from its Wooden Railway product line, made by Hansheng Wood Products Factory in China using lead paint. According to a spot check recently, it was announced 20 percent of Chinese-made jewelry contains potentially poisonous chemicals, including lead. Automobile tires--a tire importer called Foreign Tire Sales recalled 255,000 Chinese-made tires in August because they lacked a safety feature that prevents tread separation. I do not need to go through much more but only to say this: These are real serious issues. I started by talking about a young 4-year-old boy named Jarnell Brown. He died. There are real consequences to these issues. We spent a century developing standards in this country to protect workers, to protect consumers, and we built something very special and very important in this country. Now, under a galloping global economy, in which the rules have not kept pace, we are told: Well--do you know what?--we are going to outsource manufacturing because we can pay people 30 cents an hour in sweatshops somewhere around the world, and we can have it manufactured for less money. Well, if that cheap product is unsafe for your health, if that product--whether it is food or vegetables or toys or jewelry--if that product is harmful to your health, we need to rethink the standards by which we engage in this global economy. Yes, it is a global economy, and I do not suggest we are going to retreat from the global economy. I do suggest this: We should participate in the global economy on our terms. We should describe what kind of participation we will have with respect to this economy in a way that is fair to our workers, that earns a decent wage in this country, and in a way that protects our consumers for whom we have established certain consumer protections. I know someone will say that is regulation. Yes, it is regulation. I spoke on the floor of the Senate one day, when I held up a package of beef. I asked consent to do that. You have to have consent to hold up a package of beef on the floor of the Senate because it is an object to show. I said: I do not think anybody can tell me where this beef came from. I know they could not because it is not labeled. So then I read the description of what the investigator found, the inspector found when he went to a plant in Hermosillo, Mexico, and inspected a plant that was processing beef, slaughtering cattle, processing beef and shipping it to the United States. He found carcasses hanging under a hot roof, with flies and feces all over the carcasses. He described horrendous things that I read on the floor of the Senate and led me to ask: Does anybody want to buy beef from that circumstance? Well, guess what. It was the only time that plant had ever been inspected--the only time. As a result, the plant lost its license. It then was sold, then changed its name, and was relicensed. It is now selling beef to the United States and has never again been inspected. I use that only to say it is exactly the same coin--the flip side of the same coin, of lead paint coming in a heart-shaped toy from China t","word.count":1873,"sep11":6.1376404494382,"years":2007.99719101124,"days":4627,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.87127020278429,"Topic 2":0.0417981625281574,"Topic 3":0.0105347488958779,"Topic 4":0.0215109383097793,"Topic 5":0.00942250651729714,"Topic 6":0.0096654959693992,"Topic 7":0.00686948063217163,"Topic 8":0.016099759368429,"Topic 9":0.00887996259659656,"Topic 10":0.00394874239800218},{"id":"10419950144265","body":"Bill Bradley: Mr. President, our American flag is best protected by preserving the freedom that it symbolized. I cannot support a constitutional amendment that would limit that freedom. At the same time, I believe that anyone who burns the American flag is an ungrateful lowlife who fails to understand how special and unique our country is, and I tremendously respect those New Jerseyans who support this amendment and have urged my support with great dignity and conviction. Like most Americans, I revere the flag as a symbol of our national unity. I want it protected from abuse. That is why I strongly supported the Flag Protection Act of 1989, which sought to punish those who would destroy our flag. That is why I regretted the Supreme Court's subsequent decision in United States versus Eichmann, which declared the law in violation of the first amendment. That is also why I enthusiastically support and today urge passage of another law that would make it illegal for someone to burn a flag, if the act itself would incite violence. In our system, the first amendment is what the Supreme Court at a particular time says it is. The Court has said that the Flag Protection Act violates freedom of expression. A future Supreme Court may reverse that decision. Although I wish the Supreme Court had ruled the other way, it did not. The question now is whether protecting the flag merits amending the Bill of Rights. In making the decision to oppose this amendment, I consulted my heart and my mind. My heart says to honor all those who died defending American liberty. My heart conjures up images of the marines holding the flag on Iwo Jima, the crosses in the fields at Flanders, the faces of friends who never came back from Vietnam. My heart says, what a nation believes in, what it will preserve, what it will sacrifice for, fight for, die for, is rarely determined by words. Often people cannot express in language their feelings about many things. How do I know? Because I struggle with it every day. Remember the pain you felt when the Challenger exploded before your eyes? Remember the joy you felt when World War II and the Korean war ended? Remember the shock you felt when you learned of the assassinations of President Kennedy and Martin Luther King? Remember the feelings of attachment you have for the Lincoln Memorial, the Statue of Liberty, the U.S. flag? These are symbols and shared memories for places, events, and things that tie us to our past, our country, and to each other, even when there are no words at all. When someone gives respect and recognition to them, we are moved, sometimes to tears. When someone demeans them or shows disrespect, we are outraged. My heart says honor the flag, and I do. My mind says, when our children ask why America is special among the nations of the world, we tell them about the clear, simple words of the Bill of Rights, about how Americans who won our independence believed that all people were blessed by nature and by God, with the freedom to worship and to express themselves as they please. We found these truths to be self- evident before any other nation in the world did, and even before we created the flag to symbolize them. Our Founding Fathers believed that fundamental to our democratic process was the unfettered expression of ideas. That is why the amendment that protects your right to express yourself freely is the first amendment, and politicians should never put that right at risk. Now if this constitutional amendment passes, we will have done something no Americans have ever done--amended the Bill of Rights to limit personal freedom. Even if you agree with the flag amendment, how can you know that the next amendment will be one you will like? You cannot. So let us not start. Once you begin chipping away, where does it stop? Do not risk long-term protection of personal freedom for a short-term political gain. America's moral fiber is strong. Flag burning is reprehensive, but our Nation's character remains solid. My best judgment says we are in control of our destiny by what we do every day. We know the truth of Mrs. Barbara Bush's words that America's future will be determined more by what happens in your house than by what happens in the White House. I have traveled America for over 25 years. I know we still have standards, insist on quality, believe in hard work, honesty, care about our families, have faith in God. A rapidly changing world looks to us to help them define for themselves what it means to be free. Our leadership depends more than ever on our example. This is the time to be confident enough in our values, conscientious enough in our actions, and proud enough in our spirit to condemn the antisocial acts of a few despicable jerks without narrowing our basic freedoms. My mind says that the best way to honor those who died to preserve our freedom is to protect those freedoms and then get on with the business of making America a better place. I took an oath to support and to defend the Constitution of the United States. Each Senator has to decide in her own mind and in his own heart what he feels he must do, to fulfill the promise he made to preserve and to stand by the Constitution. Different Senators will arrive at different answers. For me, this amendment does not preserve the Constitution. To the contrary, it constricts, narrows, limits-- makes it less than it was before. To preserve means to keep intact, to avoid decay, but this amendment would leave freedom of expression less intact, less robust, more in a state of decay. To support an amendment which would, for the first time in 204 years, reduce the personal freedom that all Americans have been guaranteed by the Constitution would be, for me, inconsistent with my oath. I will never break my oath. Finally, in his dissenting opinion on flag burning, Justice Stevens warned us about using the flag ``as a pretext for partisan dispute about meaner ends.'' Politics can be a mean business, but it can also be a glorious business. Sometimes an event has unexpected consequences. Let's be frank; there is patriotism on both sides of this debate. So let me tell you what I believe about patriotism. Patriotism--I know how it feels to be proud to be an American. I remember how I felt back in 1964 when the United States Olympic basketball team defeated the Soviet Union in the finals--I remember standing on the victory stand, with the gold medal around my neck, chills running up and down my spine, as the flag was raised and the national anthem played. I was proud to have won--for myself and for my country. Patriotism--it is like strength. If you have it, you do not need to wear it on your sleeve. The patriot is not the loudest one in praise of his country, or the one whose chest swells the most when the parade passes by, or the one who never admits we could do anything better. No, a patriot is one who is there when individual liberty is threatened from abroad, whether it is World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, or even the wrongheaded action in Beirut in 1983--yes, that too. All those who served in these conflicts were defending liberty as our democracy chose, in its sometimes fallible way, to define the need to defend liberty. But you do not need a war to show your patriotism. Patriotism is often unpretentious greatness. A patriot goes to work every day to make America a better place--in schools, hospitals, farms, laboratories, factories, offices, all across this land. A patriot knows that a welfare worker should listen, a teacher should teach, a nurse should give comfort. A patriot accords respect and dignity to those she meets. A patriot tries, in a secular as well as a spiritual sense, to be his brother's keeper. When the only grandfather I ever knew came to America, he went to work in a glass factory. He worked with his hands, and he worked long and hard. After work he lived for three things: The first thing he lived for was going to the public library on a Saturday night to check out western novels, which he would read and reread over and over again. The second thing he lived for was to sit on his front porch on summer nights with a railroad whistle in the background and listen on the radio to his real love, baseball. And the third thing he lived for was to tell his grandson--me--what America meant to him. He said America was great because it was free and because people seem to care about each other. Those two, freedom and caring, are the two inseparable halves of American patriotism. As Americans who love our flag, we must not sacrifice the substance of that freedom for its symbol, and we must learn to care more about each other. We must not restrict our fundamental freedom. To do so, I believe, would betray the meaning of the oath I took to support the Constitution and the promise I made to myself to always do what I thought was right. I oppose this amendment.","word.count":1575,"sep11":-5.89887640449438,"years":1995.9606741573,"days":342,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.681198779533853,"Topic 2":0.103280734995898,"Topic 3":0.0198793322762997,"Topic 4":0.0760792367626257,"Topic 5":0.0188268525663494,"Topic 6":0.0157769375853644,"Topic 7":0.0184369744111848,"Topic 8":0.0320869270117347,"Topic 9":0.0246259420095408,"Topic 10":0.00980828284714994},{"id":"10419960041365","body":"Sherrod Brown: Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio and add my support for naming the Cleveland courthouse after my friend Carl Stokes. When I was, I believe, a teenager either in high school or perhaps college, I read ``Promises of Power,'' the story of Carl Stokes and how he overcame adversity and made so much of himself. He was elected to the State legislature and then moved on to become mayor of one of the great cities of this country. I never had the honor of knowing Carl Stokes when he was mayor. I got to know Carl Stokes after he became a judge and knew him obviously as Judge Stokes and saw the great kind of public service that he gave to northeast Ohio, to his city of Cleveland. Carl was elected mayor before his older brother, Lou, I believe, ever ran for anything. One of the highlights of this year for me was actually going to Carl Stokes' funeral, which was not a mournful time; it was a time of celebration in a lot of ways. I remember that Lou, and older brother, stood up at Carl's funeral and he said, and for those who knew Carl Stokes and those who know Lou, they know that Carl was very outgoing and very colorful and very outspoken and sometimes got a little carried away, and Lou is much more reserved. Lou is every bit as smart, but much more reserved and much quieter and lends his leadership in a different sort of way. I remember the highlight of the funeral probably was when Lou stood at the podium, and he looked up and he said Carl never really understood what it was like to be a younger brother. Again, one had to know both Lou and Carl to understand that. But while Carl was great in his way, of the kind of charismatic leadership that the time demanded, it was Carl, the younger brother, who always looked to Lou, the older brother, I think in quieter times. I do not think Carl would ever have admitted that in public, but the leadership they have both shown and given to this country is remarkable. I am pleased to lend my name and support to this resolution and to honor Carl Stokes for the work he did for Cleveland and the work he did nationally for this country and for our communities.","word.count":401,"sep11":-5.08426966292135,"years":1996.77528089888,"days":632,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.107578464479119,"Topic 2":0.23822258220995,"Topic 3":0.0101404271581978,"Topic 4":0.00706119666975996,"Topic 5":0.280382690313268,"Topic 6":0.0111403600834045,"Topic 7":0.00452434817901437,"Topic 8":0.208819337354204,"Topic 9":0.00768534612925259,"Topic 10":0.12444524742383},{"id":"10519980036673","body":"Joe Pitts: Mr. Speaker, for 7 months, Americans have been wondering why there is a deafening silence from the feminist organizations in Washington.

This legislation significantly improves the ability of our Nation's law enforcement authorities to curtail money laundering and prosecute criminals involved in these illegal activities. The Committee on Banking and Financial Services has had a successful and long bipartisan history of bringing anti-money laundering legislation to the floor of this House of Representatives and, following its completion, enactment into law. We have traditionally reported bills making it more difficult for drug pushers and other criminals to deposit their profits in the legitimate banking system and have cleared the path and policies so that prosecutors can effectively charge and put these criminals in jail. This measure continues that effort because it clarifies and perfects existing law and regulations that have already been proven effective in the effort to curtail money laundering. I believe it is important to focus the attention of the House on the series of amendments adopted in committee. These are amendments offered by our colleague the gentlewoman from California , who is without peer in her efforts to get to the heart of serious drug problems in her Los Angeles congressional district. The Waters amendments target the sensitive and secret world of the private banking community. The Waters amendments were designed to make certain that the comfort and courtesies afforded the wealthy in the banking board rooms are subject to the same reporting requirements enforced in the lobbies of our financial institutions. With the passage of the Waters amendments, the committee will have some of the information it will need to ensure that laws of our Nation are fully enforced, even in the rarified world of private banking. An important part of this bill reported by the Committee on Banking and Financial Services has been deleted in deference to the jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means. To complement the reporting requirements imposed on the financial industry, the Ways and Means Committee amended the tax code to require that all businesses and professional corporations file a report with the IRS whenever they accept $10,000 or more in cash as payment for goods and services provided. In hearings before our Committee, we received testimony which indicated that the protections appropriately provided to information gathered under the tax code were otherwise impeding the ability of the law enforcement community to access and use this information. The provisions of H.R. 4005, as reported by the Committee, transferred the reporting requirement from the tax code to the Bank Secrecy Act, the statute under which the financial institutions reports are presently collected and made available to legitimate law enforcement authorities. That provision has now been dropped. Although I accept and understand the need for the Ways and Means Committee to be able to review amendments to the tax code, the American public should not be asked to accept inefficiencies in our crime fighting policies because of the Congress' rules of jurisdiction. Mr. Speaker, I sincerely hope that the Committee on Ways and Means will soon conduct a full review of the referenced 8300 reporting requirements so that appropriate changes can be made as soon as possible to maximize the use of these valued reports. Finally, Mr. Speaker, I want to again compliment the gentleman from Iowa for his leadership in bringing this bill not only through the committee, but to the full House in a timely manner and basis. This bill is an important step in providing the law enforcement community the tools they need to keep money laundering under control. I again urge adoption of this bill and support for it. Mr. Speaker, I submit for the Record the thoughtful statements supporting the bill from the gentleman from New York , the ranking Democrat Member. Mr. LaFALCE: Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 4005, The Money Laundering Deterrence Act of 1998. I wish to join the Ranking Member of the Financial Institutions Subcommittee, Congressman Bruce Vento, in complimenting the distinguished Chairman of the Banking Committee, Congressman Jim Leach, for bringing this bill to the floor in a timely manner. As was noted by previous speakers, this legislation significantly improves the ability of our nation's law enforcement authorities to bring money launderers to justice. H.R. 4005 continues the Banking Committee's long and bipartisan tradition of reporting important anti-money laundering legislation to the House of Representatives. Today's bill continues this effort in that it further improves existing law and encourages greater reporting of suspicious financial activity by financial institutions and their agents. I am pleased to report that some of the most important provisions of this bill were introduced as amendments authored by the distinguished Congresswoman from California, Maxine Waters. Congresswoman Waters' tremendous energy and dedication to the concerns of Congressional District have led her to be one of the Congress' most vigilant crusaders against those who would use the traditional banking system to launder illegal proceeds, particularly those profits realized from the sale of illegal drugs in her South Central Los Angeles District. The Waters' amendments were designed to make certain that wealthy individuals cannot use their influence to cause banks to ``look the other way'' when it comes to those laws the banks normally implement vigorously. With the passage of the Waters amendments, the Committee will have begun the effort of investigating private banking practices, particularly as they relate to serving wealthy individuals who insist on secrecy in their financial dealings.

Mr. President, let me respond by saying that that is an incredibly difficult position for the Senator from Oregon to be placed in. What I would try to do is explain to my constituency in eastern Oregon what the facts are. I would point out to them that the Amtrak officials who went back from that meeting and met with the Amtrak board said, you know, we should keep this going for another year to give them a chance to work this out, and were met with a response that said, if we do not cut 10 more routes and cut out another $1.5 million or $2.6 million, whatever the number may be, Mr. Wolf, the chairman of the committee over on the House side, is going to cut everything out, because he is going to turn to us and say that Amtrak is doing what the Senator from Utah has said. Amtrak is continuing to put money into a line that costs money. And we have run out of runway. We, the Amtrak management, have run out of runway. Then I would say to them that Amtrak's inability to give you another year is not related to what they really want to do. The truth of the matter is, Amtrak knows that their ultimate future lies in a national rail system--not a Northeast rail system, but a national rail system-- and the reason it does is that we are going to, over the next 30 years, have increases in population and shifts in population around this country that cannot be accommodated merely by building more airports and highways. So for every day that we grow older as a country, the necessity for extending rail as a mode of transportation increases exponentially. Then I would say to them that we had a problem back in 1934 and 1935 and 1936 when all those Eastern Senators and their constituency said, why in God's name are we paying to build those dams out there in the West? Why are we doing that? I do not understand that. I am taking my hard-earned tax dollars to build a dam on the Columbia River, or on the whatever river, and I do not know eastern Oregon well enough to cite a specific dam, if it does affect eastern Oregon. And I would say what happened then was somebody stood up and said, look, this is in the national interest. Now, if we spend the billions of dollars to build those dams out West, if we spend the billions of dollars to do those things, what we will eventually do is our economy will grow in the East as well. We will benefit, but you are not going to see it for a day, a week, a year, 10 years, a decade. It may take several decades for that to be seen. And that is the hardest thing to convince any constituency that understandably is aggrieved and understandably has need for a service and has money being taken out of their pockets for something they do not see develop quickly. The last thing I would say to them is that those who are pushing the hardest to continue to fund Amtrak are the people who support you the most, who are the people who are saying, we should give you a year and we should give you more than that, we should give you flexibility to be able to work out compacts with the other States in the region in order to be able to use other moneys that are available to you to keep the Pioneer running. However, I do not in any way suggest that it is an easy sell. We are a nation, whether we are in the East, West, South or North, that is very much accustomed to and seeks an instant answer to a larger problem. My experience has not been in eastern Oregon, although I have been there once at a major political event, but my experience has been that when one explains in honest terms to your constituency the overall benefit that will accrue to them, in fact, sometimes they are willing to forbear them not having movement immediately. But I certainly appreciate the Senator's problem. Let me tell you something that happened to me recently. I will not mention the Senator. I got a call from the president of Amtrak saying, ``I don't know what to do. One of the States that we need help from is telling us that they want to keep their particular train going in their State. These two Senators have said basically, if you don't continue to keep this train moving, we are not going to be willing to vote for the things that need to be done,'' whether it was the half-cent gas tax, whether it was the use of rural funds, or whether it was the direct funding. And, he says, ``Then I got a call from a major political figure who holds significant office beyond Senator here in this body, saying, if you continue to fund that train which is not making money, I will not be willing to support Amtrak's long-term needs.'' It is really a catch-22 circumstance. That is why I wish we could all basically say time out, time out for a couple of years. Let us explain two things. Unless you get the Northeast corridor up and running with the new train sets, you have no section of the system that is going to be generating a profit. Unless you provide more flexibility to the States to be able to kick in and work in compacts-- you helped me in the compact amendment we had last year.","word.count":954,"sep11":-5.10955056179775,"years":1996.75,"days":623,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0748749544525482,"Topic 2":0.286766409412345,"Topic 3":0.0671415639690533,"Topic 4":0.017981421474413,"Topic 5":0.0309912052117216,"Topic 6":0.0082969312616952,"Topic 7":0.00651115196728456,"Topic 8":0.207630234528857,"Topic 9":0.0136539230999349,"Topic 10":0.286152204622146},{"id":"10619990048071","body":"John Chafee: Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.","word.count":518,"sep11":-2.58988764044944,"years":1999.26966292135,"days":1520,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.126645118249807,"Topic 2":0.154377084079806,"Topic 3":0.00929869564282814,"Topic 4":0.042968618559603,"Topic 5":0.00580678619436223,"Topic 6":0.00841146107296169,"Topic 7":0.0166663652075622,"Topic 8":0.017504921576866,"Topic 9":0.613183248421166,"Topic 10":0.00513770099503663},{"id":"10820030057276","body":"Kay Bailey Hutchison: Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Foreign Relations be authorized to meet during the session of the Senate on Wednesday, June 23, 2004, at 3 p.m., to hold a briefing on Iraq.","word.count":417,"sep11":1.61797752808989,"years":2003.47752808989,"days":3018,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0957289551446833,"Topic 2":0.334913852885733,"Topic 3":0.0627158438348966,"Topic 4":0.00939980406718272,"Topic 5":0.0113882144559957,"Topic 6":0.0215092328622306,"Topic 7":0.296603853227779,"Topic 8":0.0354221295744306,"Topic 9":0.128999370288031,"Topic 10":0.00331874365903726},{"id":"10720020022766","body":"Louise Slaughter: Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from New York for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. Mr. Speaker, anyone who plays popular sheet music knows that at the beginning of a piece there is always a place called ``vamp until ready'' where the pianist literally kills time until we are ready for the main act when the singer comes on. I think this bill comes into the category of vamp until ready. Obviously, we all understand, those of us who serve in Congress and all of the wonderful staff here, that we need the appropriations bills on the floor of the House to be passed by October 1 to keep the government running. I am beginning to think we are not going to do that this year and expect we will probably come up with a giant continuing resolution. But this is certainly a vamp until ready bill, and I certainly rise in opposition to it, because, in addition to everything else, it has a closed rule. The underlying bill is part of a continuing wave of election year gimmicks that the majority knows will never be signed into law. At a time when the body is woefully behind in the most basic task of passing bills funding the Nation's priorities, we should be using our time more constructively; but, instead, we are considering a resolution that shuts out consideration of a meaningful bipartisan substitute that would improve school facilities across the country. It does not have to be this way, Mr. Speaker. Surely expanding educational opportunities for our children would be an issue where this Congress could set aside its differences and work together. Education remains at the top of everyone's priority list, for rich and poor, Democrat and Republican, and any other category of persons. Instead, we have before us today a purely partisan bill, a bill that the minority leadership on the Committee on Ways and Means dubbed an embarrassment, and not a single member of the majority of the Committee on Ways and Means defended the substance of this bill when the gentleman from New York and others raised concerns about its uncertain and likely overly broad definition of eligible expenses. This measure will not improve the education of a single child, because it is designed to make a political point and not to become law. The problems with the bill are numerous. First, the legislation is the first step towards shifting funds away from public schools and into private and religious schools. This comes at a time when States are reeling from lost revenue and being forced to cut everything from teachers' salaries to laying off firefighters and policemen. We do not need to utilize the limited time of this body before adjournment debating another scheme to get the Federal Government to pay for private school tuition. Ninety percent of our children are in public schools, and those schools need our help drastically, now more than ever. I would also note that the $20,000 limit for singles and $40,000 limit for couples will not be enough to take advantage of the tax deduction, which is not refundable. Therefore, we are giving them absolutely nothing. Several months ago you recall we passed the No Child Left Behind Act that reauthorized the elementary and secondary education programs, and the congressional leadership and the President pointed with pride to the enhanced levels of education spending that were authorized in the legislation, and it was a fine bipartisan bill. But now the administration and leadership have allocated funds for that program for the next fiscal year, and they are $7 billion short. In other words, Mr. Speaker, many children will be left behind. And while they are supporting this bill, which is estimated to cost $5 billion, it seems to me that it would have been much better to have put this money into leaving no child behind. The substitute that the Democrats were attempting to offer would go a long way toward addressing the reversal. Mr. Speaker, we cannot expect our children to learn and our teachers to teach unless they are provided with safe and modern school buildings. Forcing students to go to school in trailers or dilapidated school buildings is a clear message to them that they do not matter, and surely we can do better. Currently our public school system has extraordinary unmet needs for funds to construct and modernize our schools. The new estimates based on data collected by the State departments of education indicate that more than $300 billion will be needed to repair or replace existing public school facilities. That $300 billion cannot be met without significant commitment of funds from all levels of government, including the Federal Government. The substitute we had hoped to have made in order would provide a meaningful down payment for school construction and modernization. In my home State of New York, it would have meant an infusion of close to $2.5 billion, incredibly needed money for school construction and rehabilitation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.","word.count":843,"sep11":1.02808988764045,"years":2002.88764044944,"days":2808,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.114377724709184,"Topic 2":0.0990070681074985,"Topic 3":0.0958238043073846,"Topic 4":0.430520635005662,"Topic 5":0.0336293171767647,"Topic 6":0.00974260419402723,"Topic 7":0.0206988244727651,"Topic 8":0.135778909843806,"Topic 9":0.0533147116036026,"Topic 10":0.00710640057930575},{"id":"10419950084273","body":"Dale Bumpers: '' Also transmitted is a section-by-section analysis. This legislative proposal is vital to American workers, offering them a meaningful and flexible opportunity to balance successfully their work and family responsibilities. The legislation would offer workers more choice and flexibility in finding ways to earn the wages they need to support their families while also spending valuable time with their families. In particular, the legislation would allow eligible employees who work overtime to receive compensatory time off--with a limit of up to 80 hours per year--in lieu of monetary compensation. In addition, the legislation contains explicit protections against coercion by employers and abuses by unstable or unscrupulous businesses. The legislation also would amend the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. This statute currently allows eligible workers at businesses with 50 or more employees to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave to care for a newborn child, attend to their own serious health needs, or care for a seriously ill parent, child, or spouse. Although enactment of this statute was a major step forward in helping families balance work and family obligations, the law does not address many situations that working families typically confront. The enclosed legislation would cover more of these situations, thereby enhancing workers' ability to balance their need to care for their children and elderly relatives without sacrificing their employment obligations. Under the expanded law, workers could take up to 24 hours of unpaid leave each year to fulfill additional, specified family obligations, which would include participating in school activities that relate directly to the academic advancement of their children, accompanying children or elderly relatives to routine medical appointments, and attending to other health or care needs of elderly relatives.

We have heard a lot about a compromise tonight. The party, of course, missing from this compromise is the administration. The President has told this body that he is strongly opposed to this bill and will veto it. I think that is something, when we talk about compromise and how there is peace in the valley, that we have to remember that there is something else that is going on here that is not really being fully explored tonight. What I am trying to do tonight, along with the gentleman from Illinois , and I am pleased that he has worked with me on an amendment, is to offer an amendment that really is a compromise, that tries to respond to what I consider to be some of the legitimate concerns that have been raised by radio station operators in this country, but at the same time, not to have Congress step in, strip the FCC of its authority, and micromanage microradio. Mr. Chairman, this debate is really the legislative equivalent of, your mother wears army boots. We have had fights for the last several months between the proponents of low power radio and the opponents of low power radio. They are fighting over a study. The FCC does not like the study that has been prepared by the industry. The industry says that the FCC has not done a good enough job in studying this issue. So they go back and forth, back and forth, yelling at each other. So the amendment that was offered by the gentleman from Michigan and the gentlewoman from New Mexico I think is a constructive amendment. It recognizes that in order for Congress to act intelligently on this issue, it has to have an independent study. I have no quarrel with that. I think it addresses the legitimate technical concerns that have been raised by people who run radio stations in this country. I say that as someone who is a strong supporter of low power FM radio. I want Congress to have an independent analysis of this issue. But this is where we separate, because the Barrett-Rush amendment makes one change and one change only to this bill. It would give Congress 6 months to act after the FCC submits its report. After 6 months, if Congress has not acted, the FCC may proceed with low power licenses. Why is this amendment important? The reason why this amendment is important is because we do not have a level playing field here. On the one hand we have the radio stations, who have made it very, very clear that, regardless of the outcome of this study, they oppose having any type of expansion to low power FM stations. On the other side we have the FCC, but the FCC really is speaking for groups that have no voice, by definition. They do not have radio stations. They do not have a powerful lobbying organization. They are the churches, the high schools, the neighborhood organizations. What the bill does in its current form is it says even if this independent study comes back and says there are no interference problems, even if there are no interference problems, the FCC cannot continue to do the job it has done for the last 80 years, which is to make sure that the spectrum is filled in a fair way. Instead, it says that Congress has to act first. I do not think there is a person in this room who believes that the opponents of low power FM radio are going to come back and say, okay, go ahead, change the law. Because even though we have this study here, the bill ultimately still builds a very strong fence. This is a ``fence me in'' bill. It says to those people who currently have stations, we are going to build this big fence around you and we are not going to let anybody else in. That is wrong. The people in this Chamber who say they are in favor of competition, the people in this Chamber who say they believe in advances in technology I think should say, wait a minute, wait a minute. We recognize if this study comes back and says that there are problems with interference, this Congress can act in a week. It is not going to take us 6 months. If there is a problem this Congress is going to act very quickly, because frankly, we are going to have powerful forces, just as we have powerful forces right now saying, quick, make sure there is no problem. If there is no problem, my concern is those same forces are going to come in and say, yes, well, maybe it does not show this, it does not show that, but we are still concerned about that. What this amendment does is it allows this bill to move forward. Under its current form, it is going to be vetoed by the President of the United States. I think we should be addressing the legitimate concerns, the legitimate technical concerns. That is why I am offering this amendment. We have two choices, we can go forth with this bill right now, face a certain presidential veto, or we can accept this amendment. I think the President and the Senate will say, all right, that makes sense. Of course we want to have an independent study. Of course we want the FCC to continue its role. But there is no reason in the world that Congress should be micromanaging these stations. I would bet, Mr. Chairman, that the radio stations themselves would rue the day that they wanted this Congress to get involved in the small, technical matters of the FCC. They do not want us to do that, generally speaking. They want us to stay out of it. But in this instance, they think that they can benefit. Mr. Chairman, this is a reasonable amendment. I certainly ask my colleagues to support it.","word.count":598,"sep11":-2.45505617977528,"years":1999.40449438202,"days":1568,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.013665821397875,"Topic 2":0.160017636801448,"Topic 3":0.00644569258571931,"Topic 4":0.0538443550478288,"Topic 5":0.0169256362251261,"Topic 6":0.00333827465399152,"Topic 7":0.0149750557920951,"Topic 8":0.350516191640621,"Topic 9":0.337614377636085,"Topic 10":0.0426569582192099},{"id":"10720010020421","body":"Billy Tauzin: Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time, and I rise in support of the motion by the gentleman from Ohio. It is not easy to do this, obviously, and it is difficult for all of us to be here because it seems like, on the surface, there was unethical, probably illegal, and certainly bizarre behavior, and we feel offended by this and we feel compelled to do something to prove that we are keeping our House in order. I am not an expert on the legal part of this case. I would not pretend to be, and the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct deserves the credit for the effort they went through to dig out the information. But the process disturbs me, and that is why I wanted to take a minute or two to talk about that. The point was made earlier that the House's conditions are a lot different than the legal conditions for guilt and, therefore, they are not as stringent. But we would not be here if Mr. Traficant had not been convicted, and so that is key. That is the important issue. And that trial bothers me. I do not accept it as a good, fair, legitimate trial. I do not think all the witnesses were heard that should have been heard, and I think some of the witnesses may well have been ``bribed'' into doing and saying certain things. But there is more that bothers me. I would like to see the appeals process completed. I was here in 1984, on my first tour of duty here in the House, and the George Hansen case came up and we voted then to convict. I think he had FEC violations and we voted to censure him. He lost his election, he lost his job, he lost his money, he went to jail and served time, and then he was exonerated on everything. He won all his appeals. I do not see the need to rush to judgment, certainly tonight. I am not happy that when the gentleman finally gets an opportunity to come and defend himself, he gets a total of 30 minutes. Really? And have my colleagues looked at the record of the case in Ohio? It contains a stack a foot high. Thirty minutes to defend himself? I do not think that is really fair. But there is another thing that bothers me, and that is the change of venue. I believe that the change of venue has been used historically in this country to make sure that the most horrible criminal gets a fair trial and gets his case moved from a area unduly influenced by media coverage. Have any of my colleagues ever heard of a trial being moved for the benefit of the State and to the disadvantage of the defendant? It may have happened, but I do not know about it, and I think that in itself is a reason to step back, take a look at this, and vote for the motion by the gentleman from Ohio. Mr. Speaker, many of Congressman Traficant's actions are impossible to defend. Mr. Traficant has most likely engaged in unethical behavior. I would hope all my colleagues would join me in condemning any member who would abuse his office by requiring his staff to pay kick-backs to him and/or do personal work as a condition of employment. I also condemn in the strongest terms possible using one's office to obtain personal favors for constituents, the people we are sent here to represent. Such behavior should never be tolerated. However, before expelling a member we must consider more than eccentric behavior and even ethical standards. Questions of whether the process of his court conviction and expulsion from Congress respected Mr. Traficant's constitutional right to a fair trail and the right to be represented of those who elected him to office, are every bit as important. Many Americans believe that Congress daily engages in ethically questionable and unconstitutional actions which are far more injurious to the liberty and prosperity of the American people than the actions of Mr. Traficant. Some question the ability of Congress to judge the moral behavior of one individual when, to take just one example, we manage to give ourselves a pay raise without taking a direct vote on the issue. Mr. Speaker, after carefully listening to last week's ethics hearing, I have serious concerns over whether Mr. Traficant received a fair trial. In particular, I am concerned over whether the change of venue denied Mr. Traficant a meaningful opportunity to present his care to a jury of his peers. Usually change of venue is instituted in cases where the defendant is incapable of receiving a fair trial. I am unaware of any case where the venue is changed for the benefit of the state. However, the most disturbing accusations concern the possibility that Mr. Traficant was denied basic due process by not being allowed to present all of his witnesses at the trial. This failure raises serious questions as to whether Mr. Traficant had the opportunity to present an adequate defense. These questions are especially serious since one of the jurors from Mr. Traficant's criminal trial has told the Cleveland Plain Dealer, that had he heard the testimony of Richard Detore at Mr. Traficant's trial, he would have voted ``not guilty.'' Mr. Speaker, I also question the timing of this resolution and the process by which this resolution is being brought to the floor. Mr. Traficant's conviction is currently on appeal. Many Americans would reasonably wonder whether the case, and the question of Mr. Traficant's guilt, can be considered settled, until the appeals process is completed. I fail to see the harm that could be done to this body if we waited until Mr. Traficant has exhausted his right to appeal. Prior to voting to expel Mr. Traficant before he has completed his appeals, my colleagues should consider the case of former Representative George Hansen. Like Mr. Traficant, Mr. Hansen was convicted in Federal court, censured by the Congress, and actually served time in Federal prison. However, Mr. Hansen was acquitted on appeal--after his life, career and reputation were destroyed. If my colleagues feel it is important to condemn Mr. Traficant before the August recess, perhaps we should consider censure. Over the past 20 years, this body has censured, instead of expelled, members who have committed various ethical and even criminal activities, ranging from being convicted of bribery to engaging in sexual activity with under- age subordinates. I am also troubled that Mr. Traficant is only being granted a half- hour to plead his case before the house. Spending only an hour to debate this resolution, as if expelling a member of Congress is of no more importance than honoring Paul Ecke's contributions to the Poinsettia industry, does no service to this Congress.

Lee Raymond, who was the retiring CEO of ExxonMobil, owns 7.7 million shares of their stock. Now, at the current dividend rate, he would generate, if he sold his stock today, $10 million. On top of that, he will have a $2.5 million tax cut. I think when we see that kind of disparity it has to pull at us that something is dreadfully wrong. Now, I am not upset with Mr. Raymond. I do not even know him. He may be a nice person. He may want to tithe to the church I pastored, but what I am concerned about is the fact that his total retirement package came close to $400 million, including his 7.7 million shares of stock. That is far more than one human being needs to earn, and I think that people who are earning $34,000, $45,000 a year are going to look at a $2.5 million tax cut for this gentleman and wonder about themselves. My final point that I have continued to make, as my uncle says sometimes I make the argument poorly, but it is that we cannot do everything. We cannot do everything. We cannot fight a war, $87 billion a year; we cannot fund all of the programs that people lobby you and me every day to fund; and we have used up every single nickel of the Social Security surplus. That is devastating, and we have got to come to grips with pay as we go, like all other Americans. If they want a refrigerator, they try to wait and pay for it. But what we have done is has been to demonstrate that to the people of the United States that the amount of credit they have, credit debt does not matter. In 2004, we saw the average credit card debt for Americans rise by 63 percent. Now, Asians save on an average of about 20 percent. The savings rate, Mr. Speaker, for the United States, this is embarrassing, is minus zero. We go on the other side. We are not saving any money at all. So the country looks at us, the Congress of the United States, we are spending wildly, and they have joined in. Because the American public is not saving, the government cannot borrow domestically. We are borrowing some domestically, but when we get ready for the heavy lifting, we are travelling around borrowing money from Caribbean Nations. I think that reeling in the tax cuts will allow us to address some of those other problems and reduce the amount of borrowing.","word.count":458,"sep11":4.99157303370786,"years":2006.85112359551,"days":4219,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0662682298898679,"Topic 2":0.208245451614002,"Topic 3":0.354616243514679,"Topic 4":0.00474153090533172,"Topic 5":0.0331173956359237,"Topic 6":0.160294966479381,"Topic 7":0.00343162765193613,"Topic 8":0.11705204255424,"Topic 9":0.0360773990746681,"Topic 10":0.0161551126799697},{"id":"10720010011257","body":"Dave Weldon: Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume I thank the gentleman from New York for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. Mr. Speaker, this is a fair and open rule for a noncontroversial bill. H.R. 4664, Investing in America's Future Act, will reauthorize the National Science Foundation, including an increase in funding for the NSF by 15 percent for each of the next three fiscal years. This increase will result in the doubling of the NSF budget over the next 5 years. NSF is a critical institution whose mission is to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity and welfare; and to secure the national defense. In doing so, NSF has worked with and funded research institutions all across the country. For example, NSF has granted over $311 million to Massachusetts last year, including $3.3 million to the Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and $1.9 million to the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth to fund very, very important projects that are vital to our national security and our national defense. This reauthorization bill was unanimously referred to the House by the Committee on Science. The funding level called for in this legislation is above the President's request, and it addresses the growing imbalance between Federal support of biomedical research and physical sciences research. It also helps to ensure that America's present and future scientists and engineers are globally competitive. The 21st century holds a great deal of promise, but there are also serious challenges ahead. Fortunately, the United States has some of the finest researchers and research institutions in the world. We must ensure that the scientific community in this country has the resources they need to meet our challenges. The bill before us today I think is an important step in that effort. Mr. Speaker, I commend the members of the Committee on Science for their bipartisan work on this important bill.

I am pleased to support H. Res. 523, recognizing the contributions of Historically black Colleges and Universities. Mr. Speaker for over a century, Historically Black Colleges and Universities have played an important role in providing opportunities for higher education to millions of African-Americans. Many of these colleges and universities were founded during the era of slavery or when American society was deeply segregated. Although social conditions have changed radically since these colleges and universities were founded, the HBCU's have remained committed to providing African-American students with superb educational opportunities. Almost 300,000 African Americans are currently enrolled in HBCU's, and among their alumni are Members of Congress, hundreds of elected officials, military officers, physicians, teachers, attorneys, judges, ambassadors, and business executives. I want to particularly call your attention to the key role that these institutions play in eliminating disparities in health care. The recent Institute of Medicine report, entitled ``Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care'', clearly demonstrated the need for more health care providers of racial, ethic and linguistic backgrounds to meet the need of our increasingly diverse population as one of its major recommendations. In the wake of anti-affirmative action movements across this country medical school enrollment in majority medical schools have dropped significantly over the last ten years. Were it not for minority health professional schools at our HBCU's the percentage of minority health care professional would be even less than the four percent currently represent across the different health professions. Another reason for our drop in health profession students is our poor and under-supported public school system. The worst public schools and the most ignored are in communities of color. As a result, our students graduate ill prepared for college. Only because of the commitment of our HBCU's to work with primary and secondary schools to improve student preparation and other programs designed by to remediate what is missing are our students given a chance to serve their communities in the critical area of health care and all of the others that are so important to improving our quality of life. The Subcommittee on National Parks and Public Lands on which I serve as the Ranking Democrat, earlier this year considered and passed H.R. 1606, which was introduced by my colleague Jim Clyburn and which I am proud to be an original cosponsor, to build upon the work started in 1996 with the passage of the historically black colleges and universities' historic preservation program. This program has been the catalyst for the preservation of historic structures at these institutions of higher education. Unfortunately, the program has used up all of its existing authorization of funds and while its accomplishments to date have been great, the work that still needs to be done is even greater. Many of the buildings that have been and will be assisted by this program are integral elements of the school campus and their preservation will not only preserve buildings but also the history and spirit of these pioneering institutions. To address this problem H.R. 1606 would authorize additional appropriations for historically black colleges and universities, to decrease the matching requirement related to such appropriations. I urge my colleagues to support passage of H.R. 1606 when it comes on the floor for a vote later this month. So I join my colleagues in recognizing these find institutions, especially the University of the Virgin Islands, in my district, for contributing immeasurably to all of our well-being. I thank and commend my colleagues, Congressman J.C. Watts and Eddie Bernice Johnson, for their leadership in bringing H. Res. 523 to the House floor.","word.count":652,"sep11":1.04494382022472,"years":2002.90449438202,"days":2814,"party":"Other","chamber":"","Topic 1":0.297863773765971,"Topic 2":0.0897575995675179,"Topic 3":0.0127267812913774,"Topic 4":0.00437478816962886,"Topic 5":0.0867123960689305,"Topic 6":0.14756597768895,"Topic 7":0.00284863419694276,"Topic 8":0.117462331389557,"Topic 9":0.0599377366000937,"Topic 10":0.180749981261032},{"id":"10419950016625","body":"Edward J. Markey: I agree, and I appreciate the remarks the gentlewoman has made, if I could just follow up on two points that she made. One is when I was at the senior center in Edison on Monday, one of the very first things the gentlewoman discussed was prescription drugs and the cost of prescription drugs, and how some seniors simply cannot afford to buy them or they will not get a refill if they need it. It is amazing to me, because when we talk to seniors when we are in our districts, these issues in many ways are very plain to them. Many of the seniors in the audience in Edison said to me, ``Well, Congressman Pallone, I don't understand. What Medicare should do,'' and this is almost a direct quote from one of the individuals, ``what Medicare should do is to be expanded to include preventive care.'' He talked about prescription drugs, because he said, ``A lot of times I go to the doctor and he prescribes a drug to me, and Medicare is covering the cost of the doctor visit but it is not covering the drug. So I get the prescription but I go home and I never fill it.'' What good is that? The point is that if Medicare were expanded to cover certain kinds of preventive care, like prescription drugs or like home health care visits, we would actually save a lot of money. We should be thinking of creative ways to expand Medicare, deal with prevention, and then save money in the long run. That is what I was kind of hoping we were going to be doing when we started to talk about Medicare in the beginning of this Congress. But, obviously, I was very naive, and I think I was naive because I did not understand what the gentlewoman brought up, the basic idea, which is that this Republican leadership, both in the Senate and here in the House, really does not like the Medicare program. They have an ideological problem with the Medicare program, and that is why we are getting these quotes from Speaker Gingrich saying that we will deal with it piece by piece and it will wither on the vine, or from the Republican presidential candidate saying that he is proud of the fact that when he was in the House of Representatives he did not vote for Medicare. They are not really interested in creative ways of trying to save money and expanding the money to help seniors. They just basically want it to go away. The other thing the gentlewoman mentioned and I thought was so important, she talked about the dangers of Medicare becoming a second rate health care system, and I think we have talked about that a little tonight. But there is also sort of a corollary to that, the notion of a divided system, sort of a class battle, if you will, between the wealthier seniors and the middle class or poorer seniors. I see that happening, for example, with Medigap. We mentioned that about half the seniors have Medigap and half do not. That means that a lot of seniors, even those who are on Medicare now, increasingly are not able to get certain kinds of health care services because they cannot pay out-of-pocket, because they do not have Medigap. So already we have a two-tiered system. Now, in this Republican budget, one of the things we did not mention tonight, but I think we should, is that they have brought up again the Medical Savings Accounts, the so-called MSA's, which I call the tax break for the healthy and wealthy. Basically what they are suggesting, and the gentlewoman knows is the case, is that seniors opt into a situation where they get catastrophic coverage. If something really terrible happens to them and they have to go to the hospital for a long stay, they are covered, but they are not covered for anything else. The money that the Federal Government puts up for Medicare, like a voucher, is put into some sort of savings account, and if they have to go to a doctor or they have something that only takes a relatively small degree of care, then they have to pay all that out-of-pocket. But if an individual has a very high deductible, or are essentially only covered for catastrophic care, the only people that will be able to afford that are the healthy and wealthy, so to speak, because they will say, ``Well, that is fine, I will opt for that.'' So what do we do? Once these medical savings accounts become part of the Medicare system, we will have a two-tiered system, in essence. The cost for those who do not have the MSA's will probably go up, because they will be the ones that have less money and are more of a burden on the system. So the cost of the system will go up. I know the gentlewoman has been very concerned about that issue, so if the gentlewoman wants to talk about that I would yield to her.","word.count":134,"sep11":-6.68258426966292,"years":1995.17696629213,"days":63,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.250496061056881,"Topic 2":0.173755863615843,"Topic 3":0.0199382338975143,"Topic 4":0.314644638345891,"Topic 5":0.00883387767810307,"Topic 6":0.0150835180629681,"Topic 7":0.0070073628516775,"Topic 8":0.183761670121424,"Topic 9":0.0188732904727749,"Topic 10":0.00760548389692381},{"id":"10820040053998","body":"Gordon Smith: Mr. President, in the elections of 1980 and 1984, the State of Oregon sent its electors to the electoral college to vote for Ronald Reagan. He was the last Republican to win the State of Oregon in a Presidential election, and he did so at a time of great peril both for my State and our country. When that occurred, America was in economic malaise, communism seemed to be in its ascendency, and America was struggling for leadership. Winston Churchill once said of a predecessor as British Prime Minister, ``He had had the misfortune to live in a time of great men and small events.'' When you think of where America was and where it ended after 8 years of the administration of Ronald Reagan, truly it can be said that all free men and women are better and freer, more prosperous and more at peace because Ronald Reagan was a great man called to a great time. As I contemplated what I could do in my small way to add some measure of tribute to the life of Ronald Reagan and to express to Nancy Reagan and her family my heartfelt condolences, I thought I should keep my words to a minimum and focus, instead, on the warm and wise words of President Reagan in his farewell address. It has been the practice of the Senate for the last 140 years that on or around the birthday of George Washington, a Senator is selected to read Washington's farewell address. I thought I would begin that tradition this day, with President Reagan's great speech, to come to the floor on or around President Reagan's birthday, and share his speech--or if one of my colleagues would like to do so, I would offer them the opportunity.

So with the Chair's indulgence, I will read the farewell address of President Ronald Reagan, given shortly before he left the Oval Office and George Herbert Walker Bush became the President.

I voted for both amendments because I believe that Congress can and should enact legislation to provide for safer schools and a secure learning environment. The language of Senator Boxer's Sense of the Senate stated that ``Congress shall make schools safe for learning by implementing policies that will reduce the threat of gun violence in schools''; I rise now to briefly explain a few of the wholly-attainable measures that I believe would truly make a difference. During the Juvenile Justice debate I offered a commonsense amendment that would allow local school districts to access existing funds available under the Safe and Drug Free Schools Act to conduct locker searches for guns, explosives, other weapons, or drugs. Mr. President, no one involved opposes cleansing our schools of these elements, other than those criminals who possess them; and to those few, I have no sympathy for any inconvenience these searches may cause. I am pleased that my colleagues supported my amendment, which was accepted by voice vote. I also suggest that Congress should build upon a current tax deduction and reward businesses that donate school safety devices to K- 12 schools. Qualified security equipment and technologies should include metal detectors, electronic locks and surveillance cameras. Along with these security improvements, I believe it is important to provide training for school personnel and parents on how to recognize a troubled young person before tragedy strikes. And in the event of an attack, our school officials, security personnel, parents and communities must be trained for emergency preparedness and crisis response. In that vein, I argue to my colleagues that we should allow ESEA funding available under the Safe &amp; Drug Free Schools and Communities program and the Innovative Education Program to be used for innovative approaches to reducing violence in schools and improving the classroom environment. Among other uses of such funding could be the testing of students for illegal drug use, at the request or consent of a parent or legal guardian; comprehensive school security assessments; purchase of school security equipment and technologies; implementation of a school uniform policy; and collaborative efforts with groups demonstrating expertise in providing research-based violence prevention and intervention programs. But the most important quality of these initiatives is that they would be initiated at the local level by those with the most knowledge of the community, not by some nameless Washington bureaucrat wielding a ``one-size-fits-all'' solution. Finally, I was pleased to have the opportunity to vote for Senator Durbin's amendment, which harkens back to a day when this country discussed issues of responsibility and society in a constructive manner, not in one based in fear or fantasy. Without question, we should educate our young people on right and wrong, and we must encourage constructive adult involvement in the lives of our young people, not only by parents and teachers, but also by community-based organizations, faith-based organizations, and local law enforcement personnel. Mr. President, I yield the floor.","word.count":509,"sep11":-1.56741573033708,"years":2000.29213483146,"days":1884,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.195811716738914,"Topic 2":0.035866955738584,"Topic 3":0.0118060608633682,"Topic 4":0.553691887252156,"Topic 5":0.00417735934874181,"Topic 6":0.00488614012520889,"Topic 7":0.0635028259769871,"Topic 8":0.0869328327767694,"Topic 9":0.0384597295436508,"Topic 10":0.0048644916356198},{"id":"10419960023328","body":"Peter Deutsch: Mr. Speaker, this is a bill that unfortunately we might look back in 5 to 10 years and say this is one of the most important pieces of legislation that this Congress will pass in this session of Congress.

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of this resolution. I commend the gentleman from Florida for introducing it, because it recognizes an important principle: We in government know that regulation, with the best of intentions, is not always successful. The charter school movement recognizes that empowerment of parents, teachers, and the children is almost always successful. That is the basic principle of the charter school movement. It engages the parents in setting the goals, it engages the faculty with the parents in setting the goals, and it asks for regulation waivers in return for the accountability for achievement and higher standards. In my district in Georgia, the first charter school in our State was approved, and it has subsequently been reapproved. The results are remarkable. The parents are proud, the kids are engaged, and the faculty is a part of the decision-making process, the change, and the reform that has made the school movement a success. So I commend the gentleman from Florida , I commend those parents, as the gentleman from Ohio has said, and I commend those around the country that are trying to help public schools with that key process of parental involvement and teacher involvement in higher goals and better achievement. Lastly, I want to add a comment. At our recess a few weeks ago, I traveled with USAID to Egypt and Ethiopia. In Ethiopia, I observed a program known as BESO, sponsored by Save the Children, CARE, World Learning, and USAID. It is a program that engaged, due to the following: It is basic educational structural overhaul. The result is, it is charter schools. There in Ethiopia, where we have problems with AIDS, problems with Muslim children being able to go to school, problems with economic development because of poor job training, we are bringing in parents, most of whom never had an education, to be part of the school with their children and the teachers to set goals. We saw children in the worst of impoverished situations achieving higher goals because their parents were involved, their government supported change, and because teachers, parents, and students were partners together. The resolution of the gentleman from Florida is a good one. The charter school movement is a tremendous asset to public education. I commend the gentleman from Florida for its introduction. I support the resolution.","word.count":405,"sep11":0.648876404494382,"years":2002.50842696629,"days":2673,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.709433534916552,"Topic 2":0.0924815580358586,"Topic 3":0.00462675755995804,"Topic 4":0.145533061440065,"Topic 5":0.0037381847074376,"Topic 6":0.00314181288074329,"Topic 7":0.00516521212458297,"Topic 8":0.00655410275936885,"Topic 9":0.0264088507465843,"Topic 10":0.00291692482884908},{"id":"10720020023434","body":"Barney Frank: Mr. Speaker, earlier this week my colleague, the gentleman from Worcester, Massachusetts, sponsored and the House passed and I voted for a resolution naming a post office in Worcester for a former colleague of many of us in the House, my colleague from Worcester's predecessor, former Representative Joseph D. Early. I first met Joe Early in 1972 when I, along with two of my current Massachusetts colleagues , was elected to the Massachusetts House. Joe Early was by then an established leader in the Massachusetts House. Two years later, he came here. I was proud to support him in his campaign to come here in 1974, and 6 years later I became a member of the House and so worked with him for the ensuing 12 years. I was very pleased to have a chance to join in naming that post office for him. I regretted the fact that I was not able to participate in the debate. I was tied up at a committee meeting. I thought I was going to be notified in time but to my error I came too late to make the debate so I am taking this special opportunity now because of my enormous respect for Joe Early and in particular for his extraordinarily strong understanding of what the role of government ought to be in our society. Joe Early, during his time in the Massachusetts legislature, during his time here, showed that you could be compassionate, that you should be concerned about the needs of people who would otherwise be left behind without in any way being soft on waste, without in any way being tolerant of sloppiness or unnecessary expenditure. Joe Early was a tough fiscal watchdog. On the Ways and Means Committee in the Massachusetts House and here on the Appropriations Committee, he was a man who paid a lot of attention to the specifics and was very, very tough on those who would waste public money. But he also understood that there were important values for the quality of our life that had to be met with public money. Time and again when it would be unpopular, when demagogic amendments would be offered on the floor of this House to make cuts of various sorts, Joe Early would be one of the few courageous enough to point out how damaging they would be, how irresponsible it was to take that easy approach as opposed to doing the kind of tough, ongoing work that he did of familiarizing himself with the programs for which he had legislative responsibility and fighting hard to make sure that they took effect. Those of us who knew Joe Early also were stimulated by his company. He was not, as people will remember who served with him, an unfailing dispenser of good cheer. If something was bothering you and you were looking for a smiley face, Joe was probably the last person on the continent that you wanted to encounter. But if you wanted serious conversation about our responsibility as an elected official, if you wanted to talk about both the strengths and the limitations of government, if you wanted to talk about how you actually use the machinery of government and public funds to try and accomplish important goals, then Joe Early would be very, very high on your list of people to consult. He was, in particular, interested in medical care. He was very proud of the first-rate complex at the University of Massachusetts Medical School that he represented, and the hospitals. He took on, to some extent, from Tip O'Neill, the great leader of the Massachusetts delegation, an interest in and an advocacy for the National Institutes of Health. Joe Early did as much as any man who served during that period to help America establish the position of leadership in health research, in providing the kind of resources that has done so much to improve the quality of human life. So now that Joe is in retirement, I want to just take this opportunity to express my appreciation to my colleague from Worcester , Joe Early's successor, for taking the initiative in naming that post office after Joe Early because it is as much as we can do to pay tribute to a man who understood as well as anyone what the job of being a Member of the United States House of Representatives entailed and who used to the fullest the powers of this job to make life better for the people of this country.","word.count":754,"sep11":1.04775280898876,"years":2002.90730337079,"days":2815,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0955951110361632,"Topic 2":0.040324497296119,"Topic 3":0.765264752606256,"Topic 4":0.0107135526276183,"Topic 5":0.0406132495320902,"Topic 6":0.0120564223430696,"Topic 7":0.00400064291425828,"Topic 8":0.0215000586145656,"Topic 9":0.00486693428617736,"Topic 10":0.00506477874368258},{"id":"10920050020087","body":"James Walsh: Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment to H.R. 5672, the Science, State, Justice, Commerce, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2007, offered by the gentlelady from New York that would lower the fees associated with the U.S. Small Business Administration's 7 loan program and ensure that the program continues as a public-private partnership. The 7 program is an important financing mechanism relied upon by entrepreneurs to gain access to lifeblood capital they need to strengthen, diversify, and expand their businesses and to hire new employees. Small businesses are particularly vulnerable to failure due to the difficulty in accessing capital, especially during a firm's formative stages. Most banks look upon making seed loans to small businesses as risky. Entrepreneurs, as a result, are left without the resources to afford to buy new equipment, hire new employees, and make other necessary operational investments in their businesses. These are the investments that are necessary to strengthen and grow businesses. The 7 program was designed and has been implemented specifically to address this gap in access to capital for American entrepreneurs. The program provides funding to underwrite loans made by local banks to small businesses. Funds provided through the 7 program relieved banks of the risks associated with lending to start-up small firms. In turn, small business gained access to important capital markets. Integral to the 7 program was the approximately $79 million provided annually to offset a large portion of the fees charged to small business borrowers associated with their loans. These fees are paid upfront during the loan process. These fees present small businesses, especially cash-strapped start-ups, with a potentially prohibitive cost to accessing capital. The Administration has zeroed out this aspect of the 7 program in its budget proposals for fiscal years 2005, 2006 and 2007. Entrepreneurs wishing to borrow under the 7 program now pay the full amount of the fees associated with their loans, raising the barrier to capital for at-need companies. In fact, small businesses on Guam paid $17,862 more in fee costs on the 57 loans made to them during fiscal year 2005. This is nearly $18,000 above what they would have paid during fiscal year 2004 on the same 57 loans. This additional amount is the direct result of the Administration cutting this aspect of 7 program funding. That is almost $18,000 dollars that small businesses in my district were unable to invest in equipment, training, salaries and other necessary operating costs. The amendment before us today would restore $40 million of the approximately $79 million previously needed to offset fees associated with loans made under the authorities of the 7 program. This amount would significantly reduce the amounts small business owners are paying to receive 7 program loans. This amendment would not, however, reduce fee amounts to fiscal year 2004 levels. The U.S. Small Business Administration budget has been reduced significantly under the current Administration. It is becoming increasingly difficult to find offsets within the lean U.S. Small Business Administration budget to pay for necessary amendments such as this one. Congress has shown bipartisan support for similar amendments in previous years. I urge my colleagues' support again this year. By supporting this amendment you will help ease the financial burdens on American small businessmen and women, so that they can continue their hard work driving our country's economy, producing innovative goods and services, and creating good jobs for America's talented workers. I urge my colleagues' support for the Velaquez amendment.","word.count":237,"sep11":3.89325842696629,"years":2005.75280898876,"days":3828,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.482452326076184,"Topic 2":0.386722444631496,"Topic 3":0.0136883911591796,"Topic 4":0.0230896750632275,"Topic 5":0.0262137356424535,"Topic 6":0.0120658329736276,"Topic 7":0.0126566709488522,"Topic 8":0.0160030015957146,"Topic 9":0.0195411806075204,"Topic 10":0.00756674130174353},{"id":"10820030046529","body":"Harry Reid: Mr. President, before my colleague from Iowa leaves the floor, I want to express my gratitude to the Senator from Iowa, as I did yesterday, for his support of the amendment offered by the Senator from Maine, Ms. Snowe, and me on the childcare provisions. It was a significant vote: 78 to 20 was the final vote. Certainly, the chairman of the Finance Committee, the Senator from Iowa, was tremendously helpful in that regard. I wouldn't want him to leave without once again expressing my sincere appreciation for his support. I have always been treated well by him. We have served together now for almost three decades in the Congress, and we have always had a strong and good relationship with each other. I was disappointed by the position of the administration. To quote them from their bulletin: ``Strongly oppose'' is an indication of how they fail to understand what I think the Senator from Iowa pointed out--certainly the Senator from Maine did--the critical transition that is necessary from welfare to work, particularly considering the jobs these people are able to get. Most of them are very low-wage jobs. Having a strong childcare component is the lifeboat that will get them from one side of the shore of this raging river to the other, the side of the shore from welfare dependency to work. If you cannot get across that gulf because you have young children, as many of these people do who are presently on welfare--trying to get to work, or those who work today barely holding on--then the likelihood they are going to succeed is very small. There was a strong vote in this Chamber yesterday to support the effort to provide the assistance for literally thousands of young children who are on waiting lists in 24 States that we know about, some 600,000 who will need that kind of assistance. I am terribly disappointed the administration strongly opposes childcare assistance. My hope is the position of this body will prevail in the conference, if we get there. I also want to comment briefly on the issue of the minimum wage. I thank our colleagues from California and Massachusetts who have raised it. The better description of this might be called a livable wage. We talk about the minimum wage, but what we are really looking for is a livable wage. It is a standard we have embraced for years. Administrations, regardless of party, have always embraced the idea of setting a floor of what ought to be a livable wage. It is hardly livable when you consider the poverty level for a family of three is $15,700 and we are talking about people making $10,700 a year working full time making minimum wage. That is $5,000 below the poverty level. I can't even imagine anywhere in the United States one could live today as a family of three with a gross income of $10,700. And that is what we are talking about. There are 34 million people who are living in poverty in the United States. In a nation of 280 million people, 12 million are children living in poverty. Obviously, we are not going to solve that problem simply by raising the minimum wage level, but we certainly want to give people a chance to be hired for a little more than $5 an hour in the 21st century. As we begin trying to move people from welfare to work so they at least have a chance, once they get that job, to hold on and then move into more independent living, they must be able to earn a livable wage. So I am terribly disappointed again that we have not been able to have a vote on this matter. I don't think it is terribly complicated. A livable wage in the United States, certainly in light of what happened since the last time we raised it, is in order--considering that every administration, from the most progressive to the most conservative, has found time and space in which to increase the minimum wage. This is one of the longest periods of time we have ever gone without increasing that. It has been 7 years since we have actually raised the minimum wage. During that same time, by the way, this body found room to increase our salaries six different times; six times we have raised our salaries. Yet, in 7 years, we have not increased the minimum wage. I have not objected to salary increases for Congress. I understand that. The point is, when we find time to debate and vote on matters that allow us on six different occasions to raise our salaries and not on one occasion have we been able to raise the minimum wage or the livable wage for people living in the levels of poverty they do, this is something I find rather distressing, to put it mildly. The great majority of welfare payments go to single mothers. Unfortunately, the kinds of jobs women leaving welfare find are often minimum wage jobs, making it very difficult, if not impossible, to sustain a family and meet the demands of raising children. Life is precarious for low-income people, particularly for single mothers raising children. In the U.S., regardless of whether they have been on welfare or not, for them, survival is a daily goal. If they work hard enough and their hours are long enough, maybe they can make ends meet, but only barely. They don't have time for their families because they are working tremendous hours, sometimes a couple of jobs to make ends meet. They are not buying homes, going on vacation, going to the theater, or symphonies, or buying extra clothes. They are trying to hold their families together. The idea of buying gifts for children, taking them on special trips, that is not part of the family's agenda if you are part of the 34 million people in this country living in poverty. We are trying to get that minimum wage after 7 years to a point that makes it possible to at least make it a little easier to meet the daily goal of survival. We must stop asking families to do it alone. They are working too many hours for too little pay. Often these children who are being raised in this environment are not entering our school system--particularly well prepared to learn. Talk to any teacher in any rural area where there is poverty, or to a teacher who works in our inner cities where poverty exists. Without exception, regardless of their politics, teachers will tell you children who are not getting the attention and time and care needed are starting their lives way behind. Ultimately, we pay a price in this country for that. I will not suggest to you the minimum wage solves all of those problems. But should we not in this great country, after 7 long years, provide an extra couple of dollars an hour so people might have a little bit more income to provide for their children. We need to help raise wages for these families so they can make ends meet and improve the quality of their lives. One of the best first steps is to ensure the work pays a fair, livable wage. The real value of the livable wage has fallen dramatically over the past 30 years. The livable wage workers are being left further behind every year. Working families have waited long enough. Minimum wage employees work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, and earn $10,700. That is if you work every week. Forget that 2 weeks vacation or even 1 week of vacation--you earn $10,700. This is the 21st century. In America, what community can you live in with a family of 3 on $10,700? I don't think you are going to find one. The poverty level is approximately $15,000 for a family of 3. We must raise the minimum wage to $7 an hour, and I think we can do it. Under the proposed bill, we go from $5.15 to $5.85 to, one year later, $6.45, and the year after that, to $7. That is what we are proposing. I suspect some negotiation might happen in order to get something done. But, we cannot even vote on the issue. Today, more than 34 million people live in poverty, including 12 million children. Among full-time, year-round workers poverty has doubled since the late 1970s, from 1.3 million then to 2.6 million in 2002. An unacceptably low minimum wage is a key part of the problem we are trying to solve. Every day the minimum wage is not increased, it continues to lose value and workers fall farther behind. Minimum wage workers have already lost all of the gains of the 1996- 1997 increase, 7 long years ago. Today, the real value of the minimum wage is more than $3 below what it was in 1968. To have the purchasing power it had in 1968, the minimum wage would actually have to be closer to $8.50 an hour than to $5.15, which is where we are today. In the past 7 years, salaries of lawmakers have gone up by $23,400, giving ourselves 6 raises, while minimum wage workers continue to earn $10,700 a year. Nearly 7 million workers would directly benefit from the proposed minimum wage increase 35 percent are their family's sole earners and 61 percent are women. Almost one-third of those women are raising children. An increase to $7 an hour for a full-time, year-round worker would add $3,800 to their income. What does that buy? If you are living in affluence, not much. But $3,800 for a minimum wage worker and their families means buying more than a year of groceries; 9 months of rent; a year and a half of heat and electricity in their homes; or full tuition for a community college degree. I know there are those who object to this increase and believe it is going to slow economic growth in the country. That is not true. Ever since there has been a minimum wage increase, there has been no ill effect on economic growth in the country. I suggest by doing this, there is a greater likelihood we are going to keep people in the workforce--even if they are minimum wage jobs--and allow them to provide the bare survival needs of their families, so they don't fall back into a dependency situation of one kind or another. I think we all become winners if we give these people a chance to have a higher standard of living than that which they are presently getting with the $5.15 an hour wage. I know it is not the job of the chairman of the Finance Committee to set the agenda. But somebody has to set the agenda ar","word.count":172,"sep11":1.45224719101124,"years":2003.31179775281,"days":2959,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0287985749374655,"Topic 2":0.528695703927204,"Topic 3":0.0404699832041837,"Topic 4":0.00846182094134585,"Topic 5":0.208853107769021,"Topic 6":0.00475810539027369,"Topic 7":0.00447334951022012,"Topic 8":0.0159688518626287,"Topic 9":0.023852442283471,"Topic 10":0.135668060174186},{"id":"10720010011173","body":"Darrell Issa: Madam Speaker, I rise in very strong opposition to the Export-Import Bank, and I do that as the ranking member of the Subcommittee on International Monetary Policy and Trade. Madam Speaker, there is growing anger and frustration in this country at the increasing greed and illegal activities in corporate America. The American people are sick and tired of CEO salaries in the tens of millions of dollars, in the hundreds of millions of dollars that are now on average 500 times greater than what the average American worker receives. The American people and workers are sick and tired of CEOs slashing pension programs and health benefits for their retirees while corporate profits are soaring. The workers of this country are sick and tired of corporate America shutting down American plants, throwing American workers out of the street and taking our jobs to China, to Mexico where desperate people are forced to work for 20 cents an hour. The American people are sick and tired of accounting gimmicks that cheat investors and employees. They are tired of CEOs setting up phony post office box companies in Bermuda so while the middle class pays more and more in taxes, CEOs and their corporations avoid their responsibilities in terms of taxes. And basically the American people are tired of corporate welfare. We are going to hear a whole lot in this body about making poor people responsible when it comes to corporate welfare. What about the CEOs and the major multinational corporations who get tens and tens of billions of dollars from the working families of this country? Some of my colleagues are going to tell us Export-Import Bank creates jobs, it does some good. Sure, it does. We give them a billion dollars a year, and we put at risk through loan guarantees some $15 billion a year; and if one sat out on a street corner and one gave away a billion dollars a year, he would also do some good. But the issue is are we getting value for the amount of money that we are spending, and the answer is obviously no. Madam Speaker, the outrage of the Export-Import Bank is that we are giving billions of dollars to the major job cutters in America. Yes, that is true. The largest corporations who come into Export-Import to get their corporate welfare laugh all the way to the bank because these are precisely the people who lay off American workers and then say, thank you, workers, for subsidizing our efforts. Let us look at these desperate companies that are getting the corporate welfare from Export-Import. It is Boeing, General Electric, Caterpillar, Mobil Oil, certainly in need of taxpayer support, Westinghouse, AT&amp;T, Motorola, Lucent Technologies, IBM, Enron. Enron getting helped from Export-Import. The irony here is that not only should the taxpayers of this country not be supporting profitable multinational corporations but the irony is we give them money and they say thanks, we are moving to China, we are moving to Mexico. General Electric, a major recipient of export import, we give them a lot of money. What is the result? From 1975 to 1995, GE reduced its workforce from 667,000 American workers to 398,000. Boeing, the same thing, huge job layoffs. Jack Welch, interestingly enough, the former CEO of GE, when he gets on the welfare line he said, ``Ideally what you would have is to put every company on a barge.'' In other words, what he says is thank you for the money; but we are going to go anyplace in the world where we can get cheap labor. In addition to its being corporate welfare, in addition to our, through Ex-Im, giving money to companies who have contempt for American workers, what also must be understood is that Export-Import is part of a failed trade policy. The United States trade deficit was $346 billion in 2001, and the trade deficit in goods was $426 billion. Let us wake up and understand that the permanent normalized trade relations with China is a failure. Yes, we gained some export jobs; but we are losing far, far more in terms of jobs being lost because companies have taken our jobs to China. Over the past 4 years we have lost a total of 2 million factory jobs, representing 10 percent of our manufacturing workforce. So the point here is Export-Import is part and parcel of a failed trade policy. Whether it is the most favored nation status with China, permanent normalized trade relations with China, NAFTA, that policy is failing. And it is time that we say we cannot continue to hemorrhage American jobs. Let me repeat. Under this great trade policy which Republican leaders talk about, some Democratic leaders talk about, corporate America and editorial boards say it is great; if it is so great, why between 1994 and 2000 have more than 3 million decent-paying manufacturing jobs been lost? In 2001, the manufacturing sector lost 1.3 million jobs. In my own State of Vermont, a small rural State, small plant after small plant after small plant is closing down because they cannot compete against imports coming in from China where workers are being paid 20 or 25 cents an hour. And it is time that this body finally said enough is enough. Yes, we get millions and millions of dollars from corporate America for our campaigns; yes, that is great that they come to $25,000-a-plate fund-raising dinners. But what about the workers in rural Vermont, in California, in Illinois, in Ohio, who have lost their jobs? Maybe somebody should stand up for them. What about the high school graduates who used to be able to go out in the workforce and get a manufacturing job and make a living wage who today flip hamburgers at Burger King or McDonald's. Maybe they need a decent job even if they cannot contribute huge sums of money to this institution in terms of campaign contributions. Our trade policy is a failure. Ex-Im is part of that trade policy. Let us defeat it for that reason. Let us end corporate welfare. Where are all of my conservative friends who want a balanced budget? Do you really want to give a billion dollars a year to some of the largest, most profitable corporations in America? There are many reasons to defeat Ex-Im, but it is time that we stood up for the American taxpayer. It is time we stood up for the American worker.

I must say, I am extremely pleased the Republican leader came to the floor this morning and propounded this amendment to stop what I have watched over the last week--at best, journalistic silliness and a tremendous effort to distort what are, in fact, facts and realities as it relates to certain processes that have gone on and are still going on at the Department of Agriculture. When I read headlines in the New York Times that suggest--and they did--``Let Them Eat Poison, Republicans Block a Plan That Would Save Lives,'' I say that is in fact a knowledgeable and outright distortion of the facts as we know them and certainly as this Senator knows them. So, for the next few moments I would like to relate to you some unique experiences I have had serving on the Senate Agriculture Committee that have dealt directly with the issue of the E. coli bacteria and what this Congress and this administration has attempted to do and, in some instances, has failed to do. First, I want to talk about how they are playing fast and loose with the [[Page S 9688]] facts with, in my opinion, a direct effort to generate public attitude, and, in this instance, the attitude would be one of fear. Second, I want to talk about this administration, what it can do, if it is sincere in helping improve food safety, with or without S. 343. And I want to show it is flatout wrong to claim that this bill, S. 343, and all of the proceedings to it, along with this amendment, are going to do one single thing to damage food safety in this country. Madam President, we take for granted, in the United States, that we have the safest food supply in the world--and we should take it for granted because we do. We are indisputably a nation that places before its consuming public the safest of all food supplies. Let me suggest that, when I make that statement, I do not suggest that all food is, on all occasions, absolutely, every day, totally safe. New regulations do not save lives; safe food processes save lives. And it is phenomenally important for us to remember that the responsibility of safe food lies with everyone involved, in production--that is the one side we are talking about, because that is where the rules and regulations are--and on the consumption side, and that is where you and I and all other consumers, Madam President, have a responsibility. Here is an interesting statistic that has been ignored by the press even though they know it. From 1973 to 1987 the Centers for Disease Control, which I think has credibility, reported that 97 percent of foodborne illnesses were attributable to errors that occurred after meat and poultry leave the plant; in other words, leave the processing plant, the slaughterhouse, the preparation plant, the packing area, if you will, however you wish to describe it; 97 percent of all foodborne illnesses are attributed after that. Yet, the debate today, and the foolish rhetoric in the press, has been on the other side of that issue. Why have they missed the point? How could they come to be or appear to be so ignorant to the fact? Is it because they want it to be? Is it possibly because they want to distort the basis of the debate and the arguments behind why this Congress is moving S. 343? Most foodborne illnesses can be prevented with proper food handling or preparation practices in restaurants and in home kitchens. Observers this afternoon might say this Senator has a bias. He comes from a life in the cattle industry. Madam President, my bias does not exist there because when the debate on E. coli began 2\\1/2\\ years ago--I come from a beef-producing State. But we had young people in our State growing ill, and in one instance a near death, because of a contaminated hamburger eaten at a fast food restaurant in my home State of Idaho. So I was clearly caught in the middle of this debate. I, working along with the then Secretary Espy, began to move rapidly to try to solve this problem because it was an issue whose time had come and it was important that the Congress of the United States face and deal with food inspection in this country when they had in fact failed for years and years to do so. So let me suggest to you that one of the arguments that has to be placed before the American consumer is simply this: True methods that transcend generations of Americans, whether we inspect the way we inspect or whether we regulate the way we regulate, or whether we change the rules of the cause and effect, the bottom line is you cook your meat and your poultry thoroughly. And if there is an example--and there is argumentatively statistics today--that suggest there is an increase in E. coli poisoning and bacterial poisoning, I believe it is because the consuming public no longer has the knowledge or has not gained the knowledge that you have to prepare your food properly. They just expect the Government to put on the plate every day and at all times safe food. Let me suggest to the person who is the preparer of food--and that is all of us--that you just do not pop it in the microwave. You had better learn that food that is improperly prepared can in fact be life- threatening on occasion, if you mishandle it. And in 97 percent of the cases between 1973 and 1989 that was in fact the fact. I do not think that any of us today should be confused by the playing or the gamesmanship that has gone on with this issue. To the critics that claim that Government should bear all the responsibility of food safety, I think you can tell by my expression this afternoon that I just flatly disagree. However, I do want to make one point. The administration has had the authority to address any food safety issues and in my opinion has not delivered. They have worked at it for 2\\1/2\\ years. What happened? When an industry pleads with them to bring on new regulation because the appearance of food that is not safe damages the reputation of the industry, it obviously causes great concern to the consumer. Yet, this administration has stumbled repeatedly inside USDA to bring about a new set of standards and regulations that the industry placed before them and said, Please do it. Please bring about processing that results in a regulatory effort that will cause in all appearances and hopefully in reality safe food. Why has it not happened? Why are we still generally operating under a standard that was put in place in 1906? Is it because of the political interests? Is it because of the tug and pull of a labor interest that simply said, ``We will not give up our featherbedding and our employees for a safer, more scientific process?'' Oh, yes. Madam President, that is part of the debate that somehow we wanted to quietly skirt around when in fact it is fact, and that is why the food safety and inspection service in our country has been locked in a static environment since 1906, unwilling to move with the times and unwilling to move with the science of today. But today's challenges are microbiological in nature. It is not a matter of sight. It is not a matter of inspecting because of an animal disease whether meat appears to be safe or it is not safe. It is really now a question of science. It is a question of bringing on line a technique that we all know exists out there. It is called HACCP. It is called hazardous analysis and critical control point. These are the issues at hand, Madam President. That is why we are here debating today. Is there blame to cast around? Oh, yes, there is. But blame should not rest with this legislation. Blame should rest with past Congresses and past administrations that were unwilling to bring on line the kind of scientific food inspections that our country and our consumers deserve today. I hope the Dole amendment will take away from this debate the kind of gamesmanship that was clearly going on in the press of this country because I think it ought to be stopped. My guess is the vote today will do so. Opponents of regulatory reform claim it endangers health and safety-- especially in the area of food safety. I am here to set the record straight. First, I want to talk about how they are playing fast and loose with the facts, to generate public fear. Second, I want to talk about what the Clinton administration can do if it is sincere about helping to improve food safety. Third, I will show that it is flatout wrong to claim this bill will do anything to endanger food safety. We take for granted that in the United States of America we have the safest food supply in the world. New regulations do not save lives. Safe food processes save lives. The responsibility for safe food lies on everyone involved in the production and consumption. For the time period from 1973-87, the Centers for Disease Control reported that 97 percent of foodborne illnesses were attributable to errors that occur after meat and poultry leaves the plant. Most foodborne illness can be prevented with proper practices in restaurants and home kitchens. The best way to ensure that food is safe is a tried and true method that transcends the generations: Cook your meat and poultry thoroughly. The basic rule of thumb is that meats should be cooked until the fluids run clear and the internal temperature has reached 160 degrees Fahrenheit. Unfortunately, that lesson has not always been heeded. In my grandmother's scrapbook there is an article detailing the death of a family of six near Cambridge, ID, due to improper food preparation. This unfortunate occurrence took place in 1929. As you can [[Page S 9689]] see, the issue of food safety is not a new one. The food preparer and consumer always have and still must accept ultimate responsibility for food safety. Unfortunately, that responsibility, along with all others in this life, occasionally bears a consequence. To the critics that claim the Government should bear all responsibility for food safety--I must disagree. However, I want to point out ","word.count":2296,"sep11":-6.3314606741573,"years":1995.52808988764,"days":188,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.67866904271939,"Topic 2":0.183376781213,"Topic 3":0.00986578048694855,"Topic 4":0.0706033423018261,"Topic 5":0.0107935341833799,"Topic 6":0.00724524401326137,"Topic 7":0.00681859289097674,"Topic 8":0.0165855778841393,"Topic 9":0.0102511053356568,"Topic 10":0.00579099897142079},{"id":"10620000022645","body":"Marcy Kaptur: Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for yielding me the time. I want to say that it is a great pleasure for me to rise today as we bring our bill to the floor, the fiscal year 2001 appropriation for Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies. I want to also begin by saying that this is the last bill that will be managed by my dear friend and colleague, the gentleman from New Mexico , as chairman of the subcommittee because his limited subcommittee chairmanship has been reached under current House rules, which I certainly would like to change. He is and has been such a leader, a fine gentleman in the true sense of the word, a caring chairman, an advocate for America's farmers and ranchers, and a true friend to every single Member of this institution. So I wanted to acknowledge his hard work on this bill. It has been a joy to work with him, and I number these days and years among the most memorable of my own life. I also want to thank the subcommittee staff: Hank Moore, Martin Delgado, John Ziolkowski, Joanne Orndorf; and our detailees: Anne DuBey and Maureen Holohan; and to the minority staff leader David Reich; and Roger Szemraj of my own staff, for all the hard work that has gone into putting this bill together. Let me begin by saying that I come to the floor rather conflicted this morning. This is a very, very important bill and one that we will focus on today. But we have just learned that, contrary to an agreement that was reached yesterday, the majority has chosen to place the sanctions language dealing with Cuba and Libya, the issue that we debated for hours here yesterday, into the supplemental appropriation bill, contrary to an agreement that had been reached with the minority. This is creating a great disarray that I think threatens not just this bill but the supplemental and its ability to move through the Congress and, also, to be signed by the President. There are many programs in there, such as firefighting and so forth, that are needed immediately in the western part of the country. I would just urge the Majority to remove that sanctions provision from the supplemental legislation. This is a violation of an accord that had been reached with the minority, and it truly places us in a most difficult position as we proceed forward with this bill today. Now, let me say that this bill deals with the basics of life that touch every American every day, have already touched every one of us as we awakened this morning, the food that we have eaten, the fiber that we wear, the fuel that we use to move vehicles and in industry, and forest production, all the land and water conservation programs that cover the vast majority of private lands in this country, the stewardship of those lands and the help that goes to those landholders is contained in this legislation. The food that we ate this morning no doubt was influenced in millions of different ways by the research that has been supported over the years through the U.S. Department of Agriculture. All the marketing programs, the safety that we felt when we ate that food, that the milk was okay and that it was very healthy to eat, the various medicines that we take, our certainty that that medication will do what it says and if there is a side effect that it is labeled. All of the Food and Drug Administration programs come within our jurisdiction. So this is a very important bill that goes to the center of life in America. And we hope by our example that we can influence the world's people as well. The bill's spending level is at about a level of $75.3 billion. Nearly a little more than 80 percent of that, or $60 billion, is what we call mandatory spending, money that we have for important programs like the Commodity Credit Corporation reimbursements that are central to the operation of our farm assistance programs to those who produce that food, fiber, and forest product. So there is $27.7 billion in the bill that goes to that major segment of this proposal. The Food Stamp program, which helps those who cannot afford to feed themselves in this country, $21.2 billion contained in this bill. An even more important program as Welfare to Work locks in across this country and our feeding kitchens and elderly feeding programs and so forth become short changed. Our School Lunch program, $5.4 billion, so that every child in this country will have decent food at least during the week while they are in school, $5.4 billion, and $1.5 billion for the School Breakfast program so those little urchins out there, their brains grow and, as they go to school, they are able to lead healthy lives and that they grow properly. Our conservation programs, nearly a billion dollars here, working with all the private owners of America to make sure that the land and the water and the ditches and the runoff is handled properly. We are making progress there, but we certainly have a long way to go. This is an incredible piece of legislation. Of the total amount of spending, $75.3 billion, the discretionary amount, the part our committee struggles with so greatly, $14.5 billion is, unfortunately, $400 million below the spending of the current fiscal year. This is a very tight bill, hard choices had to be made. In fact, the entire bill is $400 million below this year's spending when we discount the nearly $8.7 billion that was provided in emergency assistance last year. Now, I said that this bill came forward under difficult circumstances. The most recent nick, however, being the fact that the sanctions language was put into the supplemental against the will of the minority and against the agreement that was reached. The allocation we were given by the Committee on the Budget makes it difficult to detail with responsible priorities submitted by the administration. We are at least $1.6 billion in this proposal under the administration's request for all programs and, as I mentioned, $400 million under last year. If we look at what was done in the supplemental, which is linked to this bill directly, there was nearly $400 million in the supplemental that we were expecting to help cushion the cuts and the lack of full support in this bill, and we were told yesterday that that has now been reduced by $204 million, which means that there is only about $195 million left in the supplemental, which absolutely underfunds these programs at a time when rural America is just caving under the continuing low price situation, the drought, the high water levels in other parts of the country. To be underfunding agriculture at a time when rural America is in recession makes absolutely no sense to this Member. Now, the bill, as best as we were able to try to fund programs that are so necessary, does have some additional problems. For example, in the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, we do not provide the resources requested by the President. In fact, we are $53 million below his request for funds to deal with the growing infestation in this country by invasive species, other pests, and viruses. For example, in the area of citrus canker in Florida where entire orange and lime crops are threatened, we do not have funding sufficient to deal with the eradication nor with trying to prevent further spread of that particular problem. The same is true with Pierce's disease in California. The Administration released about $12 million this past week, but that is not sufficient to deal with the vineyard problems all throughout California. Plum pox in States like Pennsylvania, which are affecting our fruit crops, all of these dollars that were proposed by the minority to try to deal with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service have not been fully provided. I can tell my colleagues that failure to deal with these pests and failure to deal with prevention will mean costs in the future of billions and billions and billions of dollars to deal with something like the Asian Longhorn Beetle, which is destroying our hardwoods in Chicago and in New York. This is not an insignificant issue. It has long-term consequences. There are cuts in this bill, unfortunately, for the Food for Peace program $37 million below the President's request. We keep saying that access to foreign markets is what will help our farmers recover from low prices, but at the same time we disarm ourselves by failing to provide the level of resources we need to get the job done and move our product into other markets, certainly when we have a surplus, to those people in our country and around the world who remain hungry and in fact in many quarters of the world that are starving. In this bill also we fail to adequately fund or place restrictions on the use of funds to deal with the problems faced by the most needy and the most powerless people in our country. For example, there are insufficient funds in this bill for the 1890 colleges, those colleges that have been dealing with those historically discriminated against in our society, as we try to spread the knowledge of the Department of Agriculture in all of its different aspects throughout the university and college systems of this country. Further, the bill prohibits further expansion of the Colonias initiative to deal with the tremendous pollution at the southwestern border of Mexico with Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. So there is no additional funding in the bill for that important effort. Finally, if we think about our food programs in general, the underfunding is largely in the area of food programs, certainly food stamps, our school breakfast, our school lunch, our elderly feeding programs, the Women Infants and Children feeding program. Totally, the funding in this bill is about a billion dollars under the administration's request. On the conservation front, which is so important to us, as the most productive land on Earth, the conservation programs are $65 million below the President's request","word.count":2187,"sep11":-1.23314606741573,"years":2000.62640449438,"days":2003,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0373795344340868,"Topic 2":0.0259789757935354,"Topic 3":0.0119084436842855,"Topic 4":0.00367506383023372,"Topic 5":0.0936091235871629,"Topic 6":0.426631507829829,"Topic 7":0.017213357739826,"Topic 8":0.335914357248209,"Topic 9":0.0426180004504062,"Topic 10":0.00507163540242621},{"id":"10920060005439","body":"Dan Boren: Thank you, Congressman Ross. Mr. Speaker, you know it is not very often that I come to this floor to speak on an issue. As a freshman Member, sometimes we don't come down and talk about issues on this floor. But I think it is very important tonight that we talk about this budget because budgets are a statement of our priorities. I am going to talk tonight a little bit about rural America. I also want to talk a little bit about our Nation's veterans. For those of you all who have never been to Oklahoma, I am going to tell you a little bit about my district. My district is in eastern Oklahoma. I represent 25 counties of a very rural part of the United States. The largest community in my district is Muskogee, Oklahoma, population 38,000 people, where my wife, Andrea, and I reside. There are towns like Broken Bow and Idabel and Miami and Sallisaw, Wapanucka, Bromide, Bluejacket, some of the best people in the world. And let me tell you, this budget does not help my folks back home. I think it is very important that we reduce the national debt and we balance our budget, but we can't do it on the backs of rural America. Once again, this year the President's budget slashes rural development programs. It freezes funding for rural education and phases out our rural health care grants. In my district, it abolishes the COPS grant program which is responsible for putting over 200 officers on the street in eastern Oklahoma. We have a real meth problem in eastern Oklahoma. We have a terrible meth problem. We had a lot of meth labs that were popping up and actually we are doing a lot about that. But we need more cops on the street. This budget cuts 200 police officers. My good friend, my colleague from Arkansas, Mr. Ross, mentioned cuts in our ag research centers. Folks, 2 weeks ago I was in Lane, Oklahoma. There is a research center, the Wes Watkins Lane Ag Research Center, employs a lot of folks in my district, has a $3 million impact on the local economy. We are talking about salaries, 70, $80,000 salaries. These are big salaries in my district. In the President's budget that facility is set to close. And I know I am going to be working with my colleague from Arkansas to help stop that. Here is another couple of statistics. It cuts assistance to rural manufacturers and small businesses by nearly 60 percent. In the State of Oklahoma we lost over 80,000 manufacturing jobs over the past 2 years. And we are talking about taking those investments away from small businesses. We need help in rural Oklahoma. It also cuts rural health care by 83 percent, and not just in rural America, not just in rural Oklahoma. It also affects all of our veterans. I have got a big Veterans Hospital in my district in Muskogee, Oklahoma. And I get a chance to visit with our veterans all the time. And they talk to me about the TRICARE program. One example in this budget is an increase in co-pays and enrollment fees for military retirees in the TRICARE program. So this country is saying to you, you go, you enlist in the service, you spend 20 years supporting the flag, going overseas, fighting for our freedoms, and we are going to cut your benefits. That is a wrong priority, and we won't stand for it. Another thing we have got to think about when we are talking about cutting these programs like TRICARE. Folks, we are facing a recruitment problem right now. We are trying to get more and more young people to join the military. How can we tell those young people to join the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines, how can we tell them to join when we are going to cut their benefits? There is a direct correlation to what we are doing in this budget to our Nation's Armed Forces. And I stand as a Blue Dog, someone that believes in fiscal accountability. But, at the same time, we have got to make sure that we defend those priorities. And I stand with my colleague from Arkansas. I know we are going to have a few other speakers here in a minute. And with that I am going to yield back to my colleague from Arkansas. And I thank him for allowing me to be a part of this program. As I mentioned before, I came down as part of the 30-something and gave a few talks, and I rarely come down. But this budget got me so upset, thinking about the people back home in Oklahoma, that I wanted to come to this floor and talk about these priorities. And with that I yield back to my friend, Congressman Ross.","word.count":818,"sep11":4.67977528089888,"years":2006.5393258427,"days":4108,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.370303330504412,"Topic 2":0.0305702213366429,"Topic 3":0.0130239435695216,"Topic 4":0.0706371747293821,"Topic 5":0.367850078051419,"Topic 6":0.00359262965124023,"Topic 7":0.010384438576305,"Topic 8":0.105030746545712,"Topic 9":0.0179815876679231,"Topic 10":0.0106258493674427},{"id":"10720010009475","body":"Jennifer Dunn: Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 165, which expresses the sense of the Congress that research and education on fibroid tumors be increased. This resolution was unanimously approved by the full Committee on Energy and Commerce on April 24. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution, which will help place a much-needed focus on fibroid tumors and their prevention. As a firm believer in prevention, I am pleased that this resolution places such an emphasis on providing women with the information they need to make smart decisions about their health. For example, fibroid tumors are linked to diets rich in fatty foods. Women need this important information so they can modify their eating habits to reduce their risks of developing fibroid tumors. The vast majority of fibroid tumors occur in women of reproductive age. Today, a hysterectomy is the most common treatment for women with fibroid tumors. This procedure has devastating consequences for women as they are unable to have children, as we know, after a hysterectomy. The resolution calls on the medical community to explore alternatives to hysterectomies for the treatment of fibroid tumors. We must focus research efforts on the development of alternative therapies that will increase the treatment options for women. Therapeutic advances are the surest way to enable women to receive care and preserve their ability to bear children. I would like to thank the gentlewoman from California for her good work on this issue, and I urge my colleagues to support H. Con. Res. 165. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD.. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that today the House is considering my bill, H. Con. Res. 165, which deals with uterine fibroid tumors. I want to express my gratitude to the House leadership and to the gentleman from Louisiana and the gentleman from Florida of the Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Subcommittee on Health. My thanks also to the ranking members, the gentleman from Michigan and the gentleman from Ohio and my dear friend, the gentleman from California , for their efforts to bring this measure to the floor for consideration. I also want to recognize the respective majority and minority committee professional staff for their work. This resolution, Mr. Speaker, expresses a sense of Congress that continual research and education must be directed to the causes and cures for noncancerous uterine fibroid tumors. These tumors afflict women of reproductive age and affect African-American women 2 to 3 times more frequently than other women. Although the tumors are usually benign, they are quite painful, troublesome and dangerous, depending upon their size and their location. It has been estimated that 20 to 30 percent of women experience fibroid tumors, even though many of the cases are not diagnosed. Although these tumors can be quite small, they can multiply and cause great physical discomfort. For many years a surgical procedure known as a hysterectomy, the removal of the uterus, has been used to eliminate the tumors. This surgery unfortunately also eliminates a woman's ability to have children. Therefore, it is imperative that women become more educated about the nature of fibroid uterine tumors and the possible implications for women who suffer from this debilitating health problem. The best approach for women to effectively deal with this unique health dilemma involves regular exams by their doctor. Furthermore, it is paramount that the medical community explore alternatives to eliminate recurring fibroids by other than a woman having to undergo a hysterectomy. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that H. Con. Res. 165 has been brought before the House for consideration. For much too long women have suffered terribly with uterine fibroid tumors. I applaud my colleagues for bringing this bill before the House for a vote. This legislation, when enacted, will be implemented to encourage women to seek early detection of uterine fibroid tumors and will further enable doctors to pursue research concerning better treatment to avoid unnecessary and painful surgery. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.","word.count":530,"sep11":-0.306179775280899,"years":2001.55337078652,"days":2333,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.206291580922553,"Topic 2":0.388255249802442,"Topic 3":0.0301235008573329,"Topic 4":0.177524759389524,"Topic 5":0.0365051029871097,"Topic 6":0.0296066825069368,"Topic 7":0.0193285640493113,"Topic 8":0.0589257696171524,"Topic 9":0.0338429503998435,"Topic 10":0.0195958394677944},{"id":"10720020018419","body":"Speaker: UDALL of Colorado.

As we in Colorado are all too aware, the combination of serious drought conditions and the results of a century's policy of suppressing all fires on federal lands has produced a series of extreme wildfires that have threatened the lives and property of thousands of people in our state and elsewhere. As a result, the Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, and other federal land-managing agencies have exhausted the funds budget for firefighting and have had to divert money from other important purposes to respond to the emergency conditions. That was why last month, along with my Colorado colleagues, Representative Hefley, Representative DeGette, and Representative Tancredo, and my cousin, Representative Tom Udall of New Mexico, I wrote to Chairman Young and Mr. Obey, urging that the agencies be provided with emergency supplemental firefighting funds. I thought then--and still think--that the best way to accomplish this would be to include the funds in the conference report on the emergency supplemental bill already passed in both Chambers. However, I understand that the Administration opposes that idea and therefore as an alternative the money has been included in this bill. I certainly support that, although I am concerned that the result may be to unnecessarily delay the provision of these vitally-needed funds to the agencies. I also want to express my appreciation for inclusion of the bill of $4 million to enable the Forest Service to continue acquiring lands in the Beaver Brook area of Clear Creek County, in Colorado's Second Congressional District. This tract encompasses almost the entire watershed of Beaver Brook, which flows into Clear Creek. the city of Golden originally acquired the lands as a potential source of water. However, it now wants to sell the lands so it can use the money for pressing municipal needs. The Beaver Brook lands, nearly 6,000 acres in all, are important elk habitat and include pristine riparian areas and ponderosa pine stands that are comparatively rare in this part of Colorado. The tract also is a key part of a corridor of open and undeveloped lands linking the alpine terrain of the Mount Evans Wilderness with the foothills and piedmont of the Front Range area. In short, these lands provide scenic, recreational, and wildlife resources that are important to all Coloradans, and it is very important that they remain undeveloped-- especially because our population growth is leading to increasing development throughout this part of the state. The City of Golden--the property owner--is willing to sell the lands to the federal government so they can be added to the national forest. Clear Creek County, where the lands are located, also supports that acquisition, and the Forest Service has identified it as a high regional priority. The acquisition is also supported by a wide range of other individuals and groups in Colorado--and here in Washington, Representative Tancredo and I have been working together on the idea as well. Last week, I had the pleasure of attending a ceremony marking transfer of part of the lands to the United States for inclusion in the Arapaho National Forest. The funds provided in this bill will help maintain momentum as we move toward completion of this important acquisition. The bill also includes a number of other items of particular importance to Colorado, including money for construction work at Rocky Mountain National Park and the Great Sand Dunes National Monument, funds to make the land acquisition that will set the stage for upgrading the Great Sand Dunes to National Park status, and funds for important work to further the protection of endangered species and the sound management of our natural resources. Of course, no bill is perfect. But this bill is a good one and I urge its passage.","word.count":727,"sep11":0.867977528089888,"years":2002.72752808989,"days":2751,"party":"Other","chamber":"","Topic 1":0.0839224568779311,"Topic 2":0.0595039478430047,"Topic 3":0.437685194915155,"Topic 4":0.0594150762288087,"Topic 5":0.0174754382199017,"Topic 6":0.329126343027618,"Topic 7":0.00224220476368439,"Topic 8":0.0042057501037239,"Topic 9":0.00508505912200547,"Topic 10":0.00133852889816657},{"id":"10619990023612","body":"Charles Stenholm: Mr. Chairman, earlier this year, working with the House Committee on Government Reform's minority office and the gentleman from California , the gentlewoman from New York and myself conducted a study of the cost that seniors in our congressional districts pay for their prescription drugs versus the cost paid by their counterparts in Canada and Mexico for the exact same drugs. Both the gentlewoman from New York and I were startled by the results, to say the least. We found that seniors in our districts in New York pay, on average, 91 percent more than seniors in Canada and 89 percent more than seniors in Mexico for the exact same drugs; twice as much for the exact same drugs, same dosage, same in every way, expect price. We did not study arcane drugs not used in the real world to skew our data, but rather the 5 most popular prescription drugs sold to seniors in the U.S. today: Zocor, Prilosec, Procardia, Zoloft, and Norvasc. Let me put it in perspective. I have a constituent in Long Island City, New York who has to purchase 100 capsules of Prilosec every 3 months for his wife. He pays almost $400 for these drugs. I have a letter from the gentleman who writes, ``Isn't it an outrage for us to pay this price for medication my wife will have to take on a regular basis.'' Well, my answer to that gentleman is yes, it is an outrage, especially in light of the fact that this same drug that costs $400 in Queens, New York would have cost him $107 in Mexico and $184 in Canada. Similar results were borne out by a number of other studies conducted throughout the United States, studies which mirrored the results that the gentlewoman from New York and I saw in our respective districts. But if my constituent or any American went to Mexico or Canada to buy this drug and tried to bring them back over the border into the United States, he or she would be committing a Federal crime and could theoretically be punished for that crime. The only thing criminal I see are these extremely high prices that they are forced to pay for drugs in the United States. Mr. Chairman, $400 for Prilosec, a drug that was researched, patented and manufactured here in the United States. It begs the question, Mr. Chairman: why is Prilosec cheaper in Canada and Mexico than here in the United States where it was made and developed in the first place? It is because in the United States the major drug manufacturers practice price discrimination whereby they charge those least able to pay, such as seniors on a fixed income, more for their medications than they charge others such as HMOs and large hospitals, that enjoy sweetheart deals with the drug manufacturers. Price discrimination is illegal in Canada and in Mexico. That is why I am offering this amendment today, to highlight the practice of price discrimination by the pharmaceutical industry that is being used against millions of American seniors who need prescription drug medication. More simply put, Mr. Chairman, Americans are being gouged by the American pharmaceutical industry. I go about trying to stop this practice of price discrimination by prohibiting funding to enforce Section 801 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Currently, this section of Federal law restricts the rights of an individual to cross across international borders to purchase one's prescription drugs. This amendment will not only allow border residents to travel, but also force this Congress to confront and stop the practice of price discrimination in the pharmaceutical industry. Mr. Chairman, I hear from my constituents all the time about the high cost paid by them for medications. That further reinforces my determination for this Congress to pass legislation mandating the inclusion of a prescription drug benefit under the Medicare program. Unfortunately, the seniors of America did not get that before the recess, despite all of the rhetoric from the other side of the aisle. So I offer this amendment as a first step towards the assistance of America's seniors. Prescription drug medications are not a luxury, they are a necessity. Sometimes we forget that here as we enjoy our generous taxpayer-subsidized, top-of-the-line health insurance. Let me make clear what my amendment will and will not do so as not to confuse the debate. It will decriminalize seniors who must travel south of the border to purchase their prescription drugs. It will highlight the fact that seniors in America are the continued victims of price discrimination which this GOP-controlled Congress continues to ignore. It will continue to prohibit the importation in the United States of non FDA-approved drugs that could be dangerous. This amendment does not weaken inspection standards for the importation of foreign-made drugs into the U.S. At no time does this amendment change the existing Federal regulations regarding the importation of foreign manufactured drugs into the U.S. This amendment will not weaken the ability of our government to inspect and seize illegal narcotics being brought into the United States.","word.count":251,"sep11":-2.20505617977528,"years":1999.65449438202,"days":1657,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.161212997403929,"Topic 2":0.328428354587303,"Topic 3":0.00632796912372287,"Topic 4":0.324446074144156,"Topic 5":0.0056293138887127,"Topic 6":0.0046682449429982,"Topic 7":0.120132627850304,"Topic 8":0.00531479460248441,"Topic 9":0.040378480108506,"Topic 10":0.00346114334788473},{"id":"10920050000659","body":"Henry Cuellar: Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Virginia and the gentleman from California each will control 20 minutes.

The degree to which the FAST Act, introduced by myself and the gentleman from Washington , has attracted strong bipartisan support reflects the success in addressing these issues by expanding capacity by removing an outdated prohibition again fee-based lanes on the interstate but preserving the trust of the driving public, by doing so only if the fees are charged on new lanes so we have new tar or concrete, charged electronically so there are no toll booths, the fees go away when construction and maintenance costs are provided for, and use of the lanes are optional to drivers and optional for States to use. It has a broad base of support, and I do believe that this could add $50 billion in capacity to our roads over the road bill period. I appreciate the chairman's efforts to reflect FAST concepts in the bill and have been very open with him about my intent to offer this amendment, but my concerns are this in TEA LU: that it limits the ability to increase capacity by limiting its FAST-like sections to only three projects; it allows tolls to be charged on existing lanes; it allows tolls to be charged indefinitely; it allows funds raised under these toll programs to be diverted to other uses. Long term, FAST-style fee lanes can be major solutions to relieving congestion but only if we preserve the trust of the driving public. The types of provisions included in TEA LU could lead to the same distrust and resistance that has resulted in every State referendum on increases in gas tax being defeated. When used with FAST-style protections, it has been accepted by drivers, as witnessed by a recent Minneapolis Star Tribune poll that shows 69 percent in support of FAST-style provisions. I urge my colleagues to join those that are supporting us, because this is increasing capacity, like the Associated General Contractors, the National Ready Mixed Concrete Association, and the American Association of State Highway Officials, those who are users like the American Trucking Association, Owner-Operator Individual Drivers, NFIB, Food Marketing Institute, and taxpayer groups like the National Taxpayers Union, Americans for Tax Reform, and Citizens for Sound Economy to support this amendment.

As this Senate gets to work on the fiscal year 2007 budget, our country's fiscal discipline and accountability must be improved. We have a budget deficit not because the Federal Government has a revenue problem; it is because the Federal Government has a spending problem. The Government doesn't tax too little, it spends too much. We must focus our efforts on spending the people's money much smarter, not taking more of their money because it is convenient or expedient. Now, to control spending, I have revived a pair of ideas that Ronald Reagan advocated when he was President. In Ronald Reagan's farewell address to the American people, he said there were two things he wished he had accomplished as President, and what he wanted future Presidents, both Republican and Democrat, to have. They were the line-item veto and a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. As always, and so often, Ronald Reagan was right. That is why I have made the line-item veto and the balanced budget amendment the first two points of my three-point plan to bring fiscal accountability and responsibility to Washington. Let's start first with the line-item veto. When I was honored by the people of Virginia as Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia, I had the power of the line-item veto. I used it 17 times. I saw how useful a tool that was as Governor to knock out undesirable, nonessential spending, or untoward or undesirable policies. It is a power--the line- item veto--or an authority that actually 46 Governors in the U.S. enjoy. It is a very powerful tool to cut wasteful spending and undesirable programs. In fact, after you use it a few times, you don't have to use it as much, because the legislative branch understands that, gosh, he actually is going to use that power, and when it comes to the final budget or appropriations bills, the undesirable or wasteful programs or spending are not in it. The President of the United States, in my view, should have the same power I had as Governor of Virginia, and that is the line-item veto. Together with Senator Jim Talent of Missouri, last September we introduced a constitutional amendment to provide the President with line-item veto authority. It is high time for that. The reason we need a constitutional amendment is that there were times when we were trying do it statutorily. I would be in favor of statutory methods, rather than an amendment, but the Supreme Court struck down the last effort. I think the President, as well as the Congress, ought to be accountable for some of these spending items that create such controversy and are absurd or wasteful. By the way, we need to vote on this. If this goes to the States, I have no question that the States will quickly ratify such a constitutional amendment because, after all, they give their Governors such power. Secondly, we need a balanced budget amendment. This is something many States have, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and virtually the rest of the States. One of the best ways, in my view, to eliminate the Federal deficit and limit the size and scope of the Government is to wrestle it down with the chains of the Constitution. I would also add that balancing the budget is not just a matter of making sure that expenditures are equal to revenue; it is about making sure the Federal Government fulfills its proper, focused, constitutional role--and not expanding into everything that is not necessarily a Federal prerogative, but best left to the people or the States. We all know that a big, bloated Federal Government stifles innovation, saps initiative, and reduces personal responsibility. The third part of my plan is a proposal I offered last week, which I know won't be all that popular in this Chamber, but I think it will be much appreciated and understood by real people in the real world. I have proposed legislation that provides a powerful incentive for Senators and Congressmen to perform their jobs on time, as people do in the private sector. We have a full-time legislature here and we go into session on January 3. One of our prime responsibilities is to pass appropriations bills before the next fiscal year, which is October 1. But it is, to me, deplorable that full-time legislators cannot get their job done on time by October 1. Then, of course, we end up with continuing resolutions, and several months later, some time after Thanksgiving but before Christmas, all kinds of unknown, unscrutinized spending occurs. It gets passed in the dead of night, thinking nobody will notice what is in all these appropriations bills--and actually a lot of people don't know what is in those appropriations bills. That is why I want to impose on Congress what I call the ``paycheck penalty.'' The paycheck penalty says to Members of Congress, if you fail to pass all your appropriations measures by the start of the fiscal year, October 1, which is your job, what you are paid to do, your paychecks will be withheld until you complete your job. Now, taken together, these three measures will eliminate the need to raise taxes to eliminate the deficit. The tax reductions enacted in the last 5 years have helped our country get out of recession. It has incented more investment, created many new jobs--in fact, 4.5 million new jobs--in the private sector; thereby, from all this economic growth and prosperity and more people working in businesses, large, medium, and small doing better, tax receipts to the Government have increased. To illustrate the point, from 2004 to 2005, tax receipts to the Federal Government grew at a rate of 14.5 percent, or $274 billion. This growth is more than twice the rate of economic growth. So the economic growth is strong, but the tax revenues are twice as much to the Federal Government. To further this point, the President's budget forecasts that tax revenues will grow an additional 6.1 percent, or $132 billion, from 2005 to 2006. From the tax cuts of the Reagan administration to the tax cuts we passed in this new century, the fact is that lower taxes stimulate economic growth, stimulate job creation, and stimulate expansion, which in turn increases revenues to the Federal Government. More important, low taxes make this country more competitive for investment and jobs here, rather than people going to invest in places such as China or elsewhere in the world. When people are able to keep more of what they earn, they spend it, save it, invest it, they may expand their business, and they may get more innovative capital equipment, and the fact is lower taxes make this country more competitive and people more prosperous. The opportunity created by Americans spending the fruits of their own labor, as opposed to the Government, is the path to bringing fiscal sanity to the Federal budget. So to avoid future pressure for counterproductive, harmful tax increases, and to achieve a balanced budget, we must make these dramatic changes in how the Federal Government spends the taxpayers' money: the line-item veto, balanced budget amendment, and the paycheck penalty for Members of Congress who have not done their jobs on time. As we closed 2005, Madam President, the Federal Government was responsible for a gross Federal debt of $8.2 trillion. One must ask, how did we get here? Consider these statistics from the last 5 years: Federal spending has increased 33 percent. In 2005, the per-household spending by our Government has grown to $21,878 per year. That figure is compared to the per-household tax, on average, of $19,062 per year, leaving an annual per-household deficit of about $2,800. The macro result is an annual budget deficit in the hundreds of billions of dollars. We are in a time of war, this war on terror, and enormous national disasters have also befallen our country in Louisiana, Alabama, Texas, and in Florida, in the past year. That is why I am introducing this resolution. Even when those occur, this amendment does require the Federal Government to achieve a balanced budget within 5 years of ratification by the States. Each year, the budget deficit would be reduced by 20 percent, until the Federal budget is balanced. This is a phased-in approach, which is realistic and provides needed time for Congress to amend the budget and appropriations processes to provide for a balanced budget. I fully understand that national and global events can significantly affect our country's budgetary needs. Thus, I have include","word.count":2222,"sep11":4.54494382022472,"years":2006.40449438202,"days":4060,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.910456586738597,"Topic 2":0.0266175485504417,"Topic 3":0.00630625409874985,"Topic 4":0.0150880141993019,"Topic 5":0.00630001747853464,"Topic 6":0.00700848196550063,"Topic 7":0.00479915390068794,"Topic 8":0.0144605361119855,"Topic 9":0.00611850998713511,"Topic 10":0.00284489696906562},{"id":"10920060039925","body":"Herb Kohl: Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Chafee amendment, of which I am a cosponsor.

That is why he makes such a great legislator in the Senate. I am with my colleagues. I am sick and tired of delays. It is time for us to move ahead. I have a chart: There have been six attempts by the Democrats to change the subject from $4-a-gallon gas, all while people are suffering at the gas pump and we are having dramatic adverse effects on our economy. We are getting ready for the school year, and school districts are struggling with how they are going to get fuel for the school buses. We have farmers and ranchers starting to put up their crops, and they are wondering how they are going to get money to pay for fuel, which is a major cost. It just doesn't balance out for us. So I am very concerned that we have had these six attempts to move off of $4-a-gallon gas when it is such a vital issue. I can't think of another issue since I have been here that has had this profound an impact on people's lives. We shouldn't be delaying or stopping this matter. There have been other subtle attempts on the other side, even if we move forward, to delay the development of energy, and let me cite a couple of examples. One is the offshore drilling provisions, which we have in our Gas Price Reduction Act on the Republican side, where we look at the offshore drilling--the deep ocean drilling. We have had Members stand here on the Senate floor and say: Well, I am all in favor of that, but we haven't gone ahead and done the seismographic studies to figure out where our deposits are. Well, we have been trying for years, mostly through Senator Domenici's efforts, to try to get the money to do the seismographic studies so we know how much and where those deposits are. But there is delay before we actually get to it. So Members will stand up and say: Well, I am all for offshore drilling, but we need to do the studies. Well, they won't support the studies and the money to get it done. Let's take oil shale, for example. What we need to do is to put the regulations in place so that when the technology is developed and we are ready to move forward with development, we can do that in a phased process. But, no, we are not going to let the regulations go forward, which ends up being an additional delay when the technology is ready to go. So I am hoping--and I want to thank the Senator from New Hampshire, who had proposed the amendment I had made in the Appropriations Committee a little earlier this afternoon--it was objected to on the floor--where we said, let's move ahead with rules and regulations. Then in the amendment it says that we will delay development until 2011 because the technology for development won't be in place any sooner than that. So that was acceptable. The Department of the Interior has got the rules and regulations. They are out there for public comment, but that is all the further they can go. If we continue what we have been doing year after year, we have stopped the development of oil shale dead in its tracks. Even worse than that, when it is ready for development, we will have delayed it that much more because we haven't done the things up front that will allow the oil companies to begin to look at what their lease agreements might be, as the Senator mentioned from his visit, or what the royalty payments might be or what the remediation issues may be when they move in with oil shale. I happen to think the technology we are developing in Colorado is environmentally friendly, and it is not a mining operation. You freeze out an area of the ground, you heat out the middle of it, and you get a high-quality fuel out of there which will help us meet our energy needs. The hydrocarbons we get out of the ground, I think all of us realize these are nonrenewable resources. At some point in time, we are going to have to do something else other than just rely on those. But right now they are the bridge. They are our bridge to renewable energies. I have heard comments on the Senate floor against the Republicans; that all we are interested in is drill, drill, drill. Republicans, to a person, believe that we need to use our hydrocarbons to bridge, and they understand we need the new technology. We are not saying exclude anything. On the other side they are saying: We will just go with renewables. We will let $4 a gallon stand. Who cares. Let it go to $5. Let it keep going to $7.50, even to $10 a gallon. We don't care because the high cost of gasoline will encourage conservation. I think there are other ways we can encourage conservation, and I think a lot of it is happening today. But that is certainly not the way to do it because it has such a dramatic adverse impact on our economy, and it has an adverse impact on the security of this country. Both my colleague from Kansas and New Mexico talked about how all of our dollars are going overseas, more than $700 billion a year going overseas to support the economies of our adversaries. They are the ones who don't support what we are trying to do: to spread democracy around the world. They would like to see us go away. So I think we need to take a serious look at our alternative energies, and we need to act now to do something to increase hydrocarbons and do something to reduce the price of gas at the gas pump. There is one area of the economy that I don't think we have talked much about, and that is the trucking industry. Talk about renewables. What is going to provide the energy for trucks? What renewables do we have for trucks? I know some trucking companies are looking forward to going to propane to help a little bit, but there is not much substitute out there on renewables for the diesel engine right now. The diesel engine is what we use in trains, in trucking, in farming, and it is not going to be an easy solution for us to come up with an alternative fuel for diesel. We need to do what we can to hold down the cost of those kinds of fuels because that new technology is going to take a while to develop. We can't just shut it off today and expect our economy to function when it is such a vital part of what is happening in this country.","word.count":1178,"sep11":7.06460674157303,"years":2008.92415730337,"days":4957,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0992117082440419,"Topic 2":0.225920408230602,"Topic 3":0.0231147016424083,"Topic 4":0.0143137078766152,"Topic 5":0.242595120619815,"Topic 6":0.316952452011029,"Topic 7":0.0200335463458215,"Topic 8":0.028404392355577,"Topic 9":0.022378771691717,"Topic 10":0.00707519098237279},{"id":"10419960015372","body":"W.J.

Both projects are high priority acquisitions, and both projects that we propose to fund involve willing sellers. They are also included in the President's budget. We were not able to do them before tonight because of fiscal limitations, but in view of the fact that we would prefer not to spend the $3 million in the Upper Missouri, we propose to make that move. I would urge the Members to support this.","word.count":361,"sep11":-2.29494382022472,"years":1999.56460674157,"days":1625,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0397727677977316,"Topic 2":0.00687337982554233,"Topic 3":0.0043780272177824,"Topic 4":0.00325673368282692,"Topic 5":0.0266238895827993,"Topic 6":0.011803276058595,"Topic 7":0.687551904946284,"Topic 8":0.212870054247433,"Topic 9":0.00418955244503708,"Topic 10":0.00268041419596826},{"id":"10519970078211","body":"Christopher Dodd: Is there a sufficient second?

Vento: Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this bill. This is an important matter in terms of adequately funding the resources and staff we need to competently do our work. Quite frankly, it is evident from some of the products coming out of the Oversight Committee in terms of policies dealing with the web site that they are not doing their job in a competent and bipartisan manner. It is an egregious action that was taken on a partisan matter which prohibited or prevented direct access by the minority committees to in fact have access through the Internet by our constituencies. In fact, as late as May 28, several committees, the Committee on Agriculture, the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, and the Committee on Ways and Means, did not even have a web site. By virtue of that, the minority was precluded from access to the Internet, while the Republican majority caught up. In fact, the majority had gone through the initiative in terms of providing a web site on the Internet from the Democratic Committee on Banking and Financial Services, and were in fact subsumed by the Republican majority committee by virtue of the Oversight Committee rule. Now in order to get access to that Democratic minority web site you have to go through the Republican material, wonderful photograph of our chairman, and you have to go through a lot of other window dressing in terms of explanation as to what is going on. As the gentleman from Colorado pointed out, you may not even put an electronic bookmark in place, so once you have done that, you could gain access again. That would obviously be helpful--but certainly the issue goes beyond that point. Mr. Chairman, we should not be censoring, the House should not be censoring the speeches of Members on this floor, nor should they be censoring the information on the Internet that is providing direct access and communication on a democratic basis. We should not be afraid of the competition of ideas in this Congress and expressing those and sharing that information on the Internet. Yet, that is what this action has achieved--our constituents can only achieve access to minority views and news in the context that the Republican majority deems appropriate. What are the GOP Members afraid of in terms of communication in this sense? We talk about the Internet in terms of various other improper materials, and the courts have held those limits improper. It is not a matter of space, it is not a matter of security, it is a matter of GOP censorship of the minority Democratic views on these web sites. This substantive amendment is not being permitted to be offered on the floor today, and this Congress has repeatedly provided for authorization legislation on appropriations bills and riders that go far beyond this point, and there is no other opportunity to vote on this subject to be addressed by a vote of the full House. Today we have to take a vote on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California [Mr. Fazio] which tries to transfer some money. I hope Members will rise to vote for that and send a signal, at least, to the Oversight Committee in terms of the abuse that is going on, that this decision and limit is inappropriate and uncalled for. The fact is that we have to go through what really amounts to censorship and editorializing by the GOP majority of the Democratic minority views. I think that this is wrong, it is patently wrong to have moved in this particular direction. This bill would be the proper vehicle, this legislative appropriation measure, to in fact deal with that issue, but it has been rejected by the Committee on Rules, again on a partisan basis. I appeal to my colleagues to vote for and support the Fazio amendment, and at least symbolically to deal with this issue of GOP once more trying to control the voices of dissent in this House in such an inappropriate manner.","word.count":679,"sep11":-5.3061797752809,"years":1996.55337078652,"days":553,"party":"Other","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.127987275422987,"Topic 2":0.254753103187017,"Topic 3":0.00747646797863754,"Topic 4":0.00805710219690574,"Topic 5":0.00603172882086368,"Topic 6":0.0121928732033892,"Topic 7":0.0179618171131683,"Topic 8":0.0183751021291787,"Topic 9":0.366128902881769,"Topic 10":0.181035627066084},{"id":"10820040003826","body":"Doug Bereuter: Mr. Speaker, this Member rises today to join the distinguished gentleman from Nebraska in his Special Order to highlight the health care challenges that rural veterans face when attempting to access care through the Department of Veterans Affairs. For many years, this Member has been far from satisfied with various actions of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, such as, one, the use of the health care allocation formula instituted by the Clinton administration and continuing to this day, which in effect penalizes veterans in sparsely settled States like Nebraska; number two, the reorganization of the Nebraska-Iowa region into a larger region headquartered in the Twin Cities of Minnesota; three, the end of inpatient hospitalization in the Lincoln and Grand Island, VA hospitals; and, four, the current procedural difficulties for veterans to have prescriptions filled. In total, these faulty decisions have amounted to discrimination against veterans in rural areas. First, due to the closure and consolidation of veterans health care facilities in Nebraska, veterans in rural areas frequently travel several hours simply to receive the basic services for which they are entitled and are eligible. As a result of this travel, they must incur transportation costs such as overnight accommodations which other veterans are not expected to incur for the same services. Furthermore, requiring elderly and frequently sick or incapacitated veterans to travel on Interstate 80 or other very busy roads and highways is not only unfair to them, but also places them and other citizens at risk. The severity of this problem was brought to this Member's attention by a January 2002 Lincoln Journal Star article featuring one Nebraska veteran who served in the Navy during World War II. Three years after he was diagnosed with several diseases, his wife of 49 years could no longer care for her husband. She said that putting her husband in a nursing home was the hardest thing she had ever had to do in her entire life. Medicare and a private insurance supplement cover doctors' expenses, and the couple uses their retirement savings to pay for the $4,000 monthly nursing home cost. However, additional expenses include $1,000 a month to cover the cost of seven prescription drugs that this veteran must take to stay alive. Although he qualifies for a prescription drug benefit through the VA, in order to obtain this benefit, the drugs must be prescribed by a VA doctor at VA-approved facilities. As a result, this veteran must travel 50 miles every 6 months in order to have prescriptions reauthorized. Now, because that veteran is 74 years old, confined to a wheelchair, suffers serious blood clots which prohibit him from traveling, this 50- mile trip often proves to be impossible. With the struggles of this veteran and many others in mind, this Member expresses his strongest support for H.R. 2379, the Rural Veterans Access to Health Care Act for 2003. Indeed, this Member is a proud cosponsor of this measure, which was introduced by my colleague, the distinguished gentleman from Nebraska . He is to be commended for crafting this legislation, which addresses a critical problem about which our constituents in Nebraska are increasingly expressing their concerns. Through H.R. 2379, no less than 5 percent of the total appropriated funds for health care would be dedicated to address veterans health care access problems in highly rural or geographically remote areas. As amended by this bill, highly rural or geographically remote would apply to areas in which the veterans have to drive at least 60 minutes or more to a VA health care facility. Each Veterans Integrated Service Network, that is called VISN, director would receive an equal level of funding from this account and then have the discretion to address rural access issues as best fit each VISN. If a VISN would be unable to use all of these funds from this account, the VISN would not be allowed to retain unused funds. Instead, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs would then have the opportunity to reallocate those funds to other VISNs closely nearby or anywhere that is rural and geographically remote. All Members of Congress should agree that the VA must provide adequate services and facilities for veterans all across the country regardless of where they live, in sparsely settled areas with resultant low-usage numbers for VA hospitals. There must be at least a basic level of acceptable national infrastructure of facilities, medical personnel and services for meeting the very real medical needs faced by our veterans wherever they live. There must be a threshold funding level for VA medical services in each State and region before any per capital funding level is applied. Furthermore, I support H.R. 3777, the Healthy Vets Act of 2004. This Member is also a cosponsor of this legislation, introduced by our colleague, the distinguished gentleman from Colorado . This measure would allow those veterans in rural areas which are geographically inaccessible to the nearest VA medical facility to enter into contracts with community health care providers on a fee basis to receive primary health care in their own communities. This authority would allow rural veterans to receive preventive regular medical attention without being forced to travel what is too often a prohibitive distance to seek such care. In spite of the fact that each Congress sets a new record on the amount of appropriation for veterans health care, there have been cutbacks in the access veterans in rural areas have to adequate health care, while there have been advances in other geographic areas. The health care needs of our military veterans must be met to the fullest extent possible. Veterans served in our armed services to protect our freedom and our way of life. As they served our Nation at a time of need, the Federal Government must remember them in their time of need. The debt of gratitude the people the U.S. owe to our veterans surely means we should assist the veterans wherever that need exists. Finally, Mr. Speaker, this Member remains committed, I would say, to ensuring that Nebraska veterans receive the benefits they deserve, benefits they had expected and which the American people said they want to deliver. I urge support of H.R. 2379 and H.R. 3777.","word.count":1037,"sep11":2.55898876404494,"years":2004.41853932584,"days":3353,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0394976635499444,"Topic 2":0.040554511171641,"Topic 3":0.0402901280933392,"Topic 4":0.270697957016711,"Topic 5":0.00657653008961978,"Topic 6":0.0660138596341576,"Topic 7":0.00865057706051315,"Topic 8":0.0889807913820524,"Topic 9":0.39431773737823,"Topic 10":0.044420244623792},{"id":"10419960085551","body":"Larry Pressler: Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to my dear friend and colleague, Senator William Cohen of Maine. Upon his retirement from this body, Senator Cohen will leave behind a legacy of camaraderie, hard work, and dedication to the people of Maine and the United States. His spirit of cooperation will be missed by his friends, constituents and colleagues. Mr. President, it is fitting that Senator Cohen announced his retirement in the chambers of the Bangor City Council--the place where he began his three decades of public service to the people of Maine. In 1969, he proved to be a gifted leader during his tenure as Bangor City Councilor. In 1971, he was elected mayor. In his role as a local public official, Senator Cohen realized quickly the necessity for strong leadership and representation at the national level. In response, he walked over 600 miles across the State of Maine and knocked on thousands of doors in his campaign for the U.S. House of Representatives. In 1972, his grassroots effort paid off and he was elected to Congress. It was in the House that my colleague first made his mark as an advocate of a stalwart national defense, effective intelligence system, and the highest ethical standards for Members of Congress and intelligence agency employees. As a member of the Armed Services Committee, he consistently has sought to keep our national security a top priority. He fought to ensure that America's defense readiness did not fall by the wayside in the face of budgetary constraints. He has been a true guardian of our Nation's security. His efforts have earned the gratitude and respect of all Members of this body and the people of Maine and our Nation. A legislator, author, father, husband, and attorney, Bill Cohen often is referred to as a ``Renaissance Man.'' Over the years, he has shared his literary talents through books such as ``Of Sons and Seasons,'' ``Murder in the Senate,'' and ``A Baker's Nickel.'' His poetry first impressed us 20 years ago during a congressional prayer breakfast when he read several of his poems aloud. He acquired many of his literary fans then and has kept us entertained and inspired ever since. Since then, his literary gift has provided us a fascinating glimpse into his thoughtful and insightful mind. He is a multi-talented leader whose knowledge and genius are certain to guide him through a fulfilling post-Senatorial career. My friend from Maine has said that writing takes solitude--a rare commodity in the busy life he now leads. As he moves on from this hurried lifestyle, I wish him years of solitude, peace, and happiness with his children and wife Janet. Godspeed to my dear friend from Maine.","word.count":451,"sep11":-5.07584269662921,"years":1996.78370786517,"days":635,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.84708981310384,"Topic 2":0.0504362357218588,"Topic 3":0.0107805453417503,"Topic 4":0.0242479956140697,"Topic 5":0.0108094700160393,"Topic 6":0.0115666306247025,"Topic 7":0.00853406295883019,"Topic 8":0.0195970079982748,"Topic 9":0.0121044323002049,"Topic 10":0.00483380632042986},{"id":"10820040004431","body":"Deborah Pryce: Mr. Speaker, I stand before Members to strongly urge my colleagues to support this resolution for freedom and democracy in Iraq. Life under Hussein's ruthless regime was unlike anything we have ever experienced. His cronies, in order to get information out of men, would rape their wives and their sisters and mothers. Women in Iraq frequently lost their husbands to ``the law,'' never knowing what happened to them, where they went or why they were arrested. These same women, forbidden to go to work to support their families, were left to starvation. The Iraqi women under Saddam Hussein's regime were someone's mothers, wives, and sisters, and they suffered tremendously. I led a women's delegation to Iraq and heard these atrocities firsthand from the women who now are free. They no longer dread the strong arm of Saddam Hussein's injustice. Coalition forces are now protecting the newly acquired rights of all Iraqis. I learned of the story of these two women who were protesting. Mr. Speaker, 2 years ago they would have been executed for protesting. They were protesting to get the rights of women included in the Iraqi constitution. One of these women was waving her husband's death certificate saying, we have not waited all these years to be denied freedoms. A reporter, an Islamic reporter, went up to ask, Are you Sunni or Shiite? These women said, We may be one of each, but it is none of your business, we are Iraqis now. That is what this is all about. This is what freedom stands for. This is what it means to two women, one who lost her husband and had no way of knowing what happened to him. This is what we are celebrating today. This is what has been accomplished by our Armed Forces, by the will of this administration. Saddam Hussein, the ruthless murderer, is now in jail. He will be tried by his own people in his own country, and he will get his just rewards, and these two women, despite the fear and dread and horror of their past, will live in freedom.

Fifty years ago, Colonel Aaron Bank's service in the Office of Strategic Services and his experience leading resistance fighters against Nazi Germany convinced him of the need for permanent elite units in the Armed Forces. He envisioned a force that would specialize in small unit and counterinsurgency tactics, intelligence operations, and the training of indigenous soldiers. As a result of Colonel Bank's efforts, in 1922 the Army created the first permanent special operations force, the 10th Special Forces Group at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Colonel Bank became the commander of these soldiers, who are known for their distinctive green berets. Becoming a highly specialized and effective component of our military, the U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force have all followed suit in creating special operations units. The Special Forces have helped revolutionize the way we wage war, and they are an integral part in prosecuting the war on terrorism. When I was in Afghanistan a few month ago, I was not only very impressed by the capabilities and effectiveness of Special Forces, but also very touched by their professionalism and positive impact on the Afghan society. These are the key to the security and the future of Afghanistan, and they are doing a fantastic job. Today we honor the sacrifices made by the special operations soldiers of the Armed Forces who have trained hard, served valiantly in battle, and made the ultimate sacrifice for their country, many times in missions so secret that their valor may never be fully acknowledged. It is right that we also express our deep gratitude for the continuing sacrifices of Army Special Forces soldiers, many of whom are based in my district at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and of all other special operation soldiers in the Armed Forces now fighting throughout the world in defense of the freedoms challenged by the heinous events of September 11, 2001.

We may be doing it again soon. But it's time to bail out Main Street by doing what we should have done 50 years ago, and that is provide Americans with universal health care. It's the fastest and most effective way Congress can shore up the American family. Because we all know that Americans are either paying too much for health care, can't afford to buy enough coverage, or can't afford any coverage at all. And the cost in dollars and in human terms is staggering. A generation ago, the head of General Motors famously said, ``as GM goes, so goes the Nation.'' It's no secret that GM and America are struggling with an economic crisis. We can make the difference by addressing the single largest expense facing an American family and American business today, health care. Every day in America, the American people are forced to dig deeper and deeper into their own pockets to pay for health care. And every day American business is forced to transfer more of the burden to employees or drop coverage altogether. America's health care system today looks like an ambulance riding on one wheel. And even that wheel will soon fall off if we continue to support a failed system that is not made in America, not worthy of America and nothing more than an accident of history. In the early 20th century, there was a movement to provide universal health care. But ironically it was fiercely opposed by the insurance industry at a time when it made most of its money selling death benefits to those who feared a pauper's grave. Emerging from the Great Depression in 1930, Franklin Delano Roosevelt wanted to institute universal health care. But his advisers feared the American Medical Association would kill FDR's proposal for Social Security in their opposition to health care. In the 1950s, the legendary labor leader, Walter Reuther, first won a health care benefit and a pension too for automobile workers in a labor agreement with General Motors. Then Reuther tried to enlist GM and others to join forces and lobby the Federal Government to institute universal health care. But business couldn't see coming the economic storm from global competition and didn't trust government. Organized labor, flush from a victory in Detroit, saw health care as a perpetual win at the bargaining table, and organized medicine was relentless at lobbying until they drove the universal health care program into the ditch again. In the second half of the 20th century, there were other attempts by the American leaders, but all of them were killed by seemingly unlimited lobbying resources. Today we have 50 million Americans with no health care coverage at all, another 25 million Americans without adequate protection, and every American can't find pants with pockets deep enough to keep paying costs that are already out of sight. The only universal truth about health care in America today is that every single American knows someone with a health care crisis or is facing one themselves. American business has to compete today in a global economy, but American business has a major health care benefit expense on its books that the international competitors do not have. Even great companies in my congressional district, which are national models to providing employee benefits like health care, are being stretched to the limit, and their balance sheets, like a rubber band, can only flex so much before they break. We cannot stand idly by and watch when we know that developing and instituting an American single payer health care system can dramatically improve the health of American business and American families literally and financially. And for the first time in decades, we have a chance if we're willing to seize the opportunity. There are cracks in the dams of opposition. A new survey of U.S. doctors published recently in the Annals of Health Research finds that 59 percent of American doctors now support single payer health care plans, which is a dramatic double-digit increase in support in the last 7 years. The U.S. Conference of Mayors passed a resolution a few weeks ago. Organized labor recognizes a changing global economy that means they can best represent workers not at one bargaining table, but on a national level where everyone benefits equally. Even business is beginning to rethink its trust of government. In 2002, Detroit's auto subsidiaries in Canada strongly supported continuation of a single payer health care program because of its positive economic impact on them and their workers. A few years ago, I asked businesses' executives if they would be willing to pay 6 percent of their revenue to off-load health care and no one raised their hand. Now the average cost is 13 percent for business, and a business leader recently asked me if that deal was still on the table. I'm here to say single payer is on the table. It's time to breach the dam of opposition and create a single payer health care system for the health and well-being of the American people and American business. We have tried the alternatives. The free enterprise system has had 50 years. But they can't do it. They have failed again and again, and the costs go up all the time. It's time to do what works in every industrialized country in the world.","word.count":902,"sep11":7.01966292134831,"years":2008.87921348315,"days":4941,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.41080681914058,"Topic 2":0.298260684621902,"Topic 3":0.0858960439734123,"Topic 4":0.010733173217497,"Topic 5":0.122493029517511,"Topic 6":0.0158702811819812,"Topic 7":0.00480010646497627,"Topic 8":0.0370038602552244,"Topic 9":0.00744160934868694,"Topic 10":0.00669439227822791},{"id":"10620000038464","body":"Phil Crane: Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume Madam Speaker, this resolution is necessary to return to the Senate the bill S. 1109 because it contravenes the constitutional requirement that revenue measures shall originate in the House of Representatives. S. 1109 would create a new basis for applying import restrictions and, therefore, violates this constitutional requirement. S. 1109 prohibits the sale, import and export of bear viscera or any product, item, substance containing, or labeled or advertised as containing, bear viscera. The legislation passed by the other body would have the effect of creating a new basis and mechanism for applying import restrictions. The provision would have a direct effect on tariff revenues. The proposed change in our import laws is a revenue-affecting infringement on the prerogatives of the House, which constitutes a revenue measure in the constitutional sense. Therefore, I am asking that the House insist on its constitutional prerogatives. There are numerous precedents for the action I am requesting. For example, on February 25, 1992, the House returned to the Senate S. 884, requiring the President to impose sanctions, including import restrictions, against countries that failed to eliminate large-scale driftnet fishing. On April 16, 1996, the House returned to the Senate S. 1463, amending the definition of industry under the Safeguard Law with respect to investigations involving the import of perishable agricultural products. Again on October 15, 1998, the House returned to the Senate S. 361, prohibiting the import of products containing, or labeled as containing, any substance derived from rhinoceros or tiger. I want to emphasize that this action does not constitute a rejection of the Senate bill on its merits. S. 1109, however, was passed by the other body as a free-standing bill in contravention to the constitutional requirement that revenue measures originate in the House of Representatives. Accordingly, the proposed action today is purely procedural in nature and is necessary to preserve the prerogatives of the House to originate revenue matters. It makes clear to the Senate that the appropriate procedure for dealing with revenue measures is for the House to act first on a revenue bill and for the Senate to accept it or amend it as it sees fit.

I am pleased that Senators Hutchison and Domenici are joining me in introducing this bipartisan legislation. By virtue of their proximity to an international border, law enforcement agencies operating along the border face a variety of unique challenges. Criminal enterprises are able take advantage of weaknesses in security to traffic drugs and other illicit contraband into the country, as well as smuggle weapons and stolen vehicles out of the country. This creates a nexus of criminal activity that requires substantial resources to address. While Congress has dramatically increased funding to hire additional Border Patrol agents and to build tactical infrastructure--such as surveillance cameras and barriers--we haven't done enough in terms of helping local law enforcement. The reality is that although we are making some progress in securing the borders, local law enforcement agencies still have to pick up much of the burden in tackling the criminal activity throughout the region. Many of these police departments are ill-suited to cover these costs without financial assistance. Many are responsible for large, rural areas of land and lack the personnel and equipment to adequately patrol these areas. If we are going to be successful in bringing real security to the border region, we need to have Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies doing their respective parts to fight criminal activity. But to do this, we also need to ensure that local law enforcement have the resources necessary to play a constructive role, and to recognize the substantial costs they are incurring. The Border Law Enforcement Relief Act of 2008 would do just that. Specifically, the legislation would: establish a new competitive grant program within the Department of Justice to assist local law enforcement operating within 100 miles of the U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada; authorize the Attorney General to designate areas outside of the 100-mile limit as ``High Impact Areas'' to permit additional police departments impacted by border-related criminal activity, such as drug smuggling, to access grant funding; and authorize $100 million each year for the next 5 years to implement this program. Let me also be clear about what this legislation would not do. It does not confer local law enforcement with authority to enforce Federal immigration law. The purpose of this bill is to help these agencies cover some of the costs they incur in addressing border-related criminal activity, not to shift another burden to them. The U.S.-Mexico border region is a vibrant area, economically and culturally. International trade with our southern neighbor continues to increase and communities on both sides of the border maintain strong ties. Unfortunately, over the last year and a half we have seen a dramatic increase in the level of violence in Mexico as the government steps up efforts to tackle drug cartels--over 4,000 people have been killed. This violence has had a negative impact on both sides of the border, and Congress recently provided $400 million in assistance for Mexican law enforcement to address this problem. But we also need to be aware of the fact that local law enforcement within the United States also need additional resources to prevent this violence from spreading and to fight these drug gangs in a comprehensive manner. I strongly believe this legislation will provide this essential assistance and I hope my colleagues will support this effort. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:","word.count":617,"sep11":7.03651685393258,"years":2008.89606741573,"days":4947,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.372819959149624,"Topic 2":0.120513491678298,"Topic 3":0.0444002818409196,"Topic 4":0.26794782757944,"Topic 5":0.0811973018337633,"Topic 6":0.012974271762724,"Topic 7":0.0147177498672302,"Topic 8":0.0404725408960805,"Topic 9":0.0273952906325266,"Topic 10":0.0175612847593937},{"id":"10619990037272","body":"Thomas Sawyer: Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding me this time. Mr. Speaker, in addition to the gentleman from Florida , I would like to enter into the record the other original cosponsors of this bill, those being, the gentleman from North Carolina ; the gentleman from New York ; the gentleman from Florida ; the gentlewoman from Texas ; the gentleman from Arkansas ; the gentleman from Georgia ; the gentleman from Iowa ; the gentleman from Florida ; the gentleman from Ohio ; the gentleman from Tennessee ; and the gentleman from Virginia . The reason I do that is I want to evidence the broad geographic interest in providing some means of relief for folks who are suffering from the malaise of drugs. I wish to thank also the dozens of cosponsors of this legislation from both sides of the aisle. It is my expectation that the bill soon will be introduced and receive bipartisan support in the United States Senate as well. This legislation will provide much needed resources to State and local governments for new prosecutor-managed drug treatment options for eligible nonviolent offenders. The program is designed for offenders who need and seek an opportunity to break the terrible chains of drug addiction and take back control of their lives. In fact, such a program has been administered successfully for more than a decade in Brooklyn, New York. It has been rigorously evaluated and found to have resulted in higher treatment success, low recidivism rates and substantial tax dollar savings. This legislation will be an important new addition to our Nation's drug demand reduction efforts. Mr. Speaker, most State and local criminal prosecutions are resolved through guilty pleas and plea bargains. Plea agreements prevent our criminal justice system from coming to a screeching halt and, as such, they are a valuable tool. This particular legislation represents another option for offenders who plead guilty to nonviolent offenses such as personal drug use. Just to be clear, violent drug offenders and serious drug traffickers will not be eligible under this legislation. The legislation also authorizes new Federal funding for programs designed and managed by State and local prosecutors who prosecute nonviolent offenders who are in desperate need of treatment. It allows prosecutors to select only eligible nonviolent offenders for a rigorous program of mandatory drug treatment and strict rules and conditions. Prosecutors have total discretion to select participants. Participants must be identified as being in need of treatment but they must also not have been convicted of a felony crime of violence or a major drug offense as defined under Federal law. An important benefit of this option is that a prosecutor retains the leverage of a substantial prison sentence to be used if an offender violates program or treatment requirements. That is called accountability. This accountability provides prosecutors with a common sense cost- effective alternative for offenders who really want to reform their lives. A successful model program of this type is the drug treatment alternative to prison program, as I mentioned, established in 1990 by the Office of the District Attorney for Kings County, which is Brooklyn, New York. Evaluation results of the New York program indicate high treatment retention rates, low recidivism and significant cost savings. The 1- year retention rate in drug treatment is 66 percent. The recidivism rate for participants is less than a half for comparable offenders, 23 percent compared to 47 percent. Nearly all employable program graduates, that is 92 percent, are now working or are in vocational programs compared with only 26 percent who were employed prior to entering the program. This particular program in Brooklyn, New York, reportedly has saved the city and the State more than $15 million over the past 10 years. The program holds great promise for communities across America. It is designed to combat drugs and address the treatment needs of eligible nonviolent offenders who desire to forsake crime and drugs and regain control of their lives. Experience has shown that this approach breaks addiction, protects lives, assists families, promotes gainful employment and saves substantial tax dollars. The legislation itself will provide funds up to 75 percent of program costs directly to State and local governments. The total authorized under this bill is almost a half a billion dollars. The program grants will be administered by the United States Department of Justice. State and local government recipients must match by at least 25 percent the Federal grant award amount. Evaluations will be required and funded. Each program is required to maintain an enforcement unit of sworn officers to monitor and apprehend any offenders who violate program requirements and attempt to abscond from their responsibilities. There are requirements for ensuring a fair geographic distribution of funds, so that people in Maine or people in California or people in Washington or Iowa get a fair shot at getting the funding for their treatment. Grant awards are to be made, to the extent practicable, to each State and to rural suburban and urban jurisdictions. Madam Speaker, I do not have to remind you or other Members of the need for us to do everything possible to help State and local governments respond to their continuing drug challenges. Even the White House's Office of National Drug Control Policy indicates that overall drug use has increased from 6.4 percent of our population in 1997 to 7 percent in 1999. That is a 10 percent increase in 2 years. While marijuana and crack use has decreased among youth, Ecstasy, methamphetamine and ``designer drug'' use has shot through the roof among youth and adults. We are seeing overdoses and deaths as we have never seen them before. Drug-induced deaths number about 17,000 annually and are rising. In total, drug-related deaths, that is, where someone dies as a result of drug use, now exceed 50,000 each year. That is more than the number of murders in this country on an annual basis. We need to take this important step as outlined in this legislation in a national effort to turn this situation around, to make our communities safer and to improve the quality of life for everybody in America. This initiative will make a substantial contribution to this effort. Madam Speaker, I want to highlight in particular how this program, on a point-by-point comparison, will help in California because, as always, I go home every weekend, and that is kind of where my heart is. California has an initiative on the ballot this year called Prop 36, and it is being marketed to the voters as a drug treatment initiative to try and give people assistance. In fact, the initiative itself is around 4,500 words; and interestingly enough, of those 4,500 words, about 3,600 talk about sentencing and incarceration and doing time in prison. You would think that an initiative that is supposed to address drug treatment would talk about drug treatment instead of about sentencing and the like. In fact, this initiative spends about 390 words out of 4,500 talking about treatment, and then it only talks about funding. Prop 36 in California is a sham, and I would hope that the other Members of this body would take the time to read it and share it with their people, because, if it is successful in California, it is coming to your State soon. It is kind of like a bad movie. We need to defeat Prop 36. The legislation that is on the floor today addresses actual treatment opportunities for people, compared to Prop 36, which offers no treatment whatsoever. In fact, the single most effective means of helping people suffering from drug addiction, which is blood testing and urinalysis, under Prop 36 is forbidden. Think about that. Prop 36 says it is a drug treatment, but it removes the single most effective tool that professionals in the field use to hold folks accountable for getting rid of this scourge. I want to close, if I can, Madam Speaker. This legislation put forward by the gentleman from Florida is about fighting drugs harder and smarter. It can make a real difference in promoting demand reduction and breaking the link between drugs and crime for many eligible nonviolent offenders who are at great risk of pursuing criminal careers. Both sides of the aisle support this legislation. So do criminal justice professionals. Treatment experts and providers, such as Phoenix House and the Therapeutic Communities of America, have endorsed this legislation. So have Pennsylvania and New York District Attorney Associations. We have worked very closely with the DA from Brooklyn, New York, to develop this legislation based upon his proven experience. The chairman of the committee, the gentleman from Florida , has personally visited the program and discussed it with the offenders going through it. Respected researchers and evaluators have documented the program's successes. If properly designed and administered as outlined in this legislation, I am convinced that we have the opportunity to save lives and save money in this country. Madam Speaker, H.R. 4493 is a good bill, and it is much needed. It is important to States, communities, and families across this country. In combatting drug use, we must identify programs that work and support them. We cannot afford any longer to squander tax dollars on unnecessary bureaucracies and ineffective approaches. Accordingly, I urge all Members to vote for H.R. 4493. I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this very important issue this afternoon.","word.count":320,"sep11":-1.96067415730337,"years":1999.89887640449,"days":1744,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.240925411359836,"Topic 2":0.180630847347968,"Topic 3":0.00986292287023219,"Topic 4":0.00796053085854131,"Topic 5":0.321727493860832,"Topic 6":0.00611636571613769,"Topic 7":0.0067888826407078,"Topic 8":0.202155073111676,"Topic 9":0.0154041455020404,"Topic 10":0.00842832673202844},{"id":"10419950049555","body":"Larry Combest: Mr. President, again, let me call to the Senate's attention--as I have done now in the Republican caucus at lunch, and others in the Democratic Caucus, I think, had similar material--that we have put together, with the clearance of Senator Byrd on the Democratic side of the aisle, a managers package to accommodate those Members who were not present when a unanimous-consent agreement was entered into at 7:45 last Thursday night.

I do note a marked shift in the strategy of our opponents. They are not talking so much about how the first amendment to the United States Constitution Bill of Rights would be violated by our version of the bill, the soft money prohibition. There have been a few comments, but this has not been the main thrust. There is a good reason for it. That is because there is not a credible case that can be made that banning soft money contributions to the political parties is unconstitutional. I think it is useful at this time to lay out a few of the reasons why this is the case, so no one can be confused by the desperate attempt that has been made to label any attempt at campaign finance reform, regardless of what its provisions might be, as unconstitutional. It has become a mantra, a standard line, but it does not hold water regarding the bill before us. The first proposition is very straightforward and that is that Congress can prohibit corporate and labor contributions. Congress prohibited the contributions by corporations in 1907 in the Tillman Act, and then in 1947 it prohibited the same kinds of contributions by unions under the Taft-Hartley Act. The courts have recognized that corporate treasury money can amount to an undue influence or an unfair advantage. That is why in a couple of key cases the courts have so ruled. In Massachusetts, Citizen For Life v. FEC, 1984, for example, they stated: Then, after making that very clear with regard to the ability of restricting direct corporate contributions, the Austin case made it clear and affirmed this decision, saying: It is clear law, indisputable law, that Congress can prohibit corporate and labor direct contributions to candidates or to the political parties. Furthermore, so there is no confusion because there was a lot of talk today about somehow we have to demonstrate actual corruption in each instance before we can do something about it, that is not the law with regard to our ability to limit individual contributions. The Court has been clear that we can limit individual contributions either in the case of actual corruption, the reality of corruption, or the appearance of corruption. This is the system that was validated in the most significant ruling of many decades in the area of campaign finance reform, Buckley v. Valeo, 1974. Let me put some of the language in the Record from that decision that supports that. The court said: Later in the decision the court continued: The Court then said: That had to do with the quid pro quos. And then the Court continued: The Buckley case makes it clear you can limit the individual contributions. The Court said: So these are the court cases. If you do not believe my word on it alone, I suggest one take a look at the letter we have from 126 legal scholars, constitutional scholars around the country who say specifically that it is entirely constitutional to ban soft money given to the parties. These scholars wrote as a group in a letter: And so on. Mr. President, 126 constitutional scholars have backed up this almost obvious notion we can ban the soft money given to the political parties. I might add, since the Senator from Kentucky is fond of quoting the ACLU as one of his allies on this issue, in fact, every living former president, executive director, and legal director of the ACLU all think that it is perfectly constitutional to ban soft money. Finally, if you do not believe any of those folks, I hope you would believe the Senator from Washington, one of the strongest opponents of our bill. Senator Gorton, on this floor, in a candid moment, said: So even one of our most learned and effective opponents on this issue, Senator Gorton, has said on this floor that it is perfectly constitutional to ban soft money. That is why you are not hearing much about the constitutional problems in this bill, as you did last year. I think some of those arguments weren't too strong, but they certainly were stronger. This bill would pass constitutional muster quite easily. I believe there is no legitimate authority to contradict that. I believe it is important to have this in the Record. Perhaps this will be returned to later on, as an argument. I have noticed a strong diminution in the reliance on the constitutional argument. There are other arguments being made: That somehow this is a dagger to the heart of one party or another; the attempt to have Senator McCain answer very specific questions about comments he made in his Presidential campaign. The opposition seems very diffused on this point on a number of issues, but the constitutional question is not being very effectively or seriously raised. Mr. President, I suggest that is because there is no legitimate constitutional argument against what we are trying to do. I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.","word.count":852,"sep11":-1.96067415730337,"years":1999.89887640449,"days":1744,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.108439356162812,"Topic 2":0.131013420490822,"Topic 3":0.00625863008193692,"Topic 4":0.0307895770376997,"Topic 5":0.0144753331099137,"Topic 6":0.0105286097176082,"Topic 7":0.0091046800760413,"Topic 8":0.0118000551741364,"Topic 9":0.668173824771262,"Topic 10":0.0094165133777669},{"id":"10519980001333","body":"Frank Pallone: Mr. Speaker, for over three decades, the National Sea Grant College Program has performed an extraordinary service not only to the State of New Jersey, but also to the nation. Sea Grant is a competitive, merit-based, aquatic science program that benefits marine and freshwater industries, environments, and communities of the United States by applying science and technology to problems of day-to-day concern. Few federal programs have achieved the exceptional economic impact that the Sea Grant College Program has shown since its inception in 1996. Research conducted through the Sea Grant Program is crucial to meeting important objectives in the areas of aquatic resource conservation and management, sustainable development, technology innovation, and coastal and inland water quality. Furthermore, the program has proven to be very effective in transferring its scientific and technical results to industry as well as identifying and communicating local needs and problems to Sea Grant program managers and researchers. Recent examples of Sea Grant supported research and outreach activities that have positively impacted the lives of New Jersey residents include: Sponsoring a commercial fisherman's safety training program. Techniques learned in this course enabled a first mate on a Cape May fishing vessel to save the life of his captain's son during an accident at sea; Supporting a ``red tide'' research effort to examine nitrogen inputs into estuaries. This project has already developed into a full-scale, water quality monitoring and management project with potential for national applications; and Coordinating a partnership of the New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland Sea Grant Programs with the Public Service Gas and Electric Company for a massive marsh restoration effort on the Delaware Bay. This effort is the largest of its kind in the country and represents a unique collaboration of government, industry, academic and scientific interests. To be competitive in the future, it is essential that the U.S. develop a skilled workforce that is scientifically literate and environmentally sensitive. The National Sea Grant College Program has been a leader in science education from ``hands-on'' science experiences at the K-12 level, to supporting thousands of graduate students in aquatic and environmental science. Informal education of the general public and technical advice for businesses are also important aspects of Sea Grant's education objectives. The National Sea Grant College Program is truly a program worthy of our investment.

It pertains to the minimum wage. I will have a unanimous consent request that I will propound in a moment. As we are debating new trade practices, we must not forget important protections for America's workers. Many of these protections are addressed through the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act, but for the last 60 years there has been another important protection for workers, and that is the minimum wage. It has now been over 6 years since Congress voted to increase the minimum wage. In that time, the cost of living has increased 12 percent while the real value of the minimum wage has steadily declined. In fact, by 2003, all of the gain achieved through the last increase will have been wiped out. Today, minimum wage employees working 40 hours a week 52 weeks a year earn only $10,700--more than $4,000 below the poverty line for a family of three. In the last 6 years, the purchasing power of the minimum wage has deteriorated to near record low levels. Teacher's aides and health care workers are among the hard-working Americans who are unable to make ends meet on a $5.15 per hour wage. In fact, the current minimum wage does not provide enough income to allow full-time workers to afford adequate housing in any area of the country. In my State of South Dakota, the minimum wage is hardly enough for a family to make ends meet. According to the National Low-Income Housing Coalition, a minimum wage earner can afford a monthly rent of no more than $268. In South Dakota, a worker earning the minimum wage must work 79 hours a week in order to afford a typical two-bedroom apartment. In fact, estimates show that for a worker to be able to afford a two-bedroom apartment in South Dakota, they would have to earn $10.12--nearly 200 percent of the present minimum wage. That is why we need to pass Senator Kennedy's new minimum wage legislation. It would provide a $1.50 increase over the next 2 years. This is the least we can do, and it is long overdue. By increasing the minimum wage by $1.50, working families will receive an additional $3,000 per year in income. While this increase would not be enough to lift the family of three above the poverty line, it would provide the resources to buy over 15 months of groceries, 8 months of rent, 7 months of utilities, or tuition at a two-year community college. The reality is that American workers are working harder and harder for less and less. It is time for Congress to address the needs of America's working families. It is time to act and raise the minimum wage.","word.count":473,"sep11":0.710674157303371,"years":2002.5702247191,"days":2695,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0618741172229265,"Topic 2":0.181505330593165,"Topic 3":0.00621484966778911,"Topic 4":0.0102700950633094,"Topic 5":0.0131810161771975,"Topic 6":0.00448752598962932,"Topic 7":0.00520199957602814,"Topic 8":0.361840133542442,"Topic 9":0.122957637926801,"Topic 10":0.232467294240711},{"id":"10519970065035","body":"Jay Rockefeller: Without objection, it is so ordered The bill was considered read the third time, and passed, as follows:","word.count":106,"sep11":-4.32584269662921,"years":1997.53370786517,"days":902,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.151017698048896,"Topic 2":0.0576510310855662,"Topic 3":0.084483095354168,"Topic 4":0.353694662314181,"Topic 5":0.00678395973497794,"Topic 6":0.0126299894844946,"Topic 7":0.271384921767314,"Topic 8":0.0388605693163855,"Topic 9":0.0195758768912001,"Topic 10":0.00391819600281647},{"id":"10419960036549","body":"Duncan Hunter: Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to go over the language of the provision itself and what it does because the operational and tactical control that is vested in the President and his subordinates in the American chain of command is a very precious thing not just to people that are in the military forces but to their parents, to their families, to the people who rely on somebody who is accountable for that young person who may be in a life or death combat situation.

First, with respect to David Jones, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs and his problems with this certification, if the President does not have time to give the certification well in advance, which is what we would like to have, because we want the White House to think about this, we want them to think it through, then he can give it after he has made the deployment. Mr. Chairman, nonetheless, we go through some fairly important areas. We ask the President when he does this certification to set forth a description of the national security interest. We do not think that is unfair or unreasonable, that would be advanced by the placement of United States forces under the United Nations operational or tactical control. We ask him to tell us that. We ask him to tell us the expected size and composition of the U.S. forces involved. We think that is reasonable. We ask him to explain the precise command and control relationship between the U.S. forces involved and the U.N. command structure. We think that is reasonable. We ask him to explain to us the extent to which the U.S. forces involved will rely on forces of other countries for security and defense. I think this element is a very important one. The degree to which we rely on forces, those Americans that might be under operational or tactical control of a U.N. commander that agree that we are going to rely on the forces of other countries for security and defense, that our forces will see their security depend on somebody else, we think that is a very important element for the President to lay out. So we ask the President to lay out concisely these very important elements. We do not deprive him of his constitutional authority. We just require him to certify. We think that is reasonable.","word.count":447,"sep11":-5.14606741573034,"years":1996.71348314607,"days":610,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0237913270323216,"Topic 2":0.339401017378639,"Topic 3":0.00683786142114683,"Topic 4":0.023457370987769,"Topic 5":0.00965474698489417,"Topic 6":0.528584010420259,"Topic 7":0.00241303086790996,"Topic 8":0.00773248898563321,"Topic 9":0.00832788054481578,"Topic 10":0.0498002653766109},{"id":"10619990028574","body":"Barbara Lee: Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York for yielding me this time. As the Congresswoman who represents the largest Vietnamese-American population in the United States in Orange County, California, this Jackson-Vanik is about the immigration issue and the reunification of the families, the Vietnamese-American families that we have here in our country. We have gone through the process. Our State Department has allowed that these members of families come to the United States, and then they run into a problem. The problem is that the corrupt government of Vietnam charges bribes of about $2,000 to try to get an exit for each person who is trying to come here to the United States to be with their family members. Well, when one considers that the household income in Vietnam is $300 a year, $2,000 is not an easy amount to get one's hands on to get one's exit visa so that one can come here and be with one's family after our State Department says, in fact, one should and can be here in the United States. So on the issue of immigration, the government of Vietnam has not held up its end. But in addition to that, why should we, the United States, help a government that is so against human rights? The government continues to repress basic political and religious freedoms and does not tolerate most types of public dissent. This is what the United States State Department reported in its 1999 review of the human rights situation in Vietnam. What they are doing now in Vietnam is that, instead of holding prisoners in prisons, they put them in house arrest so that the rest of the nations will not criticize them internationally. In fact, the last time I was in Vietnam, while I was talking to a dissident under house arrest in his home, the government figured out I was there. They sent their police knocking on the door trying to get through. I do not know, if I had not had a couple of Marines there with me, what would have happened. But the situation is that dissidents do not have an ability to speak their mind under this government. So I ask again, why should we reward that government with a Jackson-Vanik waiver? It was just 2 months ago when the Vietnamese police placed Ha Si Phu under house arrest and threatened to charge him with treason. The Vietnamese authorities apparently believe that Mr. Ha is connected to an open appeal for democracy issued by intellectual dissidents. If convicted, he could face the death penalty. Sadly, this is not the first time that Ha Si Phu has been harassed by authorities for peacefully expressing his views. In recent years, he has become well known at home and abroad for his political discourses and for focusing international attention on Vietnam's terrible human rights record. For his efforts, he was imprisoned in December 1995 for a year; and he continues to be under House arrest, like the rest of the people who speak up in Vietnam and say that what they are doing is wrong. How do we reward this country when it punishes its citizens for exercising basic human rights; a country where a citizen is punished for speaking out against what he or she believes is wrong? Unfortunately, Mr. Ha's situation is not the only example of what we see over and over and over in this country. Our ambassador, Mr. Pete Peterson, says that human rights conditions are getting better. They are not. We have only to ask the relatives who live here in the United States. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this resolution.","word.count":386,"sep11":-2.16011235955056,"years":1999.69943820225,"days":1673,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.285426847923114,"Topic 2":0.0151842825295899,"Topic 3":0.00722831585584382,"Topic 4":0.0196423673347821,"Topic 5":0.00275471644545823,"Topic 6":0.422093349349674,"Topic 7":0.00700674962338091,"Topic 8":0.0933158307695508,"Topic 9":0.144499345656902,"Topic 10":0.00284819451170325},{"id":"11020070058548","body":"Lamar Smith: Pursuant to rule XXII, the clerk will report the motion to invoke cloture.

Mr. Speaker, last night in his address to the United States on the administration's policy towards Iraq, the President laid out his indictment of the Iraqi regime and particularly its leader, Saddam Hussein. In doing so, he answered a number of questions that Members of this body, as well as the American public, have raised regarding the administration's policies. While I will argue that I have few differences with the President on those issues with respect to the Iraqi regime's efforts to produce weapons of mass destruction and its efforts against its own people, even the tenuous, but troubling, allegations regarding its connections with al Qaeda, the President still did not answer a lot of questions and a lot of questions that have been raised on this floor. That is why I intend to support the substitute offered by the gentleman from South Carolina . As poignant as the President's speech was with respect to his indictment of Iraq, it lacked crucial substance with respect to the means by which the United States can achieve the containment and dismantling of the regime and its threat to the region and, ultimately, our Nation. The President made limited reference to the need for a strong international coalition to rid the world of this menace. Unlike the last war with Iraq, the present administration has given insufficient attention to building the broad coalition to achieve the end we all desire. I do not believe, nor do I believe most Members believe, that the United States must obtain permission from other nations of the world to ensure our own safety. Clearly, we possess the military might. But, at the same time, our strength to defend ourselves and interests is bolstered by our ability to build coalitions with our friends; and undermining that ability will no doubt have costs. We do not know whether or not acting unilaterally will undermine our efforts with Iraq, with the Middle East, with our interests throughout the world, and our own long-term security. We risk losing the moral high ground that was so helpful in our last war with Iraq and has become the cornerstone of American policy. We run the risk of alienating our friends and foes alike, and I think that is a risk that this body should consider. Unfortunately, this administration has built a record on eschewing alliances in favor of unilateral approaches to foreign policy, contrary to the scope of American foreign policy by Republican and Democratic administrations for the last 60 years; and it is one that I think is of grave consequence as we go further. No question that we can address Iraq militarily, but what will be the cost in the long run? How long will we have to leave ground troops if we do not have a coalition going in with us? I think the administration is on the right track with respect to the regime, but I am concerned about whether or not the United States will have to shoulder the full burden and what will be the security risk of leaving tens of thousands of American troops on the ground in Iraq? No one in the administration, no one in this body or the other body knows how long it will take. And our recent experience in Afghanistan and in the Balkans tells us that it can take a long time before we can rebuild a nation. Mr. Speaker, the Spratt resolution very clearly lays out where the Congress stands with respect to the Iraqi regime and their flagrant disregard for international law, their flagrant disregard for the U.N. Security Council resolutions. But it also says that the administration should try and do what every administration going back since the beginning of the United Nations has done, which is to build a broad- based coalition, just as President George Herbert Walker Bush did in 1991 that worked so masterfully in Desert Storm. Should that fail, it gives the President the authority to come back to the Congress and then ask for an authorization of war. We can do this now without risking the United States, putting the United States at grave risk, but we can also do it to ensure that the United States has a long-term foreign policy that is in our best interests, that ensures that we have our allies throughout the world working to ensure that we protect our interests throughout the world as well as defending the homeland here. Unfortunately, I am afraid that this administration too often seeks to ignore the attempts that all of these prior administrations have attempted to do in ensuring U.S. national security. So, Mr. Speaker, I have yet to see where the resolution, which I agree that the bipartisan leadership crafted in bringing it closer to where we ought to be and having consultation with the Congress and trying to build a coalition, but I am afraid it still gives a blank check. I think the resolution by the gentleman from South Carolina still puts the U.S. firmly on record with respect to the regime but also does it in a way that protects the historical precedents of American foreign policy and the defense of the Nation.","word.count":879,"sep11":1.10112359550562,"years":2002.9606741573,"days":2834,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.246861690833304,"Topic 2":0.106042213957589,"Topic 3":0.0166357449731592,"Topic 4":0.0166792906859537,"Topic 5":0.0121977074581804,"Topic 6":0.241006905015404,"Topic 7":0.0173473173837363,"Topic 8":0.178048317613626,"Topic 9":0.159468411153879,"Topic 10":0.0057124009251683},{"id":"10419950146600","body":"Harry Reid: Mr. President, before my friend, the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia leaves the floor, I join in commending the majority leader for his service.

If there were ever an illustration of why the term limit argument is so worthless, we need only look at the distinguished services rendered by Senator Robert Dole. Those people who are still beating the drums--the unconstitutional drums, I might add--of term limits are people who do not recognize that being a great leader does not come overnight. Even though I do not always agree with the majority leader I have always found him to be fair, deliberate, and really statesmanlike in the things that he does in the Senate. That did not come by accident. He, as has been outlined by the Senator from West Virginia, has served not only in the military but in this body for many years. And the only thing term limits would do is increase the power of bureaucrats, those nameless, faceless people that do not answer phones, who we continually hear complaints about. It would also greatly increase the power of the lobbyists who fill these hallways of the U.S. Senate, and, of course, it would also increase the power of congressional staff and weaken the ability of the American public to be served well.

The arguments of the chairman and ranking member do not relate, in many cases, to the amendment that has been put forward. The Senator from Missouri just made the argument that my amendment differs from the use limit provisions for emergency surveillance because my amendment would limit the use of information about foreign targets. But that is not true. That is not the amendment I offered. My amendment only puts limits on information about U.S. persons. The Government can always use information about foreign persons. With regard to the comments of the Chair of the committee, the supposed burden of identifying which communications involved U.S. persons only comes up if the Government starts its targeting procedures before it gets court approval, and then fails to keep track of what it is collecting during that time. And it only comes up if the Government procedures are targeting Americans in the United States, in which case I think there are overwhelming policy and constitutional reasons why this information needs to be retrieved and its use limited. Moreover, if the intelligence community is concerned about this potential burden, it can do what it says it already does with information gathered using the PAA, and that is to label it. Then it shouldn't have any problem finding it later on; it shouldn't be cumbersome. The arguments of the chairman and ranking member would yield the following result: We set up rules for the Government, the Government doesn't follow the rules, and there is simply no consequence at all. The law has no teeth. There is no incentive for the Government to follow the rules. Again, under my amendment, the Government can use information even about U.S. persons if it indicates a threat of death and serious bodily harm, and the FISA Court can allow the Government to use any information if the Government fixes the defective procedures. On that point, I am very troubled by the arguments of the Senator from Missouri. He says that my amendment will not even allow the Government to fix the problem with its procedures. That is absolutely false. I specifically stated that the Government is given an opportunity to fix the problem. If it fixes the problem, the FISA Court can allow it to use the information. If the Government gets a complete free pass and faces no consequence whatsoever for adopting and implementing unlawful procedures, then the law's requirements for targeting and minimization procedures and the FISA Court's oversight of these procedures have no meaning. The Government would be allowed to intrude on the private conversations of Americans with no consequences. This amendment contains a very modest series of provisions.

We are experiencing some of the worst flash flooding in over 100 years. These storms dumped more than 7 inches of rain in the Moorhead, Minnesota and Fargo, North Dakota area in an eight-hour period, swamping hundreds of basements, and streets, and acres of farm land. This past weekend, I had the opportunity to see first hand the effects of the storm when I visited the communities of Ada, Borup, Perley, Hendrum, and Moorhead. Actually, I had originally planned before the storm on being in the area to celebrate the grand opening of the Ada Hospital following its destruction during the Floods of 1997. Just three short years ago, Ada was hit with the worst flooding in 500 years. They are still recovering from that flood. How do you explain floods like these? They don't just happen once in a while contrary to reports of 100 or even 500-year floods, they've been happening every year in northwestern Minnesota. Last year, Ada experienced severe hail storms and a Labor Day flood. In 1998, there were three floods in February, May and June. In 1997, of course, there was the huge flood in the Red River Valley. Swollen from the heavy rains, the Wild Rice River became a huge pool of water 25 miles wide and 30 miles long that flowed steadily overland through northwestern Minnesota, drowning millions of dollars worth of crops in its path. The pool developed as heavy runoff collected at higher elevations in Becker and Mahnomen counties, then flowed into the Red River Valley toward Ada. You have to realize that this land is very flat, dropping only about one foot per mile, so the water moves slowly, but causes severe crop damage. Several rivers converge and flood prevention measures have failed to funnel excess water into the Red River. I intend to work with representatives from the watershed districts, and the Army Corps of Engineers to see whether past flood control measures have resulted in what has become constant flooding in this area of northwest Minnesota and what can be done to alleviate this problem in the future. I saw fields with three or four feet of water that had been planted with wheat, soybeans, and sugar beets earlier this year. Now, these crops are all destroyed, and the stench of rotting crops has begun. Earlier this week, Governor Ventura declared this area a state of emergency so that federal, state and local emergency management officials can work together to assess the damage and see whether federal assistance will be required. As if this wasn't enough, eight counties in southeastern Minnesota were declared emergency areas and Governor Ventura has asked the federal government for money to help with their recovery following rainstorms of May 17th. I was happy to support the Governor's request and to learn that President Clinton has declared this region a disaster so that they are eligible for federal funding. This region of Minnesota received 5 to 7 inches of rain on May 17th, followed by another heavy storm May 31. Since then, even small rainfalls have resulted in overflows and drainage problems. It's too early to tell the extent of the damage in northwestern Minnesota. Preliminary estimates include damage to 430 houses, primarily in the Moorhead area, and $10 million damage to crops in Becker and Mahnomen counties. But losses will go much higher. The greatest crop damage appears to be in Clay and Norman counties. There, crops have been damaged or destroyed on more than 500 square miles of land, according to county officials. That could mean $50 million in lost crops, and half that again in out-of-pocket planting costs. Flooding remains a serious blow to farmers in Minnesota. There are about 300 commercial farmers left in Norman County in northwestern Minnesota. They've been losing 20 or 30 farms every year recently. It's too late to plant any cash crops in that part of the state. Some farmers will plant a ``cover crop'' to control erosion; others simply will try to control weeds and start planning for next year. As in every disaster that my state has faced, I've been inspired once again by the people of Minnesota, who rally together for their communities when tragedy strikes. It's during critical times such as these that we finally understand the importance of neighbor helping neighbor. At a time when we all too often fail to make the effort to get to know and appreciate our neighbors, Minnesotans in a great many of our communities have formed lasting bonds over this past week and found their civic spirit has been restored. Mr. President, I intend to work with Governor Ventura to examine the need for federal funding to help those Minnesotans devastated by this most recent flooding. I also want to work with the Governor, the Farm Services Administration, and the Department of Agriculture in anticipation of federal funding needs for farmers who have had severe crop losses. I stand together with my colleagues in the Minnesota delegation, and with our colleagues from North Dakota who are facing destruction in their states equal to our own. When disaster strikes, we are not Republicans or Democrats. We are representatives of the people, and we will do whatever we must to protect our citizens when their lives, homes and property are threatened.","word.count":906,"sep11":-1.23033707865169,"years":2000.62921348315,"days":2004,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0279638364947692,"Topic 2":0.286657797413237,"Topic 3":0.0210103470374956,"Topic 4":0.0417508212800959,"Topic 5":0.0697905148492409,"Topic 6":0.444957970566288,"Topic 7":0.0667142711888373,"Topic 8":0.018318109422878,"Topic 9":0.0186280142960193,"Topic 10":0.00420831745113902},{"id":"10620000064745","body":"Donald Nickles: Mr. President, if it is a refundable credit, we have now turned a tax cut into a spending bill, I would assume spending billions of dollars.

The amendment I asked for would actually go further toward what Thomas Jefferson, George Mason and James Madison had said and used in a lot of our State Constitutions, to make sure we do have freedom of expression.

This bill is yet another unjustifiable attempt by the Federal government to use the war on drugs as an excuse for invading the privacy and liberties of the American people and for expanding the Federal government's disastrous micromanagement of medical care. As a physician with over 30 years experience in private practice, I must oppose this bill due to the danger it poses to our health as well as our liberty. By creating a national database of prescriptions for controlled substances, the Federal government would take another step forward in the war on pain patients and their doctors. This war has already resulted in the harassment and prosecution of many doctors, and their staff members, whose only ``crime'' is prescribing legal medication, including opioids, to relieve their patients' pain. These prosecutions, in turn, have scared other doctors so that they are unwilling to prescribe an adequate amount of pain medication, or even any pain medication, for their suffering patients. Doctors and their staffs may even be prosecuted because of a patient's actions that no doctor approved or even knew about. A doctor has no way of controlling if a patient gives some of the prescribed medication away or consumes a prescribed drug in a dangerous combination with illegal drugs or other prescription drugs obtained from another source. Nonetheless, doctors can be subjected to prosecution when a patient takes such actions. Applying to doctors laws intended to deal with drug kingpins, the government has created the illusion of some success in the war on drugs. Investigating drug dealers can be hard and dangerous work. In comparison, it is much easier to shut down medical practices and prosecute doctors who prescribe pain medication. A doctor who is willing to treat chronic pain patients with medically justified amounts of controlled substances may appear at first look to be excessively prescribing. Because so few doctors are willing to take the drug war prosecution risks associated with treating chronic pain patients, and because chronic pain patients must often consume significant doses of pain medication to obtain relief, the prosecution of one pain doctor can be heralded as a large success. All the government needs to do is point to the large amount of patients and drugs associated with a medical practice. Once doctors know that there is a national database of controlled substances prescriptions that overzealous law enforcement will be scrutinizing to harass doctors, there may be no doctors left who are willing to treat chronic pain. Instead of creating a national database, we should be returning medical regulation to local control, where it historically and constitutionally belongs. Instead of drug warriors regulating medicine with an eye to maximizing prosecutions, we should return to State medical boards and State civil courts review that looks to science-based standards of medical care and patients' best interests. H.R. 3015 also threatens patients' privacy. A patient's medical records should be treated according to the mutual agreement of the patient and doctor. In contrast, H.R. 3015 will put a patient's prescriptions on a government-mandated database that can be accessed without the patient's permission. Instead of further eroding our medical privacy, Congress should take steps to protect it. Why should someone not be able to deny the government and third parties access to his medical records without his permission or a warrant? One way the House can act to protect patients' privacy is by enacting my Patient Privacy Act that repeals the provision of Federal law establishing a medical ID for every American. Under the guise of ``protecting privacy,'' the Health and Human Services' so- called ``medical privacy'' regulations allow medical researchers, insurance agents, and government officials access to your personal medical records--without your consent. Congress should act now to reverse this government-imposed invasion of our medical privacy. Please join me in opposing H.R. 3015--legislation that, if enacted, will make us less free and less healthy.","word.count":186,"sep11":2.10955056179775,"years":2003.9691011236,"days":3193,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.229116745853171,"Topic 2":0.23008566298182,"Topic 3":0.0480956721469699,"Topic 4":0.321451544311012,"Topic 5":0.123117605429125,"Topic 6":0.00544260136160659,"Topic 7":0.0122983546389182,"Topic 8":0.0128150991582511,"Topic 9":0.0105857611873077,"Topic 10":0.00699095293181974},{"id":"10920050050866","body":"John Thune: A lot has been made that we are going to borrow money to pay for this tax.

But for the last 6 months, as we have tried to come to an agreement on this bill, we have reached out to the majority, trying to find common ground, and we have been turned down at every turn.

In 32 of the fraudulent cases, the religious institution either did not exist or only existed on paper, and 39 of their fraudulent petitions included fraudulent supporting documentation or material misrepresentations within a document. Other instances of fraud included cases where the petitioner could not be located or connected to any religious entity and where the petitioning religious entity was unaware that the petition had even been filed and was unaware of the beneficiary. Now that this Nation is involved in a global war on terror, we must be extremely vigilant, Madam Speaker. We must protect the safety and welfare of American citizens. We can't do that with an immigration policy that includes programs ripe with fraud. Another example would be in 2003 Mohammed Khalil and three of his sons were arrested in connection with submitting false applications to bring over 200 individuals to the United States using the Religious Worker Visa program. Prosecutors revealed that Khalil made statements to an undercover witness professing allegiance to Osama bin Laden. He also allegedly stated, ``Hopefully another attack in the United States will come shortly.'' These are the kind of people that we don't need in this program. We must be ever vigilant. This program needed some improvements before it was ready for reauthorization. Historically it has been reauthorized as a 5-year reauthorization. The initial proposal was to reauthorize it to make the program permanent. I appreciate the negotiations that have taken it down to a 7-year reauthorization. I would have preferred it be substantially less. However, information that has been made available to me after such time as we took action on the bill in the Judiciary Committee gives me some hope that USCIS, the U.S. Citizenship Immigration Services, has already taken some steps that likely would have reduced the percentage and certainly reduced the number of fraud cases. As I look at the verbal report from Director Emilio Gonzalez, the 2005 Religious Worker Visa applications were something slightly above 4,000 out of the 5,000 cap that is in the authorization. That was 2005. So that would be the year by which we have seen the highest percentage of fraud in the reports that I have seen, Madam Speaker. In 2006, the applications, by the report language that I received, is 3,048. So we have seen these numbers going down, presumably because of the increased scrutiny on the Religious Worker Visa applications. Then by 2007 we only saw, and this is by a verbal report from the director, 454 Religious Worker Visa applications. That is a dramatic 80-some percent reduction in the number of visa applications. I think it is safe to conclude that a significant amount of this, Madam Speaker, is the result of increased scrutiny on the part of USCIS. We need to be taking a particular look still, and I intend to sit down with Director Gonzalez and talk this through so I can get a full understanding of the decisions they made, the timing of their decisions and how that might have affected the Religious Worker Visa applications. But as I look through their report, I see a couple or three places that we should be looking. One is the special registrant countries. These are the countries that required extra scrutiny post-September 11th, and we know which countries those are. They are listed in the report. That happens to be the source of, depending how you want to evaluate the information, those countries that made those self-attested reports show that either 70 percent, 73 percent or 80 percent were fraudulent in the special registrant countries category. Then the non-affiliated groups, the groups that are not affiliated with a religious denomination, showed 63 percent fraud. That is worthy also of significant scrutiny, and I am hopeful that this has been addressed. And those numbers I believe also are shrinking. Then I looked at, for example, the countries of origin. There was one county that had 100 percent fraud of the report that was issued. That was Jamaica. So these are things that I think are red flags. I intend to sit down and have this conversation with Director Gonzalez and get a better feel for it. But that is the statistics we are dealing with today as this bill to reauthorize and extend for 7 years Religious Worker Visas is before this Congress. Then I would submit also that there is something that is actually missing in our policy. A nation that should be a nation that believes in free trade and smart trade also should believe in free and smart trade of our religious workers. I believe that we should have reciprocity. For us to welcome religious workers from countries that will disallow American religious workers from going to their countries and particular religions that come from America to go to those countries, I think is a great big gap in our oversight. Recognizing the time of this legislation and the inability to offer an amendment in a closed rule, I have drafted a bill, and I have that bill with me today and I won't be able to introduce it unless there is a request for unanimous consent, and I don't intend to do that, but this bill is the Religious Worker Reciprocity Act of 2006. What it does, it just extends reciprocal immigration treatment to nationals of the United States who are seeking resident status in order to work in religious vocation of other countries. In other words, it would simply say you send your religious workers here, we want to be able to send our religious workers there. I think that is the intent. And I would ask for support of that across the bipartisan effort, and particularly those that have taken particular interest in this issue. But I will be introducing that legislation in a subsequent day. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.","word.count":1056,"sep11":6.76404494382022,"years":2008.62359550562,"days":4850,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0473089072325195,"Topic 2":0.0205737183992197,"Topic 3":0.0595751515540531,"Topic 4":0.00609846592818012,"Topic 5":0.098133014927178,"Topic 6":0.0343278645759346,"Topic 7":0.00439481383898947,"Topic 8":0.606785030913903,"Topic 9":0.1096025630748,"Topic 10":0.0132004695552225},{"id":"10920060055742","body":"Tom Harkin: Mr. President, we are awaiting the arrival of a Senator on our side to speak on the stem cell issues. Until that happens, I will take a couple of minutes to talk about something my friend from Kansas brought up earlier today about adult stem cell treatments. I am reading a letter from Scienceexpress, a publication of Science magazine. It is entitled, ``Adult Stem Cell Treatments for Diseases?'' Again, it exposed most of these as kind of being bogus. One of those listed was testicular cancer. Testicular cancer is not being treated with adult stem cells, at least not successfully. In fact, according to the Sciencexpress article, the study that is supposed to be the basis for that claim is actually a study on how to isolate adult stem cells. The Senator from Kansas also has a list that included several leukemias and lymphomas. Let's hear what George Dahlman of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society has to say about that. Mr. Dahlman concludes: All in all, according to the science journal, only nine diseases of the 65 examined have proved to even respond to treatment with adult stem cells. The authors of the analysis conclude that claims about stem cells being in general use for 65 diseases are false. Such claims ``mislead lay people and cruelly deceive patients.'' Again, we are going to hear a lot of talk about all we can do other than embryonic stem cell research. This should not be a debate about whether we do adult stem cells, cord blood, or all these other things. They are all worthy of research. Those that are for adult stem cell research, cord blood, bone marrow research, that type of thing, all say they want to do that to the exclusion of embryonic stem cells. Those who are in support of H.R. 810 say let's do them all and do them all in an ethically acceptable manner. Again, we have strong ethical guidelines. One, we do not create any embryos with this bill. You can only use the embryos that are already existing in IVF clinics that are left over that will be discarded. Second, we must have written informed consent of the donors. Third, no one can get paid; no money can change hands. You cannot entice someone to donate these embryos with money. We have strong ethical guidelines. Lastly, I have heard comments today time and time again about how this bill, H.R. 810, involves the destruction of embryos. I challenge anyone to show me where in H.R. 810 it provides for the destruction of any embryos. Under the Dickey-Wicker amendment that is now existing, no Federal funds can be used to destroy embryos. All H.R. 8l0 says is that once stem cells are derived through private means or whatever, then Federal funds can be used to go to universities or to other researchers to study these embryonic stem cells. There is nothing in this bill, and I challenge anyone to show me in H.R. 810 where it provides for the destruction of any embryos; it does not. To say otherwise is being disingenuous. The Dickey-Wicker amendment still applies. No Federal money can be used for the destruction of embryos, plain and simple. I see my colleague from Illinois is here. I yield the floor.","word.count":548,"sep11":4.97191011235955,"years":2006.83146067416,"days":4212,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0547122577830253,"Topic 2":0.278139955756039,"Topic 3":0.0436613006368486,"Topic 4":0.0238523420347433,"Topic 5":0.0523350021876707,"Topic 6":0.0116271622575704,"Topic 7":0.0185504687966135,"Topic 8":0.425227909616764,"Topic 9":0.0830015132747446,"Topic 10":0.0088920876559806},{"id":"10419960009391","body":"Sheila Jackson-Lee: Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and legislation of H.R. 1833, for the dastardly impact on the life and health of the mother and the fetus and the physicians. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule for H.R. 1833. We must be allowed to offer amendments to H.R. 1833, specifically, those which would provide for a true exception to save a woman's life, or for serious, adverse health consequences to the woman, including her future fertility, or where there exists severe or potentially fatal fetal abnormalities. In 1973, and more recently in 1992, the Supreme Court held that a woman has a constitutional right to choose whether or not to have an abortion. H.R. 1833 is a direct attack on the principles established in both Roe versus Wade and Planned Parenthood versus Casey. H.R. 1833 is a dangerous piece of legislation which would ban a range of late term abortion procedures that are used when a woman's health or life is threatened or when a fetus is diagnosed with severe abnormalities incompatible with life. Because H.R. 1833 does not use medical terminology, it fails to clearly identify which abortion procedures it seeks to prohibit, and as a result could prohibit physicians from using a range of abortion techniques, including those safest for the woman. H.R. 1833 is a direct challenge to Roe versus Wade--1973. This legislation would make it a crime to perform a particular abortion method utilized primarily after the 20th week of pregnancy. This legislation represents an unprecedented and unconstitutional attempt to ban abortion and interfere with physicians' ability to provide the best medical care for their patients. If enacted, such a law would have a devastating effect on women who learn late in their pregnancies that their lives or health are at risk or that the fetuses they are carrying have severe, often fatal, anomalies. Women like Coreen Costello, a loyal Republican and former abortion protester whose baby had a lethal neurological disease; Mary-Dorothy Lines, a conservative Republican who discovered her baby had severe hydrocephalus; Claudia Ades, who terminated her pregnancy in the sixth month because her baby was riddled with fetal anomalies due to a fatal chromosomal disorder, Vicki Wilson, who discovered at 36 weeks that her baby's brain was growing outside his head; Tammy Watts, whose baby had no eyes, and intestines developing outside the body; and Vikki Stella, who discovered at 34 weeks that her baby had nine severe anomalies that would lead to certain death. All these children were wanted but could not survive. These are the women who would be hurt by H.R. 1833--women and their families who face a terrible tragedy--the loss of a wanted pregnancy. In Roe, the Supreme Court established that after viability, abortion may be banned by States as long as an exception is provided in cases in which the woman's life or health is at risk. H.R. 1833 provides no true exceptions for cases in which a banned procedure would be necessary to preserve a women's life or health. The Dole amendment does not cover all cases where a woman's life is in danger. This narrow life exception applies only when a woman's life is threatened by a physical disorder, illness or injury and when no other medical procedure would suffice. By limiting the life exception in this way, the bill would omit the most direct threat to a woman's life in cases involving severe fetal anomalies--the pregnancy itself. In fact, none of the women who submitted testimony during the Senate and House hearings on this bill would have qualified for the procedure under the Dole life exception. Instead, this bill would require physicians to use an alternative life-saving procedure, even if the alternative renders the woman infertile, or increases her risk of infection, shock, or bleeding. Thus, the result of this provision is that women's lives would be jeopardized, not saved. This bill unravels the fundamental constitutional rights that American women have to receive medical treatment that they and their doctors have determined are safest and medically best for them. By seeking to ban a safe and accepted medical technique, Members of Congress are intruding directly into the practice of medicine and interfering with the ability of physicians and patients to determine the best course of treatment. The creation of felony penalties and Federal tort claims for the performance of a specific medical procedure would mark a dramatic and unprecedented expansion of congressional regulation of health care. This bill is bad medicine, bad law, and bad policy. Women facing late term abortions due to risks to their lives, health, or severe fetal abnormalities incompatible with life must be able to make this decision in consultation with their families, their physicians, and their god. Women do not need medical instruction from the government. To criminalize a physician for using a procedure which he or she deems to be safest for the mother is tantamount to legislating malpractice. I urge my colleagues to vote against this rule so that we can offer amendments which would create true life and health exceptions to the bill. These amendments would allow doctors to continue to perform the procedure which they feel is safest for the mother without risk of prosecution. True life and health amendments would ensure that mothers, and families, facing tragic circumstances would continue to receive the best possible, and safest medical care available.","word.count":900,"sep11":-5.60112359550562,"years":1996.25842696629,"days":448,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0497895142063174,"Topic 2":0.308141800292065,"Topic 3":0.0128316061418794,"Topic 4":0.105348556405347,"Topic 5":0.390661127674557,"Topic 6":0.0101238907198792,"Topic 7":0.0458084166795859,"Topic 8":0.0532733797469136,"Topic 9":0.0177136048631987,"Topic 10":0.00630810327025744},{"id":"10820030040270","body":"Alcee Hastings: Reclaiming my time, I agree entirely with the Senator from Connecticut.

Our President has asked specifically that the Democratic leadership pass three bills: Trade promotion, energy, and the economic stimulus bill. It seems to me the leadership has been reluctant to do so. The justification for that is beyond me other than, clearly, it is fair to say the objections, to a large degree, are centered around the energy bill. I will continue my dialog relative to what we are doing. It is Monday afternoon and we have an underlying railroad retirement bill with two amendments: One is cloning and the other is H.R. 4, the energy bill. To make sure anyone that perhaps has misunderstood the statements on the other side relative to the tax portion, in our bill there is no provision for tax increases. That $33 billion in the House bill is not in this version of H.R. 4. The inconsistency is because the Democratic leader has refused to negotiate on the requests of our President: Trade promotion, energy, and the economic stimulus. Instead, he is moving ahead, now with the railroad retirement and the farm bill next. Is it not rather interesting that we cannot at this time get an energy bill up when, clearly, we have a crisis in the Middle East? It is interesting to reflect on the comments associated with the leadership in the Senate. It is clear that the Senator is blocking a vote precisely for one reason. He knows Alaskans have the votes to pass out an energy bill in this body if given an opportunity. Has he given this opportunity to us? Clearly, he has not. He has indicated in several statements: My comment is we will raise the issue, debate it, and have a good opportunity to consider energy legislation prior to the Founders Day break in mid-February. If the leader would conclude by suggesting we would resolve it by then, in other words, by Founders' Day, or at some specific time, then I think we could have a fair vote. All we are asking is for a fair vote on the issue. He indicated further: There will be votes on ANWR, but I'm not at this point ready to commit to an up-or-down vote. He is saying we will have to overcome a cloture vote. We cannot have a simple majority vote. The inconsistency goes further. Senator Stevens references several items; I go back to a personal item, the attitude of the people living in the North Slope of Alaska. Those who have gone up there and taken advantage of the invitation have come back with the sincere appreciation and understanding that these people are Americans, they have a right to life, they have a right to look towards a future based on reasonable economic development prospects, health benefits, and so forth. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record upon completion of my statement a letter from the president of the Arctic Slope Corporation.","word.count":505,"sep11":0.23314606741573,"years":2002.09269662921,"days":2525,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.930148488162597,"Topic 2":0.0235938409251598,"Topic 3":0.0047600303532184,"Topic 4":0.0123148764030791,"Topic 5":0.00485798267856395,"Topic 6":0.00528346713583606,"Topic 7":0.00375833716306963,"Topic 8":0.00859411027241203,"Topic 9":0.0046693205837839,"Topic 10":0.0020195463222804},{"id":"10419950106643","body":"John McCain: I respond to my friend from Iowa, I do not know the amount of money.

It is no secret that Iraq is of particular importance because of its oil. The United States consumes 20.6 billion barrels of oil per day. Yet we produce only 5.1 billion barrels of oil a day. China is the second largest consumer, with 6.9 million barrels per day, and they produce 3.6 million barrels per day. Iraq has the fourth largest oil reserve in the world. Saudi Arabia is number one, Canada number two and Iran number three. So all of us agree Iraq is important. But how do we get to a conclusion? Let me compare Gulf War I with Gulf War II. In Gulf War I, Kuwait was attacked by Saddam Hussein. It was a brutal attack. President Bush I immediately reacted. He sent his emissary, Secretary Cheney, to Saudi Arabia. They got an agreement from Saudi Arabia to use their land to put troops in. He immediately sent in the Airborne Division, and he immediately sent in F-16 fighters to deter Saddam Hussein. All of us knew that there was a possibility at that time that he would have complete control of the oil in the Middle East. So we knew how important it was. Then President Bush started calling up the Reserves. He called a number of Members of Congress over to the White House, and he consulted and talked to them. I do not remember if the gentleman from Illinois was there, but there were seven or eight of us went to the White House. We talked to him about calling up the Reserves and having other people pay. This is important not only to the United States. This is important internationally. This oil supply, this stability in the Middle East is important to the whole world, and he went to work. He called every major nation. He called Egypt, and this was no easy task for these countries to come around to decide to support the United States. Matter of fact, President Mubarak said to me that King Hussein came to him and said if you support the United States, you will cut the throat of Saddam Hussein, and yet Egypt decided that they were going to go along with us. Then he talked about that we needed to have a U.N. resolution, which we did have. Then we had to have a resolution in the Congress of the United States. But the big thing that he promoted was he got a coalition together, and this coalition ended up with 400,000 American troops and 160,000 coalition troops. And I remember during this debate, I remember calling Secretary Cheney, calling General Scowcroft saying, you have got 250,000 troops over there, you don't need any more. Let's get this war going. And General Scowcroft said something I have never forgotten. He said, we are going to give General Schwarzkopf whatever he wants. He wants more troops, we are going to give him more troops. And Secretary Cheney called me and said we are going to have to send another 180,000 troops. We are going to have overwhelming force when we go into Kuwait. And they did have overwhelming force. It went on for 6 months. The troops were out in the field, they trained, and when they went in they did a magnificent thing. It was overwhelming. And it was paid for by other countries. Sixty billion dollars came from other countries. President Bush I convinced other countries that they had to help pay for this because it was not only important to the United States, it was important to them, the stability in the Middle East. Now, let me talk about the second Gulf War. The second Gulf War we had intelligence that said there were weapons of mass destruction; there was an al Qaeda connection. I believed that. As a matter of fact, I listened to the reports, and I was hesitant about the al Qaeda connection, but I believed that they had biological weapons. Matter of fact, a week or so before the war started, Ms. Pelosi, as the new minority leader, wanted to go overseas on her first trip. She wanted to visit the troops. Even though she had been against the resolution to go to war, she wanted to tell the troops she supported the troops. And anybody that votes for the Defense Subcommittee appropriations, anybody that belongs to the Armed Services Committee shows their support of the troops. So we went over, and on our way over we stopped in Turkey. Imagine, the 4th Division was sitting outside Turkey. It was supposed to outflank the Iraqis. And the State Department asked me, okay, talk to the Turkish government about letting us go through. Now, we had the most modern division, the most technologically advanced division in the whole world sitting there off Turkey. I talked to them and I became convinced they weren't going to let us go through, even though they had voted the very day I was there, and they voted by a majority, but not the supermajority they needed to allow the United States to go through. I went then to Kuwait and we listened to the commanders. The commanders told us that there is a red line drawn around Baghdad and if we cross the red line they are going to use biological weapons. And I believed that. I believed. As a matter of fact, they said if you cross this red line, we have already verified this by monitoring their telephones, by monitoring their cell phones. When we monitored cell phones of Saddam Hussein's headquarters they said use biological weapons. The troops believed it. They were prepared. They felt like they could go in there with protective gear, they could go in there with what they needed and the hot air, the winds, would dissipate the weapons. And, of course, they crossed the red line and nothing happened. But I still thought there were weapons of mass destruction. I still thought there were biological weapons. I came back and we sent a team over there. And the team went over and the team looked for those weapons of mass destruction. Matter of fact, at first a fella named Kay, that was so strong about it, former CIA, said, we will find them. And he looked for months and couldn't find anything at all. Absolutely no evidence of any kind of weapons of mass destruction. No biological weapon, no capability, no nuclear capability, no al Qaeda connection. When we go to war, we should go to war, first of all, if it is a threat to our national security. It was a threat to our national security when you talk about the first war, because it destabilized and he would have controlled all the oil in the Middle East, which is so important to the free world. The second time was no threat to our national security. Now, we didn't find that out, those of us who voted for it, didn't find this out until after we had gone to war. The second thing is you go with overwhelming force. I talked to one of the commanders who was in a meeting with five officials; there was him, there was Secretary Rumsfeld, there was Secretary Wolfowitz, General Pace, and General Myers. And he said we recommended 350,000 troops. And as you know, they gave him a lot less troops than that. The coalition troops at the most were up to 30,000 and now they are down to 20,000. The first war, 160,000. And the first war was all paid for. It cost us $5 billion. The reason I remember this so vividly is I was chairman of the committee at the time the money came through our committee, and we then sent it over, reprogrammed it over to the Defense Department itself. But the discrepancy that we have seen, the mischaracterization, the optimistic predictions are the problems that I have had. Now, I sent a letter, with Duncan Hunter and a number of other people, and I said to the President, we need 100,000 more troops. Well, the President decided he didn't need 100,000 more troops. Now, imagine this, we are on the ground and we have won the war. The troops did a magnificent job, as we knew they would, but they completely miscalculated the problems that we were going to have afterwards. Now, I talked to a tribal leader the other day in Anbar Province. He told me that, as far as he saw, the first 6 months we had occupied Anbar. Now, Anbar is the province we are having the most trouble right now. It is where Ramadi and Fallujah are. Those are the areas where there is the most contention. In the first 6 months there wasn't a shot fired. Not a shot fired. I said, let me ask you right now, what kind of progress have we made economically? No water, no electricity, no jobs in Anbar Province. Two million people. And we talk about Saddam Hussein. Almost 900,000 people left when Saddam Hussein was there. They left the country as refugees. The time we have been there 900,000 people have left the country. They voted with their feet. The President went in the other day, he says he was glad to see democracy in action. You know where he went? The same place I go, in the fortress. In the Green Zone. That is where he went. They are afraid to go outside the Green Zone. When I first went there, the first two or three trips I went, I could go anyplace. I drove around all over Iraq. The last time I landed at Baghdad Airport, they flew me to Anbar Province down in Haditha, and we flew so low because of the threat we had to come up over the wires in order to get down, and I didn't see a person the whole time. There were 2 million people in Anbar Province. Not one project. Not one. I said on the floor of the House the most important thing in that first supplemental, in the $87 billion, was the $18 billion that went for reconstruction. And of course there are so many projects that haven't been finished. Now, after we sent the letter about the 100,000, and during that period of time, we asked a fella named Hamre, who was the former Under Secretary of Defense, who went over to Iraq and he did a study for the Defense Department. He came back and said, you have got 3 to 6 months to get this straightened out. And what did he suggest had to be done? They weren't big projects. He suggested we had to have trash picked up, sewage taken care of, electricity, and jobs. Those are the kinds of things he talked about, ","word.count":3574,"sep11":4.88202247191011,"years":2006.74157303371,"days":4180,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0128044410351868,"Topic 2":0.0318773915627567,"Topic 3":0.051954854951826,"Topic 4":0.00459311464356546,"Topic 5":0.0115188576781333,"Topic 6":0.582848440403347,"Topic 7":0.00652425046932657,"Topic 8":0.217111619443298,"Topic 9":0.0751718073562172,"Topic 10":0.00559522245634356},{"id":"10820040006484","body":"Brad Sherman: I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his dedication to the importance of assuring the continuity of our government. We here in Washington have erected these concrete barriers, blocking this road, blocking Pennsylvania Avenue, all to assure the survival of our physical embodiment of our government. We must make sure that we have done just as much to protect the identity of those who will make the decisions. Our laws should be as strong as our concrete barriers. In the post-September 11 world, that which was just thought to be a distant possibility must now be something that we plan for. The line of Presidential succession determines who becomes President after the President and the Vice President if they are both permanently or temporarily unable to carry out their duties. We can change this without amending the Constitution. It is the 1947 Presidential Succession Act which currently governs. In fact, going back to the statute that existed before 1947 would be a substantial step in the right direction and would deal with many of the problems that I will identify here tonight. Not only is this an issue that we can solve without amending our Constitution, it is one that is critically important to solve for two reasons. First, as important as Congress is, and I am proud to serve in this body, in the days following a catastrophic attack, knowing the identity of the Commander in Chief will be perhaps the most important legal issue to deal with that crisis. And, second, while it would take a nuclear bomb, perhaps, to destroy a majority of the Members of the House or the Members of the Senate, it does not take anywhere near such a catastrophe to have the President and the Vice President not able to serve. In fact, John Wilkes Booth came within an inch of doing it in 1865, and he did not have any nuclear weapons. Yes, he killed President Lincoln. He also tried to kill the Secretary of State and the Vice President of the United States. Those other assassination attempts failed. So muskets or hand revolvers have been sufficient to bring us close to a position where we would move through the line of succession. What is that line of succession now? Right after the Vice President is the Speaker of this House. That creates a few problems, illustrated in a ``West Wing'' scenario. It was as if ``West Wing'' had focused on the bill that I introduced to this Congress very early in 2001. In that scenario, you had no Vice President serving, the Speaker of the House was of another political party, and the President was only temporarily incapacitated. What happened on television was not quite believable to those of us who live in the politically charged atmosphere here in Washington. The President temporarily gave up the Presidency to a person of another political party, voluntarily and under a circumstance where he would have legitimately continued to retain the Presidency, but he thought that the kidnapping of his daughter in this scenario made him too preoccupied to serve. What about the real Washington? Would a President whose family circumstance makes it difficult or impossible to continue to serve temporarily give up the White House to somebody of the opposite philosophy? One can only imagine the aides coming and saying, Mr. President, don't do it. There will be 500 pieces of legislation signed into law within the first hour of your incapacity. In addition, under this scenario, the Speaker agreed to assume the presidency, had to resign his seat in the Congress, served as President for only a day or two, and then left public service. Would every Speaker of this House be willing to resign their seat in Congress for an hour or two or a day or two in the White House? And if not, what does that do to our system? The answer is that we must maintain a system in which the philosophy that governs in the White House is the same throughout a 4-year term in office. This is important for a number of reasons. First, let us say the office of Vice President was vacant. Our friends wonder whether a heart attack or an assassination could suddenly change the direction of America. The stock markets wonder whether all economic policy could change with one ill-fated bad effect on one man or woman's health. Not a good situation. We should have continuity of philosophy in the White House throughout the 4-year term. Not only that, it encourages assassins. Imagine either a group of fanatics or an individual lunatic believing they could justify their act because they were not just killing an individual man or woman, they were radically changing the philosophy that governed here in Washington. Who is fourth in line? Fourth in line is the President pro tempore of the Senate. Yes, that means Mr. Strom Thurmond. An individual who served this country quite long as a United States Senator in his 98th year was third in line to serve as President of the United States. Could al Qaeda come up with a better plan than the death of three individuals vesting the presidency in a man who at that time had seen better days? I think that in a world of suicide assassins, we are negligent in our duties if we do not revisit the 1947 Presidential Succession Act. There will be those who say we have muddled along so far without having to worry about this. Clearly, the events of 9/11 illustrate that we have to protect ourselves not just from what has happened but from that which might happen. There are a number of possible solutions. I put before this House, in I believe it was February of 2001, a bill which I reintroduced in the current Congress that would provide two things: First, it would deal with one final problem I have not had a chance to identify here and a problem that is also substantial. That is a current law not only goes through a list of those who would succeed to the presidency that causes the problems I have outlined but is also unclear particularly in the circumstance in which someone succeeds to the presidency because they were third, fourth, or fifth on the list and then someone else is confirmed or elected to be second on the list. What happens if there is no Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore succeeds to the presidency and then this body meets and elects a Speaker? Do we bump the person who succeeded only because they held that less-high-in-line position? That is something we need to clarify in our statutes. So I presented a bill that solved that problem and identified that, once somebody became President, they stayed as President through the end of that term, and also identified that the second in line to serve would be either the Speaker or the minority leader, whichever was designated by the President, and whoever would serve after that would be either the majority or the minority leader of the other body. What this would assure under this scenario is that whoever succeeded to the presidency would have been elected by their State or district and selected by their colleagues for a position of national leadership, not as the President pro tempore is for a position of ceremonial honor. Another solution, a simpler one, is to simply take Congress out of it, have the line of succession go through the Cabinet. A final idea put forward by Norm Ornstein, a scholar who has studied in this area, is to create a list of several governors selected by the elected President to be in line of succession and have them become Federal officers by giving them a ceremonial position perhaps as head of their own National Guards so that they could be in line. As the gentleman from Washington pointed out, it may be that we do not want the line of succession to go all through the Cabinet even to Cabinet officers not well known by the American people so a hybrid solution would be that the line of succession would go through the top five or six Cabinet officers and then to a list of five governors selected and ranked in a document filed with the House and the Senate by the then serving and inaugurated President. So there are several ways to solve this constellation of problems. There is one thing that it is simply criminally negligent for us to do, and that is to ignore the problem until it happens. To do so invites assassination. To do so invites people around the world to wonder whether there will be a sudden shift in policy or whether the United States will be temporarily unable to respond because the identity of its President cannot be determined with a legitimacy that is accepted by all the American people. It is time for us to act on the Presidential Succession Act of 1947 and to adopt the amendments or a change of it this year. I thank the gentleman for his great generosity in yielding to me.","word.count":1535,"sep11":2.61516853932584,"years":2004.47471910112,"days":3373,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0156650786255036,"Topic 2":0.533758618942055,"Topic 3":0.00592530482263079,"Topic 4":0.0207573159159621,"Topic 5":0.00952042218339068,"Topic 6":0.00593431172413512,"Topic 7":0.0107957984435734,"Topic 8":0.0653424743716669,"Topic 9":0.325327327369029,"Topic 10":0.00697334760205241},{"id":"10820030056995","body":"Zell Miller: Mr. President, this is for 1 year.

To the citizens of his beloved Wyoming and to his colleagues in the Senate, he was a cherished friend. Although my State and his are miles apart, with vastly different geography and history, I am struck by the similarities in the character of our people. Both the rugged Maine Yankee and the tough Wyoming cowboy are steadfast and modest. Both are determined, committed to doing what is right rather than what is easy. An old cowboy proverb says, ``The best way out of a tight spot is to go straight through it,'' and Craig Thomas always faced challenges head-on. I have no doubt that he would have been just as at home on the deck of a lobster boat as he was on horseback, riding the range. As a Senator representing a large rural State, I deeply appreciate Craig's devotion to preserving and enhancing a way of life that is such a vital part of the American spirit. His tireless work on such issues as agriculture, Indian affairs, natural resources, rural health care, and educational opportunity will help ensure a better future for people in small communities throughout our nation.

And that is absolutely the economy that we all support and know and revere. And it has served us well through more than 200 years. But because we live in a capitalistic society, it does not mean that we should be throwing our children, our most vulnerable, to the wolves but for the accident of their birth.","word.count":169,"sep11":6.76123595505618,"years":2008.62078651685,"days":4849,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0831151896104059,"Topic 2":0.238647120614156,"Topic 3":0.00598458496412439,"Topic 4":0.00511354266981431,"Topic 5":0.0155974002226889,"Topic 6":0.431230395506803,"Topic 7":0.00475848297963858,"Topic 8":0.111310400441633,"Topic 9":0.0581116477876514,"Topic 10":0.0461312352030856},{"id":"10619990003680","body":"James Hansen: Mr. Chairman, I applaud the enthusiasm of the Committee on International Relations to bring forward something to at least focus the Nation's attention on the energy price increase we have had in the","word.count":816,"sep11":-2.57022471910112,"years":1999.2893258427,"days":1527,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.170862388762184,"Topic 2":0.200204811748365,"Topic 3":0.0249067486469942,"Topic 4":0.0078872004478043,"Topic 5":0.0135648787838635,"Topic 6":0.51823500519437,"Topic 7":0.00865419890420814,"Topic 8":0.0369991351358709,"Topic 9":0.0148728721511591,"Topic 10":0.00381276022518063},{"id":"10519970076046","body":"Wayne Allard: Senator McConnell, I am confident that the Justice Department and the National Association of Attorneys General will vigorously enforce this legislation.","word.count":947,"sep11":-4.12640449438202,"years":1997.73314606742,"days":973,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.854901915543068,"Topic 2":0.0505810498077899,"Topic 3":0.00994401702330276,"Topic 4":0.0233678689343687,"Topic 5":0.0104626879195712,"Topic 6":0.0101512303739248,"Topic 7":0.00820325027376509,"Topic 8":0.0172309492340984,"Topic 9":0.0107074974169159,"Topic 10":0.00444953347319537},{"id":"10820030028910","body":"Randy 'Duke' Cunningham: Mr. Chairman, I rise to support the Capito amendment.

I ask unanimous consent that my statement and bill be printed in the Record. This legislation stems from the need to address our Nation's current and future fiscal health. The fact is, we are in dire straits. In the simplest terms, the Federal Government continues to spend more than it takes in. In case anyone has forgotten, the deficit for fiscal year 2005 was $318 billion--the third largest deficit in our Nation's history. If we were to take out the Social Security surplus, the deficit would be nearly $500 billion. And if we were to use accrual accounting, the accounting method used by American businesses, the deficit would be approximately $760 billion. These deficits only continue to add to our national debt. When I came to the Senate in 1999, the national debt stood at $5.6 trillion. Since then, it has increased 50 percent to $8.4 trillion. As a percentage of Gross Domestic Product, GDP, our national debt has grown from being 58 percent of GDP at the end of 2000 to an estimated 66.1 percent of GDP by the end of 2006. In fact, the debt continues to grow so quickly that the House of Representative's fiscal year 2007 budget resolution raises the Federal debt ceiling to nearly $10 trillion. This is only a few months after Congress was forced to raise the debt ceiling. These ongoing deficits, coupled with the expected tidal wave of entitlement spending, will soon put our Nation in a very unenviable position if thoughtful action is not taken. Moreover, the trust funds for Medicare and Social Security will be exhausted even earlier than previously thought. According to the most recent trustees' report, the cost of Social Security and Medicare will grow from nearly 7.4 percent of the economy today to 12.7 percent by 2030, consuming approximately 70 percent of all Federal revenues, crowding out all other discretionary spending and some other mandatory programs. While entitlements are a major component of our Nation's future fiscal health, it is not the only portion. Just as we must look at how we must reform our entitlement programs to maintain our nation's competitiveness, we must also review our arcane Tax Code. What we should be doing is spending our time on tax reform. We all know that fundamental tax reform is critical. Just as we know the entitlement tidal wave is coming, we know that more and more middle class American families are being swept up in the AMT. So I simply cannot understand why some of my colleagues want to make so many provisions of the current Tax Code permanent or add new tax cuts when we very well may be eliminating precisely the same provisions as part of fundamental tax reform. No homeowner would remodel their kitchen and bathroom right before tearing down the house to build a newer and better one. Simplifying the code to make it more fair and honest could, by some estimates, save taxpayers over $265 billion in costs associated with preparing their taxes. That would be a real tax reduction, and it would not cost the Treasury one dime. It would be a tax cut that would guarantee that people are paying their fair share and would bring more money into the Federal Treasury. Anyone in the know who is watching us has got to wonder about our character, our intellectual honesty, our concern about our national security, our Nation's competitiveness in the global marketplace now and in the future, and last but not least, our ``don't-give-a-dam'' attitude about the standard of living and quality of life of our children and grandchildren. We know the long-term fiscal challenges that are facing our nation. We know that if we continue to move forward blindly, we will walk off a cliff. The simple fact is that we can't have it all--we need to set priorities and make hard choices--otherwise our children will end up paying for it. Last week I voted against the repeal of the estate tax and called on Congress to heed Americans' demand for fundamental tax and entitlement reform. The SAFE Act shows that I am serious about making this a priority for Congress. The legislation will establish a commission comprised of 15 voting members, 3 of which will be appointed by the President, 3 by the Senate majority leader, 3 by the Senate minority leader, 3 by the Speaker of the House and 3 by the House minority leader. The Director of the Congressional Budget Office and the Comptroller General of the United States will be appointed as nonvoting ex-officio members of the Commission to lend their expertise. The Commission will bring together the best minds associated with budget and economic policies to examine the long-term fiscal challenges facing the United States and recommend reforms. A minimum of six public town hall meetings will be held throughout the country within year to determine the scope of the problem and consider solutions. At the conclusion of the town meetings, the Commission will present a report to Congress detailing the fiscal problems facing future generations as well as a framework of long-term solutions. Within 60 days of the presentation of their report to Congress, the Commission will transmit to Congress a legislative proposal designed to: address the imbalance between long-term Federal spending commitments and projected revenues; increase net national savings to spur domestic investment and economic growth; and improve the budget process to place greater emphasis on long-term fiscal issues. The administration and Congress will each have 120 days to review the proposal and develop equivalent proposals if they deem necessary. Congress would then be required to vote on the proposals. America's fiscal situation is dire. Nothing is off the table when it comes to ensuring our longterm prosperity and increasing our competitiveness in the global marketplace. The task is daunting, but now is the time to act. I am thinking not only about the present, but about our children and grandchildren and the legacy--or burden--we will leave them.

I do so for one very particular reason. According to the National League of POW/MIA families, there are currently 1,798 personnel missing, still missing, from a Vietnam war that ended about 35 years ago. These families have continued to meet with resistance from the communist Vietnamese Government and have failed to allow them to adequately search for their loved ones. Yet today, this legislation will reward that country and that government. I believe that is unacceptable. I think we should be talking about how to reward Vietnam for its good conduct if they were to cooperate fully with the efforts to recover these individuals. We have within the Department of Defense an office that is called the Defense POW Missing Personnel Office, whose sole purpose is to help account for these missing personnel that we lost during that conflict. Yet of the hundreds of individuals that accompanied President Bush on his visit to Vietnam last month, the director of that organization was excluded from the visit. What does this say to the Vietnamese Government? I think it says we are not serious about the issue. Today, I think we can honestly say that if we intend to honor those who gave their lives and their sacrifice for our country, we should be willing to confront the Government of Vietnam concerning these missing POW/MIAs. Until Vietnam fully cooperates in that effort with these families to recover their loved ones, I cannot support the normalization on a permanent basis of trade relations with that country, and I would urge my colleagues to do likewise.","word.count":303,"sep11":5.37640449438202,"years":2007.23595505618,"days":4356,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.622484908770502,"Topic 2":0.0212319102804667,"Topic 3":0.00979566228109721,"Topic 4":0.0461354638669018,"Topic 5":0.00339818269851102,"Topic 6":0.267310040115012,"Topic 7":0.0068180580937511,"Topic 8":0.0126305352498316,"Topic 9":0.00856880725669328,"Topic 10":0.00162643138723394},{"id":"10419950079346","body":"Bob Dole: Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Byrd for that statement and also for cosponsoring this legislation, and for the outstanding research that he did, putting it in a historical perspective, as well.

We promote basic academics and encourage parental involvement, not replace the role of children's parents in their lives. We support locally designed accountability standards, not mandated Federal testing. We have tried to drive at least 95 cents of every Federal dollar directly to the classroom, not bureaucracies bloated by expanding the Federal role in neighborhood schools. Mr. Speaker, the liberals have made it clear that in a Democrat Congress the education focus would once again shift back to the vision of big government, Washington-knows-best approach to dealing with local education issues. Americans know better. They care about education and they are concerned about whether students are learning, whether they can read at grade level, and whether they are learning to add and subtract.

Finally, employer-sponsored plans, labor-union sponsored plans, will be penalized under this legislation. There will be a disincentive for employers and labor unions to continue their coverage. You might ask, why? I will answer that question. Because now, under this legislation before us, they have revamped the standard for how you calculate your out-of-pocket cost for the catastrophic level of $3,300. These plans will not be counted toward the out-of-pocket costs. So employers will not have an incentive to continue these programs. And certainly employees would not want to because they would not want to lose their coverage. Labor unions will drop their plans. So that is another disincentive. Now 23 percent of retirees have such coverage. We do not want to create a disincentive for the continuation of those programs. But that is exactly what this Graham proposal will do that is before this Senate today. That is why I am urging my colleagues not to support this initiative. Allow us to go back to where we were on Friday, continuing the discussions we were holding across the aisle with our tripartisan group, with Senator Breaux, Senator Jeffords, Senator Grassley, Senator Hatch, Senator Baucus, Senator Kennedy, Senator Wyden, and others, so that we can have a comprehensive plan for all Medicare beneficiaries, with universal coverage that the AARP and all of us have embraced for the last 37 years with the existence of the Medicare Program. This isn't the last vote. This can be the beginning.

The treaty does not destroy a single Russian warhead. It talks about downgrading, reducing, downloading, retiring, converting--all actions that can be reversed. The Russians do not have to destroy the warheads. I wondered also what would happen to those warheads if Russia should decide to comply with the START II treaty--this is a big ``if,'' since they have not complied with other treaties--but if they did, what would happen to those warheads if they were, for example, to download them? We all know the financial needs of the former Soviet Union, Russia in particular. And we also know that there is a market for those warheads in hostile areas of the world--in the Middle East, North Korea, China, all throughout the world. You have to ask: what would happen to those warheads? We are looking at an agreement that allows Russia to continue modernization, build heavy missiles for 7 more years, and new submarine-launched missiles, and new land missiles, including a hard- to-find mobile missile that even the United States does not have. It allows them to conduct aggressive military exercises and to increase anti-U.S. intelligence. I feel that no effective verification or enforcement could be put in place with this treaty, even if the Russians should comply with it. But let us look at the history. People assume they are going to comply with the START II treaty but they did not comply with the START I treaty, they did not comply with the biological weapons convention, with the chemical weapons convention, the INF treaty, the ABM Treaty. Just around Christmastime Pavel Grachev, who is the Minister of Defense for Russia, made a statement that they did not intend to comply with our Conventional Forces Europe treaty, the CFE treaty. Their reason for not complying, he said, was that the CFE Treaty was not a treaty made between the United States and Russia, but between the United States and the USSR. I would ask why, if that is true, are we so compelled to comply with the ABM Treaty, which also was not between the United States and Russia, but was ratified in 1972 when Russia was still the Soviet Union? So I have to ask the question, why is it so important, at this particular time, to have the START II treaty? Let us look at what has happened just recently. I know we all rejoiced just a few years ago when Boris Yeltsin and the reformers took control. But look what happened just in the last election, last December, of the Duma. The Communists, now, have 157 seats; Boris Yeltsin and the Reform Party, only 55 seats; the person I think most people here dread more than anyone else, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, his party, the Ultranationalists, took 51 seats. So he is almost even with Yeltsin's party, and it is just one-third of what the Communists now have. So, it is a totally different environment right now in Russia from 1993, when the START II treaty was signed by President Bush and President Yeltsin. I think, when you realize that we are ratifying a flawed agreement with a country that has never lived up to previous agreements, and that we are accepting Russia's demands that we remain naked to missile attacks from all over the world, that this is wrong. On December 28 President Clinton vetoed the defense authorization bill. His prime objection to this bill was that we were spending money on a national missile defense system. In his message he declared that this might violate the 1972 ABM Treaty, which prevents the deployment of a multiple-site missile defense system in the United States. Clinton stated that the missile defense plan ``* * * puts the United States policy on a collision course with the ABM Treaty and puts at risk continued Russian implementation of the START I treaty and Russian ratification of the START II treaty.'' Our President rejects a national missile defense system. He says that U.S. national security in the post-cold-war world rests on two treaties, the ABM Treaty and the START treaty, both negotiated at the height of the cold war. That is the linkage the President is making. We can argue whether or not there is a linkage between the ABM Treaty and the START II treaty, but in fact the President thinks there is. He has stated that there is, and he accepts the Russians' linkage between these treaties, which says that we must abide by one, the ABM Treaty, to get the other, the START treaty. You might ask yourself the question: why is it that Russia is so interested in those two treaties? First of all, I have serious doubts that they would comply with the START II treaty. Maybe they have doubts that they would, too. But it seems to me they are bent on our agreeing to reduce our nuclear capability, which they would do to, and at the same time they are even more interested in the ABM Treaty. I think this is something we really have not talked about enough. The ABM Treaty was one that was put together in a Republican administration. It was Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger's project. Dr. Kissinger was the architect of the ABM Treaty of 1972. In 1972 we had two superpowers in this world. Mr. President, we could identify who the enemy was. At that time it seemed to be a good idea. I did not agree with it at the time, but I certainly did not question the wisdom of President Nixon and of Dr. Kissinger, because it seemed that a policy of mutual assured destruction was in the best interests of the United States. Simply put, that is a policy that says: we agree not to defend ourselves and not to implement a national missile defense system if you agree to do the same thing. That way, the risk of complete destruction keeps us from attacking each other. You may believe that this was not a good idea at the time. I did not think it was a good idea. But there is certainly some justification for it. That is not the environment that we are in today. In fact, Henry Kissinger himself has said that it is insane to continue with this type of policy in today's environment when you have the proliferation of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction all throughout the world. It was Kissinger who said, and this is a direct quote: ``It is nuts to make a virtue out of our vulnerability.'' People have made several references to the fact that President Reagan actually started some of the START negotiations. But I would recall the 1986 Reagan-Gorbachev summit in Iceland. It was really the defining moment in the cold war. Gorbachev proposed to eliminate all nuclear weapons and everyone was all excited. But then he established the condition that President Reagan would have to kill the Strategic Defense Initiative, a plan for a national missile defense system. In other words, he said we will agree to doing away with and destroying all nuclear weapons if you agree to make yourself vulnerable to an attack. Reagan walked away from the bad agreement in order to save the United States missile defense program. We are faced with the same choice. Our President currently is embracing that very notion that Reagan rejected, even though, since 1986, the missile threat has greatly increased and Russia has violated treaty after treaty. We have to ask, what is so good about the tradeoff now? Mr. President, I will make this brief because I have made this statement on the floor so many times before. I have deep concern about what is happening right now with our attitude toward a national missile defense system. It is kind of interesting--all these people who come in and want to talk about how bad a national missile defense system is always use such words as ``Star Wars,'' trying to make it look like something that is mythical, something that is science fiction. In fact, anyone who was watching TV during the Persian Gulf war knows that the technology of knocking missiles down with missiles is something that is alive and well. President Clinton appointed Jim Woolsey to be CIA Director, and he was certainly privileged to more information, or as much as anyone else in the world, concerning this Nation's defense. And he said that there are between 20 and 25 nations around the world who currently have, or are developing, weapons of mass destruction, either nuclear, chemical, or biological, and are developing the missile means to deliver those weapons of mass destruction. So there is a greater threat. Most people who are watching the security scene today believe there is a greater threat facing America today than there was during the cold war, because now we are not talking about one enemy, we are talking about 25 or so countries that are developing this technology. If anyone is comfortable in what is happening right now, I suggest that you read last Wednesday's New York Times. I will not submit this for the Record because I did so yesterday when I first read it. I was still in some degree of shock. The New York Times provides fresh evidence of the folly of leaving America vulnerable to ballistic missile attack. In an article entitled--listen to this--``As China threatens Taiwan, it makes sure United States listens--'' the Times reports on ominous information recently passed to National Security Adviser Anthony Lake concerning measures being taken by Beijing to facilitate military action against Taiwan, and points to statements intended to detour the United States from coming to Taipei's assistance. Referring to Charles Freeman--he is a former U.S. Ambassador to China, now Assistant Secretary of Defense--the article reports that ``A Chinese official told him of the advanced state of military planning and that preparations for a missile attack on Taiwan and the target selection to carry it out have been completed and await final decision by the politburo in Beijing.'' Freeman reportedly told Lake that ``A Chinese official asserted that China could act militarily against Taiwan without fear of intervention ","word.count":355,"sep11":-6.28932584269663,"years":1995.5702247191,"days":203,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.926271058983586,"Topic 2":0.0265145057880351,"Topic 3":0.00492931045405061,"Topic 4":0.0120828768591942,"Topic 5":0.00537191889975216,"Topic 6":0.00538778119411463,"Topic 7":0.00390848050105961,"Topic 8":0.00859728301045064,"Topic 9":0.00483780822096074,"Topic 10":0.00209897608879593},{"id":"10920050067207","body":"Sam Brownback: Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to William Rehnquist, 16th Chief Justice of the United States. That is the title, Chief Justice of the United States. While the ceremony honoring him goes forward I think it is appropriate that we in this body recognize his incredible service to the Nation. His biography, where he came from and what he did, has been spoken of a great deal. What I wanted to speak about is not only that, but also his personal impact on me, one that he wouldn't have known or known about. As a young law student in the early 1980s at the University of Kansas, I can remember studying constitutional law and other areas where his opinions came forth. Frequently, in those days he was in the minority opinion role. Many of my law school professors would say: Can you believe what this guy wrote? I remember reading his opinions and thinking his opinion seemed very logical. It seems to me, he believed in holding with the great traditions of being a nation of the rule of law, not the rule of man. The Constitution is a textural document. Chief Justice Rehnquist had a big impact on me in his writings and what he believed we stood for as a nation. He has had a big impact on this Nation, and he will be sorely missed. He was genteel in all of his dealings. Even when he presided in the Senate over the impeachment trial for President Clinton, he did so in a very stately, gentle fashion. Just his presence was one of a man at peace with himself, who knew what he was about, and knew his role and his duty. He fulfilled his duty to the best of his abilities as Chief Justice, Associate Justice on the Supreme Court, as presiding over an impeachment trial, and working with clerks. I think one of most telling things for an individual is what the people say that worked for you, and particularly those who worked for you perhaps in a lower capacity. It seems uniform that the clerks for Chief Justice Rehnquist admired the man while they worked for him. It is a tribute to him how well they worked together and how he helped form them. There is a great symmetry about this in John Roberts being nominated now, as a former clerk of Chief Justice Rehnquist, and now nominated to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court left by his former boss. John Roberts is an outstanding nomination to the Chief Justice position. I hope we can move forward with in an expeditious fashion, certainly thorough, but in an expeditious fashion. That is not what we are here today to talk about. Today it is to talk about and to reflect upon an amazing American in William Rehnquist. He grew up in the suburbs of Milwaukee, WI. His father was the son of Swedish immigrant parents, worked as a paper salesman. His mother was a multilingual professional translator. Shortly after graduation from high school, Chief Justice Rehnquist enlisted in the Air Force and during World War II served as a weather observer in North Africa. On completion of his service in the Air Force, the Chief Justice began his undergraduate work at Stanford University. Yes, he did it on the GI bill. In 1952, Rehnquist graduated first in his class from Stanford Law School, certainly a monumental accomplishment, an accomplishment of great discipline. Following law school, he clerked for former Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson. In 1953, he began work at a law firm in Phoenix, and his brilliance was noted by the Nixon Deputy Attorney General at that time, Richard Kleindienst. On October 22, 1971 President Richard Nixon, nominated him to serve as an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court. He was confirmed less than 2 months later, which would be record speed for this body by today's standard. During his time on the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Rehnquist has defended the original text of the Constitution. To a number of people that may seem like a simple task. After all, it is the Constitution. It is the basic law of the land. What is there to defend? The law speaks for itself. It is a set of plain words on a clear document that has such a significant historical place in our hearts and minds. Yet he comes along on a Court at a point in time when a number of people are saying: It is a living document, it can move with the culture, and we can interpret the words more broadly. We can interpret it not by what it says, but by what we would like it to say. Chief Justice Rehnquist fought against that and fought for the original text of the Constitution and said it is as it is. This is a textural document. If we want to change it, that is fine, but it is changed by two-thirds of the House and two-thirds of the Senate and three-fourths of the States, not by five people on the Court. Those are not his words, but they are the principles he stood for. The role of a Justice on the Supreme Court is to look at the plain meaning and the original text of the Constitution, not at your own cultural bias of the moment and what you believe America may need and therefore may be willing to move to. The problem with a living document is that you don't have the rule of law. You are more of a rule of man. So he defended this proposition of the original text of the Constitution, the intent of the Framers. Certainly, he was a promoter of life. It was in the 1973 dissent in Roe v. Wade that then-Associate Justice Rehnquist wrote, ``To reach its result, the Court necessarily has had to find within the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment a right that was apparently completely unknown to the drafters of the Amendment.'' These are the Associate Justice Rehnquist's words. In his early years of lonely dissents in cases like Roe, Rehnquist made his mark by standing for constitutional principle over the political preferences of an unelected judiciary. With the retirement of Chief Justice Warren Burger in 1986, President Reagan then elevated Associate Justice Rehnquist to the Court's top post, where he served with distinction until his death. The last 19 years have shown that Chief Justice Rehnquist was a terrific choice to lead the Supreme Court. He authored countless landmark decisions and thought-provoking dissents. In carefully reasoned opinions, he insisted that the principle of federalism is an integral part of our nation's constitutional structure. He recognized that our Government is one of enumerated rights and dual sovereignty, with certain functions and powers properly left to the States. One example of Chief Justice Rehnquist's commitment to the laws is his opinion in Dickerson v. United States. Although a long-time critic of Miranda v. Arizona, Rehnquist nevertheless placed his past position aside and wrote the opinion in Dickerson, effectively affirming the holding of Miranda. He served well. He served nobly, and he served with courage. I might note that even during his recent sickness, he found the strength to do his duty and to serve in office. He found the strength to administer the oath of office to President Bush, to consider the challenging cases that came before the Court. Peggy Noonan wrote of President Bush's inauguration, ``the most poignant moment was the manful William Rehnquist, unable to wear a tie and making his way down the long marble steps to swear in the president. The continuation of democracy is made possible by such gallantry.'' While some of his colleagues on the Court disagreed with him at times, there will there can be no doubt that they admired his strong leadership, his likable personality, and his ability to build consensus. That is the noteworthy quality of a gentleman. He served with distinction. He served us well. He carried his course out, and he is now at rest. I yield the floor.","word.count":1350,"sep11":4.09269662921348,"years":2005.95224719101,"days":3899,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.115829381992284,"Topic 2":0.0555719412441479,"Topic 3":0.00595931528513742,"Topic 4":0.0222804142783486,"Topic 5":0.00228098505531421,"Topic 6":0.44752637694676,"Topic 7":0.00365804762116352,"Topic 8":0.0143537029345193,"Topic 9":0.330876441191449,"Topic 10":0.00166339345087635},{"id":"10720010010999","body":"Ciro Rodriguez: Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill to repeal the sunset of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 with respect to the expansion of the adoption credit and adoption assistance programs.","word.count":258,"sep11":-0.235955056179775,"years":2001.62359550562,"days":2358,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.884055520256449,"Topic 2":0.0214432985202236,"Topic 3":0.00379163915654105,"Topic 4":0.0114934611135901,"Topic 5":0.00476044657511514,"Topic 6":0.00304990120498069,"Topic 7":0.0028908285329211,"Topic 8":0.0131639187947322,"Topic 9":0.00826844684401376,"Topic 10":0.0470825390014331},{"id":"10820030002026","body":"David Obey: The gentleman from Massachusetts is making a lot of sense here, but the situation is made that much worse by the fact we are not just trying to hand-pick the next leader from Washington, but the Bush administration has three different favorites, one from the Defense Department, one from the State Department, one from the CIA.","word.count":606,"sep11":1.46067415730337,"years":2003.3202247191,"days":2962,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.113074064677964,"Topic 2":0.179815522758818,"Topic 3":0.00463441828089932,"Topic 4":0.4074281603894,"Topic 5":0.0043305538629322,"Topic 6":0.00266919379868966,"Topic 7":0.0206493727510303,"Topic 8":0.00714371505288083,"Topic 9":0.249809765620242,"Topic 10":0.0104452328071438},{"id":"10619990072856","body":"Pete Domenici: That sounds like an excellent suggestion to me, Mr President. If I could respond, of course, the Senator is correct when he noted that we have, I believe, 7 hours of time that will be consumed, if it is all used, to discuss the continuing resolution. And, of course, we would have a vote at the end of that time. Obviously, Senator Reid and others have made their points on the immigration issue. The H-1B issue, hopefully, we could come to agreement to have a vote scheduled on that. And I would like to work with the minority in determining what time they would find agreeable to have that vote. Perhaps we could do that tomorrow. I am fixing to ask consent that we consider the D.C. appropriations bill, which would give us a time agreement on that, if we could get that. On the appropriations bills, it is like all appropriations conferences. They are never closed until they are closed. There are one or two issues that are very important that are still pending on a number of them. Interior appropriations, I believe, is very close to closure. There is still discussion going on with regard to so-called lands legacy funding and the CARA conservation bill. The Agriculture appropriations bill is very close to conclusion. Once again, we have a couple of issues that have to be dealt with in finality. One of them is how do you deal with the sanctions question. A lot of people are making suggestions and, hopefully, a compromise can be reached that satisfies the great majority of the Senate and the House, Republicans and Democrats. We think we are very close on the HUD-VA appropriations bill. The information I get is the administration is signaling that they think that could be an acceptable bill. There might be some issues that would be considered being added to that, not necessarily appropriations bills. The Transportation appropriations bill, I believe, is for the most part done, with one remaining issue that is very difficult to resolve. But I know the Senator from New Jersey has a very passionate feeling about that. I understand that. So there are at least four or five appropriations bills that are pretty close to being wrapped up in terms of the dollar amounts. There is about one policy issue left on each one of them. We hope to have two or three of those done, perhaps in the House of Representatives tomorrow, and then as quickly as we could get to them after that, we would want to do that. I might say, I am expecting that we will be in session obviously on Monday. We do have the Jewish holiday to honor on Friday, September 29. But we will expect to be here on Monday, October 2, and could be having votes on these conferences that Monday. I want to give Senators as much notice as we can, although we have indicated for quite some time that that first week in the new fiscal year, obviously we will have to be prepared to be in session the whole week and into the night, if necessary. Those are the issues we now have identified. There are a number of other issues that are being worked on. The Finance Committee has been doing some work on the railroad retirement bill and on the community renewal legislation, two issues in which I know there is a lot of interest on both sides of the Capitol. I will give the Senator that list, and, hopefully, we can begin to work together to move a number of these. I believe I sense that opportunity now, when maybe it hadn't been quite ready for that earlier.","word.count":281,"sep11":-2.19943820224719,"years":1999.66011235955,"days":1659,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.376850235593362,"Topic 2":0.0965311535051643,"Topic 3":0.0488625367605749,"Topic 4":0.037826860290839,"Topic 5":0.00572939551533782,"Topic 6":0.00751855320155514,"Topic 7":0.0866777688212774,"Topic 8":0.0154731862006362,"Topic 9":0.320677632115105,"Topic 10":0.00385267799614816},{"id":"10419950113770","body":"Bob Dole: Mr. President, in June 1950 the Communist North Korean Army invaded the Republic of Korea in an all-out effort to extinguish the light of freedom. Although America was weary of war, we came to Korea's defense and joined with many other nations to repel this unprovoked assault. From the start of the war until the Korean armistice was signed in July 1953, almost 1\\1/2\\ million Americans stood shoulder to shoulder in the fight for freedom. Inchon, the Chosin Reservoir, Old Baldy, Pork Chop Hill--all were the locations of famous battles, and all bore witness to American courage and sacrifice in the face of unspeakable hardship. And at the war's end, over 54,000 Americans had made the ultimate sacrifice. More than 100,000 were wounded. And over 8,000 were missing in action. One of those who made the ultimate sacrifice was Ens. Jesse Brown, America's first black naval aviator. And his story bears repeating. In December 1950, Ensign Brown was a member of Fighting Squadron 32, aboard an aircraft carrier somewhere off Korea. He flew 20 close air- support missions, providing cover for our outnumbered marines at the Chosin Reservoir. The battle was fierce; our men on the ground were in a desperate situation. On December 4, 1950, Ensign Brown's aircraft was hit while making a strafing run against the enemy. With tremendous skill, he managed to crash land on a rough, boulder-strewn slope. He survived the crash, waving to his friends as they circled overhead. They knew he was in trouble, however, when he remained in the cockpit when smoke began to billow from the wreckage. Finally, a fellow member of the squadron could stand it no longer. As the others attacked and held off advancing enemy troops, Lt. Thomas Hudner ignored the dangers of the mountain terrain and enemy troops, and made a deliberate wheels- up landing. He ran to Ensign Brown's plane, now erupting in flames, and found his friend alive, badly injured, and trapped in the cockpit. Lieutenant Hudner shoveled snow with his hands to keep Jesse from the flames, burning his own hand badly in the process. Finally, a Marine helicopter arrived. Lieutenant Hudner, joined by a crewman from the helicopter, struggled desperately to get Jesse out. Unfortunately, Ens. Jesse Brown died on that slope in Korea. As President Eisenhower said, Jesse Brown and all those who fought in Korea proved ``once again that only courage and sacrifice can keep freedom alive upon the Earth.'' Unfortunately, as time passed by, the courage of our soldiers and the rightness of our cause seemed to be forgotten, as the Korean war was buried in the back pages of our history books. This week, however, with the dedication of the Korean War Memorial here in Washington, DC--in fact, at about 3 o'clock today--Americans join together to pay a long-overdue tribute to the men and women who sacrificed in this so-called forgotten war. As inscribed at the site, the Korean War Memorial honors the ``sons and daughters who answered the call to defend a country they never knew and a people they never met.'' The haunting images of 2,400 soldiers and the rugged figures of a combat patrol remind us of the Americans and of their allies from 21 other nations who responded when freedom was threatened.

I am glad that I got here in a timely fashion. I join with my colleagues in supporting House Resolution 911 expressing our deep sympathy to the people of India in the aftermath of last week's horrific terrorist attacks in Mumbai and strongly condemning these reprehensible and cowardly acts. I want to commend my colleagues, Representatives Joe Crowley and Joe Wilson, for sponsoring this resolution. On July 11, during the height of the evening rush hour, a series of coordinated explosions shook the heavily traveled commuter rail lines in Mumbai. I am sure that has already been discussed. 207 people were severely injured and killed. Hundreds more were injured less severely. It is my understanding that this represents the deadliest terrorist bombing since the attacks of September 11 of 2001. Mr. Speaker, in recent years relations between United States and India have improved dramatically. There was a period of time during the Cold War when we did not have good relations, but now the world's oldest democracy and the world's largest democracy are forging a partnership and friendship that I think will redound to the benefit of not only the peoples of India and the peoples of the United States, but, indeed, the peoples of the international community. In the immediate aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks, India pledged its full cooperation and offered the use of all its military bases for counterterrorism efforts. That was their offer to us. Mr. Speaker, we mourn the loss suffered by our friends in India and offer our prayers to those who have lost loved ones and those injured in those heinous attacks. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues. Quite obviously this will be a bipartisan effort on behalf of us all. Too few times we act in a bipartisan fashion, but certainly the respect that we have for our democratic friends in India, the respect we have for their history of bringing together almost 1 billion people and soon over 1 billion people together in a democracy and forging a free and open society is one that we can all respect and admire and certainly support. When friends like those sustain great injury, we share with them a sadness and empathy, and we wish them the best, and we let them know that we will be there for them as they have been there for us. I thank Mr. Leach for yielding his time.","word.count":411,"sep11":4.97752808988764,"years":2006.83707865169,"days":4214,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0677145643860253,"Topic 2":0.337820760275368,"Topic 3":0.291040441038477,"Topic 4":0.0256330798106054,"Topic 5":0.0296968789472053,"Topic 6":0.00587510454895451,"Topic 7":0.0027459135417369,"Topic 8":0.0241947750025849,"Topic 9":0.00595202431706552,"Topic 10":0.209326458131976},{"id":"10920060027260","body":"John Dingell: I thank the gentleman for yielding me time I love the people who are pushing this bill, but it is a bad bill. It is triumph of emotion over common sense. We have before us a solution, a poor one, to a nonexistent problem. We have many things that need to be addressed in this Congress, but here we are putting on the floor a piece of legislation poorly thought out, without having had proper hearings or proceedings, over the opposition of a committee, when we have many other things that need doing; health care for Americans, minimum wage, a budget deficit of terrifying proportions, and the appropriations bills and the budget have not yet been completed. While the Nation is at war, working families struggle to make ends meet, and government runs record deficits the leadership has put this curious piece of legislation on the floor. The bill would eliminate humane slaughter of horses. If there is a complaint about how the horses are being slaughtered or transported, there is a way for this body to address that, and I am sure in good will this body would in the exercise of its oversight powers do exactly that. The bill does not count for the high cost of caring for these unwanted animals, nor does it consider the impact that this legislation is going to have on the environment. You know, we have a curious situation where we are going to have to wind up cremating every horse that dies in the country, or we are going to have to incinerate them. I have no idea how we are going to dispose of a huge number of 1,500 to 2,000 pounds of horse each time one of these events happens. Now, basic care costs $1,800. There is no requirement here that a person sell or slaughter his horse. The owner of the horse can do what he wants with it. That makes eminent good sense to me. But I don't think anyone has thought out the consequences of this legislation, what is going to happen with regard to the massive number of horses that are going to have to be incinerated or cremated and the consequences of that with regard to the environment. This is a bad piece of legislation.

When this program was put in place a year ago, it was originally thought to be a program that would replace old-fashioned foreign aid, but because the votes were not there, instead of a transition from one form of foreign aid to another, it was just added on. That is the way we do things here. We keep adding on in order to satisfy everybody. So the foreign aid bill now is up to nearly $20 billion, and that represents $1.25 billion for the Millennium Challenge Account, and it is a $266 million increase from 1 year ago. So we are making ``progress'', if one is a strong supporter of such programs. The strongest argument of those who endorse foreign aid is a humanitarian argument: We are rich, they are poor, we have empathy, we must help, it is our moral obligation. For the most part, people go along with that. But I have a humanitarian argument, also. Mine is that it does not work and that, if we indeed care about people, we ought to be encouraging free markets and individual liberty, and that is when countries become more prosperous. But the idea that we can promote humanitarian programs by taking literally money from poor people in this country and giving it to rich, influential leaders in other countries and we are going to have this miraculous success I think is a myth. It does not work that way, and there are people who are not benefitted. Now, it may be said by those who have promoted the Millennium Challenge Account, that is exactly what we are trying to address. We want to reward countries that are moving in the direction of free markets. Now, that is a nice notion, but it cannot work. It is impossible because when we give money to a government, it is politicized. It becomes bureaucratic, and it has to be handed out to special interests. When Paul Applegarth, the chairman of the corporation for the Millennium Challenge Account was before our committee, I asked him a question. I said, are there any American companies that will benefit by this type of program? I actually was pretty shocked with his answer, because he was very blunt. He said, I certainly hope so. In other words, even our American corporations benefit from programs like this. So it would be nice to think that the poor people of these other countries are going to benefit, but I think it is a greater injury to the poor people of this country. My colleagues say the poor people of this country do not pay taxes. Well, that is incorrect, because the inflation tax is borne by the poor and the middle class, and that occurs when we spend too much money. And this is too much money spent the wrong way, and we do not have the authority to do it. Besides, how many of us ever get calls from our constituents saying please vote for more foreign aid? No, they are asking for more help here, and this distracts from it. When we do not have the money, we run up the debt. Then we go and we literally print the money to pay the bills. We create the inflation and the higher cost of living, and it injures the low and middle income people the most, and they are the ones who are losing jobs. So this is literally money coming out of our pockets for programs that could help us in this country. My suggestion is, since I am a moderate here in the Congress, my moderate approach would be when we have a program like this, whether it is 1.25 or the whole $20 billion, my suggestion is cut it, cut the whole thing. Let us say we cut the $20 billion of foreign aid. I would take $10 billion and put it toward the deficit, and I would join my colleagues on the left and say, look, let us fund some of these programs that are needed or are coming up short. Why are we cutting veterans benefits at the same time? Why do we cut the Corps of Engineers? Why do we not fully fund our infrastructure? This type of spending does not make any economic sense, and it does not make any moral sense.

Kuhl Jr.: Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of National Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Automated External Defibrillator Awareness Week, quite a handle. It commenced just 2 days ago on Sunday and lasts until Saturday. Last year, I introduced legislation to support designating this first week of June as National CPR and AED Awareness Week, and I am pleased that Congress passed my proposal to help bring an important issue to light. Heart disease continues to be--and I repeat that--heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in the United States. So I believe that we must do all we can to bolster our efforts to combat heart disease and sudden cardiac arrest. Approximately 325,000 coronary heart disease deaths occur outside of the hospital emergency room every year, and roughly 95 percent of sudden cardiac arrest victims die before even reaching the hospital. These statistics serve as a clear reminder that we must take action to save lives at the local and the community levels, and an annual National CPR and AED Awareness Week will help us do just that. CPR more than doubles a victim's chances of surviving sudden cardiac arrest by maintaining the vital flow of blood to the heart and to the brain. Over 75 percent of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests occur within the home, so CPR can make a difference between life and death. Additionally, automated external defibrillators are easy for even bystanders to operate and are highly effective in restoring a normal heart rhythm if used within minutes after the sudden onset of cardiac arrest. Communities with comprehensive AED programs have achieved survival rates of over 40 percent, as opposed to 5 percent, which is the traditional rate of survival. And I am proud to have sponsored the New York State law that required public high schools to have at least one such device on the school grounds. As a state senator, I worked with my colleague, Assemblyman Harvey Weisenberg, Long Island, who advanced this initiative after a young man named Louis Acompora from Northport, Long Island, died from a blunt impact to the chest while playing lacrosse. He was a goalie and was doing exactly what he was trained to do. Had an AED been available at the time, his life very well might have been saved. Thankfully, our efforts in New York have helped to save over 35 lives in New York State in the 5 years since the law's enactment. The American Heart Association, the American Red Cross, and the National Safety Council are holding public awareness and training campaigns around the country. And the National Safety Council is also offering a free online course of CPR and AED training all week long. This week, as a result of their efforts, it is our hope to train over 100,000 Americans in CPR and AED treatment opportunities. And Americans will have the opportunity to learn to combat heart disease at the community level and hopefully save lives all across the country. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this week, Mr. Speaker, it's a very important initiative.","word.count":514,"sep11":6.90168539325843,"years":2008.76123595506,"days":4899,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.387060209297518,"Topic 2":0.313841499885872,"Topic 3":0.130200111165856,"Topic 4":0.0213310907975621,"Topic 5":0.0192021548680343,"Topic 6":0.016135705888225,"Topic 7":0.00927282177693141,"Topic 8":0.052509314305407,"Topic 9":0.0418101907444501,"Topic 10":0.0086369012701442},{"id":"10820040048222","body":"Edward Kennedy: Madam President, if I may ask the Senator, we have talked about higher education.

So we are leaving the children behind in higher education. We are leaving them in No Child Left Behind. I would like to ask the Senator from Connecticut as well whether he is not concerned, as I am, about the failure to fund the Head Start Program which reaches out and helps 4-year-olds and 5-year-olds prior to the time they enter kindergarten, to give them skills and help in building confidence so they can gain knowledge and understanding in their early years in school.

I urge my colleagues to resist the temptation to raise Medicare premiums on the people who can least afford it. I have vivid memories of seniors rocking Mr. Rostenkowski's car a few years ago when he decided to raise Medicare premiums. Let's look at it more specifically. The House's fiscal year 2001 budget--this is important--sets $40 billion aside for prescription drugs. In the Senate, we are expected to do a budget that is going to set aside $20 billion now for prescription drugs, and $20 billion later. We don't need either under my plan. We don't need any more money. We don't need $20 billion. We don't need $40 billion. We don't need $2 billion.

Once again we have come back to the Senate floor to press for legislative change on an issue that is critical to health care for all Americans. Time and again we have attempted to stop skyrocketing health care costs due to the runaway tort system under which trial lawyers abuse the court system with spurious claims that drive up insurance premiums for physicians and hospitals and drive them to practice expensive defensive medicine; in other words, performing costly and unnecessary procedures to be sure they won't be sued. Last year I was a cosponsor of S. 11, the Patients First Act of 2003. The Democratic minority precluded us from completing work on that legislation. In February, we targeted a very narrow range of the medical profession to try to see if our colleagues would help us out in one area, the OB/GYN specialty, with S. 2061, called the Healthy Mothers and Healthy Babies Access to Care Act. Again the Democratic minority denied us cloture so we could not consider the bill. It is time to stop this obstructionism. Here we are again. This time I hope my colleagues will join in voting for cloture so we may enact the needed reforms to the medical liability system. This legislation addresses lawsuits for health care liability claims related to the provision of obstetrical, gynecological, emergency, or trauma care. With good reason, we again include the OB/GYN specialty. The dramatic increase in OB/GYN premiums--more than 160 percent over the last 16 years--has greatly outpaced the rate of inflation, and many physicians and hospitals have been unable to keep up with these escalating costs. In my State of Arizona, OB/GYN practices face premiums averaging $67,000, up 16 percent in just 1 year's time. Think of this for a moment. I am not sure what the average salary or wage of an American earner is today, but it is nowhere close to $67,000. That is what your OB/GYN doctor has to pay before he or she can even think about delivering your baby. That is the cost we have driven up. My colleague from Iowa talked about the large number of people who can't afford health insurance. This is one of the reasons they can't afford health insurance. We have so driven up the cost of practicing medicine and the cost of health care by virtue of this broken tort system that a lot of people can't afford insurance and, in fact, employers can't afford to provide insurance for them. Let's do something about it. This legislation does something about it. I would like to share the account of a physician in Paradise Valley, AZ, a woman with whom I spoke about 3 or 4 weeks ago who told me the story of her desire from the time she was a preteen to deliver babies and how she worked hard all through school to get good grades so she could go to medical school and eventually complete her residency. She did that. She had started out as a little girl volunteering in the hospital. She always wanted to deliver babies. After hard work and her degree, she ultimately delivered more than 5,000 babies over the course of 17 years. By the way, the vast majority were without any complications, and she has one of the best reputations as a physician in our community. On one occasion, much to the surprise and dismay of the labor and delivery team, a baby was delivered with complications and cerebral palsy. While a group of doctors conducted a peer review of the case and determined there was no fault on the part of any of the physicians, the doctor who delivered the baby--this woman of whom I speak--3 years after the incident got sued. Initially the plaintiff requested $2 million which was her insurance policy limit. Deciding it was better to settle and avoid long, costly litigation, the insurance company persuaded her to offer to settle the case, which she did. But then the plaintiff asked for $10 million from the physician and another $5 million from the hospital. This highly competent, highly dedicated, and motivated physician found herself consciously practicing medicine differently. For instance, performing a lot more cesarean deliveries in order to lessen the risk of complications to the baby, just in case. She was filled with a new anxiety that had never been present before. Frankly, she said it took a lot of joy out of the work she had enjoyed so much for the previous 17 years. Eventually she stopped delivering babies because of the skyrocketing insurance premiums due to the claim that had been filed against her and, candidly, because of the trepidation she felt now she had been sued and the fact she might be sued again. Incidentally, her case was ultimately settled for less than the policy limits. But here is a physician who was a tremendous contributor to the profession, to our community, to the health of mothers, and the health and viability of a lot of new babies. She is no longer practicing her profession because of the tort system. This physician's story is far too common. It needs to be addressed, and we can address it through the legislation before us. In addition to the reforms for obstetricians and gynecologists, S. 2207 will cover physicians who treat patients in emergency circumstances--not just in the emergency room but in any emergency circumstance--from frivolous lawsuits. Many physicians find themselves distanced from what led them into the profession in the first place-- their desire to help people, just as the physician I talked about. Emergency rooms and trauma centers are flooded with patients who need help from accidents and disasters, all very unfavorable situations. These professionals give their very best to try to address the patient regardless of the circumstance, without even asking whether they have the ability to pay, focused on stabilizing the patients and providing excellent care. Imagine the effect on the physician and the hospital when after treating a patient in an emergency situation, they are faced with a lawsuit, particularly a lawsuit that does not have merit or seeks an excessive award. The result is frequently the emergency rooms are understaffed, sometimes even have to close. The trauma centers are losing specialists and, in some cases, closing. The physicians are not there to provide this kind of emergency care. Since no one knows exactly whether and where an emergency will take place, this legislation covers emergency services anywhere, not just those that occur in the emergency room. For example, if a family practitioner assists a person in an emergency at a mall where somebody had a heart attack, the doctor would be subject to the protection of this bill. If an internist helps a person in an automobile accident at the side of the highway and assists that individual, that care would also be protected by this legislation. The benefit of this legislation is while it makes specific reference to the OB/GYN doctors, it also addresses any emergency services, not just those performed by emergency room physicians or in a trauma center. As with previous bills, this legislation will hold physicians and insurers accountable for medical expenses in instances when they are clearly wrong. S. 2207 will maximize returns to the patients instead of the trial lawyers by setting percentage caps on contingency fees. These are the fees the lawyers receive. The bill would allow lawyers to be well compensated for their work but not at the unfair expense of the plaintiffs. Patients would have 3 years from the date of injury to bring forth a claim. In the case of minors, that statute of limitations would be extended. The bill will allow for unlimited awards of economic damages but place reasonable caps on the so-called noneconomic damages or pain and suffering damages. If we can pass S. 2207, we should therefore see tremendous benefits: a reduction in the backlog of these cases in our courts; a reduction and perhaps elimination of these excessive jury awards; a reduction in the amount of money paid by the insurance companies to settle the cases. They incur great expenses in defending the cases in court and even processing the claims for settlement. Even those that are dismissed cost money. Physicians spend a large amount of money to defend themselves even in those cases they win. A large number of these cases are settled out of court to prevent the so-called mega award, the big award that can bankrupt a practice. But something else will happen if we pass this bill. As I said, my colleague from Iowa complained about too many people not having insurance and one of the reasons why is because it has been expensed beyond their ability to pay or their employer's ability to pay. Why? Because the insurance company has to take into account these malpractice awards, even the possibility a physician will be sued. Imagine this: When a physician has to pay $67,000 in premiums for the ability to deliver babies, think about how that additional cost has to be shifted to the beneficiaries, the patients, the people who receive the care, because the insurance companies have to make sure whatever happens, their costs are covered. So if we are going to talk about making it easier for people to get insurance, making it easier for physicians to be able to continue their practices, for hospital emergency rooms to continue to stay open, and all of the other kinds of care to be provided, even that situation where you have a wreck on the side of the road and a doctor stops and renders emergency care to you--any one of those situations--then we need to deal with this bill tomorrow. This has been around far too long, and tomorrow is our opportunity to right this wrong, vote for cloture, and enable us to take a final vote on the bill.

This bill provides authorization for the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the newly consolidated Institute for Museum and Library Services, and the Arts and Artifacts Indemnity Act, through the year 2000. Mr. President, this has been a controversial bill I know, and we have done our utmost in the committee, and will continue to do so through the markup, to restore the kind of confidence that this act in these various endowments deserve. The subject of government sponsorship of the arts and humanities evokes great disagreement and spirited debate from thoughtful people. My colleagues here in the Senate are certainly no strangers to the controversies and discussions associated with the National Endowment for the Arts. I must say that throughout the process of drafting the bill this consideration has been on my mind. I worked in consultation with my Republican and Democratic colleagues on the Labor Committee in hopes of addressing concerns and incorporating constructive suggestions as to how to improve each of the agencies. At each subcommittee hearing, we had opportunities to discuss fundamental issues related to the NEA, NEH, and IMS with a host of individuals each with very different perspectives. Some spoke of the merits of the Endowments, others proposed significant change, still others advocated total elimination of the Endowments as we now know them. We had the opportunity to see the work of the IMS first hand. The hearing on the Institute for Museum Services was held at the Alexandria Black History Resource Center--a center that serves the community, is home to a wonderful collection of photographs and objects, supports education and lifelong learning initiatives, and is there for the enjoyment of all of the people of Alexandria, and others who visit. The exchanges at each of the hearings were enlightening, lively, and I believe in the end, very productive. We were able to discuss ideas and concepts which challenged the way we have thought of these agencies. I believe we successfully broadened this discussion from that of simply all or nothing--elimination versus no change--and created an opportunity to improve upon these agencies. We have sought to do something very different with this bill. We have made changes that will lead to substantial improvement in terms of how these agencies work and made it even more clear in the legislation as to the priority of who they serve. I learned a great deal from the hearings and feel certain that we have incorporated some of the valuable and thoughtful ideas that were shared during these discussions. There was room for improvement at the NEA and NEH. In addition, there is a clear and direct connection to learning between the IMS and libraries. We have worked very hard on this bill, for very simple reasons, in my opinion. The National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, libraries and museums make enormous contributions to vibrancy and greatness of our society. They enrich the fabric of this Nation, they bring us together, enable us to better express ourselves and better understand each other and many times, through the arts and humanities we reach those who have been written off. Simply, the arts and humanities are an integral improvement in terms of how these agencies work and make even more clear that legislation is needed as to the priority of those who they serve. I learned a great deal from the hearings and feel certain that we will have incorporated some of the most valuable and thoughtful ideas that were shared during these discussions. There was room for improvement in the NEA and the NEH. In addition, it is clear that direct connection to learning between the NEH, the NEA, and the libraries is enlightening. We have worked very hard on this bill for very simple reasons, in my opinion. The National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities and the institute for Museum and Library Services make enormous contributions. Encouraging curiosity, thought, learning, dialog, and understanding are endeavors that the Federal Government should have a role in supporting. In fact, I believe the Federal Government should have a leadership role in fostering and preserving the unique cultural heritage of the Nation. And to give credit where credit is due, the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Institute for Museum Services and libraries have made the arts and humanities more accessible to all people of our Nation and have created innovative and exciting ways of learning to the lives of many, old and young. My support of these agencies is based on what I have witnessed and learned over the years--facts about what they really do and who they really serve. I have seen the many ways the Endowments' and the IMS' programs have touched people's lives. Their programs have reached children who, prior to their involvement with the arts or humanities had little interest in learning and less hope. Each of these agencies have enabled individuals to gain a better understanding of their neighbors and their communities through participation in community festivals and other outreach activities. They have brought the beauty and the magic of the Nation's rich culture to even the smallest corners of the Nation. My own State of Vermont, while unique in so many ways, is part of a common phenomenon--when the arts, humanities, museums, and libraries are introduced to a community--that community comes alive, its people come alive. There are examples of excellence in the arts and humanities in Vermont which deserve mention. Book Discussion for General Audiences, which began from a small grant from the Vermont Council for the Humanities at the suggestion of a local librarian in my home town of Rutland, VT, has become a integral component of the agenda in many of the State humanities councils. The Shelburne Museum has received grants from the NEA, NEH, and IMS. It is a showcase and a leading institution of American folk art and decorative arts and artifacts-- visited by Vermonters and other visitors from across the country and around the world. It has worked in partnership with local libraries, local schools, and with adult education projects. These are but two examples of thousands which have enhanced the experiences of people in a State. It has been my intention to preserve what the agencies do well, yet provide them with greater guidance and direction as to the purpose of their work.

I tell my colleagues that the language I offered 2 years ago had a rape and incest exception and life of the mother. The unanimous-consent agreement does not allow that at this time. That is the reason I said we may well have to have another amendment, because that is my intention. That is my belief. I happen to think that is where the votes are in this body. I do not know where the votes are exactly on this language right now on adopting the House language. The House language is exactly the policy we had from 1984 to 1993, exactly the same, and that is what they adopted in the House. They adopted it with a 50-vote margin. I stated to my friends on both sides of this issue that I thought where the votes were was to ensure that no funds could be used for abortion by Federal employees from their health insurance unless it is necessary to save the life of the mother or in cases of rape and incest. I have endeavored to try to introduce this amendment. I have been denied that opportunity. The way the unanimous consent is drafted, I am not able to do it at this point. That is the reason I said, well, if this amendment is not agreed to, we may have to do that later. This amendment would keep the House language and it is amendable.

I know my friend from Maryland--I have great respect for my friend from Maryland because we have worked on a lot of things over the years, and we have always done it very civilly--I know she has a different opinion, and I respect that. She has a right to offer an amendment. There is no time agreement, there is no limitation on amendments, and so if people have different ideas, they are certainly welcome to offer those. I just wanted my friend from North Dakota to know, I wanted my friend from Maine, Senator Snowe, to know--and I mentioned that to them; they were the only two people who mentioned rape and incest in the debate--I just wanted them to know it is my intention to try to accommodate that language.

I also want to acknowledge the support and cooperation of our chairman of the full committee the gentleman from Alaska and seeing to it that we move this bill expeditiously through subcommittee, full committee and to the floor today. There is no question this bill is a long time in coming, and it should, when enacted and implemented, bring to fruition the long- planned and sort of haltingly carried out efforts to clean up decades- long contamination of this repository of one-fifth of all the fresh water on the face of the Earth, the Great Lakes. It has been my home all my life, living not on the shore but close enough to the shore of Lake Superior, my hometown of Chisholm just about 90 miles away. I spent a great deal of my time as a young lad near the shores of Lake Superior and my service in the Congress, my District extends from Duluth all the way up to Canada, along that splendid rocky outcrop of the 3 billion year old deposits of basalt that look broodingly out onto Lake Superior, which represents 10 percent of the fresh water on the face of the Earth. My predecessor Congressman John Blatnik was the original author of the first Clean Water Act, Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1956 that began the Nation's efforts to clean up the waters of the United States and was the one who inspired the research laboratories that now are located throughout the Great Lakes to serve as a beacon for the protection, beacon out on those fresh waters to serve as the protection for the future generations of the Great Lakes, on the purity and quality of those waters. In years past, when I chaired the Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight, I held extensive hearings on the United States-Canada Clean Water Agreement to push administrations in the past to action on cleanup of the toxic hot spots, or areas of concern as they are called. It is just an unspeakable tragedy that nearly 100 percent of the near shore waters of the Great Lakes and connecting tributaries are under fish consumption advisories because those fish have taken up toxics from bottom feeding organisms, from plants, carried them in their bodies and then are consumed by humans. It was presented in documented testimony in the hearings that I held in the Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight and corroborated since then in subsequent hearings. The chairman has conducted a few. If a person lives within 20 miles of the Great Lakes and they eat fish once a week, they have on average 440 parts per billion PCBs in their body. If they live anywhere else in America and eat fish once a week, they probably have only 5 parts per billion per PCBs in their body. I need not go into the adverse health consequences of PCBs. They are well-documented in the medical and scientific literature. We had a researcher, Dr. Waylon Swain, from the University of Michigan testify at the Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight hearing who had done tests on his 16-year-old daughter of the fatty tissue in her body and the content of PCBs and then did a computer projection to determine how long it would take for future generations, for PCBs to leave her offspring if none of them were exposed in the future to PCBs. Six generations. This is a persistent toxic chemical that we need to extract from the bottoms of those areas of concern. Of the 43 areas of concern of the Great Lakes, 31 are wholly or partly within U.S. waters, and they are mostly harbors. More than 1.3 million in cubic yards of contaminated sediments have been remediated over the past 3 years. We have just touched the top of the challenge, and remediation is nowhere near completed in any one of the areas of concern. The people of the Great Lakes community, 36 million of them, have lived with this problem that threatens their physical health, the health of their children, and impacts the entire region, both economically and in degradation of the Great Lakes environment. I was heartened when former President Clinton in fiscal 2000 included within the administration's budget a request for $50 million for remediation of contaminated sediments, and I had at the time introduced H.R. 3670 to authorize a program for cleanup of the Great Lakes areas of concern, but neither the bill nor the $50 million came to fruition. But the initiatives then stimulated further attention. I am very delighted to acknowledge the work of the gentleman from Michigan , who is a colleague of ours on the Committee of Transportation and Infrastructure, whose scientific mind and appreciation of the challenges has brought considerable expertise and passion for cleaning up these waters to this issue, and I compliment the gentleman for introducing the bill today before us which will authorize $50 million annually for the Environmental Protection Agency to carry out projects to address sediment contamination in the Great Lakes areas of concern. These are going to be prioritized projects. Priority will be given to those that actively address the contaminated sediments that have been identified in the remedial action plans for the areas of concern, projects that promise to implement innovative approaches, new technologies and new techniques to deal with contaminated sediment so as not to, as Chairman Duncan expressed concern, reintroduce contaminants into the water column and thereby reestablish the pollution or distribute it further. One of these innovative approaches is one that has been undertaken by the U.S. environmental research laboratory of EPA in Duluth, the University of Minnesota's Natural Resources Research Institute and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the harbor of Duluth, using mining technologies which we in the iron ore mining country of my district use to beneficiate low-grade, nonmagnetic ores using a process that has a cost in the range of $2 to $3 a cubic yard versus $400 to $600 a cubic yard for other technologies, have successfully remediated large volumes of toxic-substance-containing sediment so that this cleansed sediment now can be used in parks and reclaiming areas along the waterfront in Duluth for other environmentally friendly activities. These are the kinds of innovative approaches this legislation will support and stimulate in the future. The legislation before us also has clarifying language to ensure that the new program will have no effect on existing Federal and State authorities to address contaminated sites. The IJC report recently found that all sediment remediation completed to date has been funded as a result of enforcement action, or the threat of enforcement action, against polluters. While that still would remain, we would hope ideally that there would be a cooperative approach to cleanup. The aptly named ``orphan sites'' will be one of the targets of this legislation. I expect EPA and the States to continue to pursue and to hold accountable polluters responsible for contamination of all the areas of concern. Mr. Speaker, again I want to thank the gentleman from Michigan for his persistence in pursuing this issue, the gentleman from Tennessee for his diligence in bringing the legislation forward, the gentleman from Alaska for his participation, and the gentleman from Oregon for his active support on our side as the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.","word.count":280,"sep11":0,"years":2001.8595505618,"days":2442,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.881238600394187,"Topic 2":0.0400733293017854,"Topic 3":0.00816440627308832,"Topic 4":0.0178270253801901,"Topic 5":0.00783295904573735,"Topic 6":0.0117449996125738,"Topic 7":0.00633657974904106,"Topic 8":0.0141658085128358,"Topic 9":0.00926435685321777,"Topic 10":0.00335193487734395},{"id":"10920050075067","body":"Ron Wyden: Mr. President, America can do better than making a policeman walking the beat pay a higher Federal tax rate than someone who makes their money on capital gains and dividends. Unfortunately, the Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform today sent to the President a recommendation that will widen the gap between our middle class workers and the fortunate few. I am a Democrat who believes in markets, I believe in wealth creation, I believe in entrepreneurship, but I also believe in what Henry Ford said. He, of course, was the great industrialist. He made it clear that he wanted to make money and he wanted to do well but he said: For me to make money, my workers have to have enough money to be able to buy my cars. What concerns me tonight is that the middle class, the folks who are hurting, have gotten short shrift once again from the special advisory panel on tax reform. These are the folks, the middle class folks, who are walking an economic tightrope, balancing their medical bills against their energy bills, trying to set aside money to save for retirement and health. They are the ones who deserve a break. I heard mention tonight that Democrats, Senators on my side of the aisle, were not interested in cutting taxes. Well, I proposed last week to cut taxes for millions of middle class people and folks with incomes up to $150,000 by eliminating scores of exemptions, deductions and special interest breaks that exist on both the individual side of the code and the corporate side of the code. What we saw today is the special advisory panel on tax reform wanted none of that. They did not want to make those kinds of tough choices that step on the toes of special interests, powerful interests with big lobbies. Instead, what they did is take it once again out of the hide of middle income people who would be asked to give up tax breaks and support for concerns such as child care. When we already have a big gap between those who work for wages and those who make their income on capital gains and dividends, how can it be that it is now proposed to widen that gap? I think we would be well advised to look back to 1986, when the late President Reagan worked in a bipartisan way with Democrats, both with the Senate and the other body, to come up with a proposal that I think--certainly its foundation would be very appealing now. It makes sure that all income is treated equally. That is what this country has always been about. I do not want to soak anybody. I do not want to discriminate against anybody. But I do not think it is right for workers to have to pay a higher effective tax rate than those who make their money on capital gains and dividends. Income ought to be treated the same. That is what the country is all about. It seems to me that the advisory panel on tax reform missed a big opportunity today when they widened the gap between those who work for wages and those who make their income from wealth. If one looks at the tax panel's recommendations, in effect, they throw three strikes at the middle class and they lob softballs to the special interests. The first pitch is a slider that shifts a sizable tax burden away from those at the top to the middle income taxpayers. That is followed by a fast ball that takes away many of the deductions and credits such as those for child care and medical needs that middle income Americans have come to rely on. The third pitch is a change-up. The plan may look revenue neutral, but when it flies across the plate, it adds billions of dollars to the budget deficit and will force middle class Americans and their children to pay for tax cuts for the fortunate few. Under this special advisory panel plan that was proposed today, the middle class simply strikes out. Certainly, those who are at the top are going to enjoy the grand slam that is offered by the panel's plan. The panel would cut their tax rates, those at the very top, once again and there is not the kind of massive housecleaning of the tax system either. I proposed in my legislation, S. 1927, the Fair Flat Tax Act of 2005, that everybody pays their fair share, not just cutting the tax rates for the fortunate, making up for it by having the middle class subsidize those tax breaks, but mine would treat all income equally. To carry out our proposal, we include a new, simplified 1040 form, one page, 30 lines, for every individual taxpayer. There are three brackets rather than the current system. Under my proposal the brackets are 15, 25, and 35, and we create a flat corporate rate of 35 percent. This plan is more fair because it would no longer disproportionately favor the most affluent at the expense of the middle class. Certainly, the tax breaks that my legislation calls for step on toes. I pay for those middle class tax cuts. The proposal has been scored by the experts at the Congressional Research Service. I pay for the middle class tax cut by eliminating scores of tax breaks that are now in the Code for individuals and businesses. Certainly, some of them are going to object, already have. It seems to me that it is worth it to make a radical statement about tax laws, and that is that America can do better than a two-tiered tax system which forces a policeman to pay a higher effective tax rate than an investor who makes his income on capital gains dividends. What is fair about taxing a firefighter's hard-earned wages at a higher percentage than a corporate executive? Under the current Federal Tax Code, all income is not created equal, and under what the panel proposed today to the President of the United States, the equality gap between the middle class and the fortunate few is going to grow. Under the proposal that was sent to the President today, Americans who work for wages would further subsidize the cuts, credits, and deferrals of those who make their money from investments such as capital gains and dividends. Personally, I think there were other opportunities for innovations that the panel missed. For example, I proposed in my legislation to end favoritism for itemizers. We do that by tripling the standard deduction for single filers from $5,000 to $15,000 and raise the deduction from $10,000 to $30,000 for married couples. I eliminate the alternative minimum tax, which could snare as many as 21 million Americans in 2006. But instead of forcing middle-class people to pay for that, I go after some of those breaks and exemptions and special interest favors that have made their way into the Tax Code. I will also say that the panel should have moved to correct a glaring inequity in the current tax system, which is regressive State and local taxes. They were advised about how regressive the State and local taxes have become, but unfortunately they took a pass on dealing with this issue as well. Under current law, low- and middle-income taxpayers get hit with a double whammy. Compared to the fortunate few, they pay more of their income in State and local taxes. Poor families pay more than 11 percent, and middle-income families pay about 10 percent of their income in State and local taxes, while the most affluent pay much less, only about half that. Because many low- and middle-income taxpayers do not itemize, they get no credit on their Federal form for paying State and local taxes. In fact, two-thirds of the Federal deduction for State and local taxes goes to those with incomes above $100,000. Under my legislation, the Fair Flat Tax Act, for the first time the Federal Tax Code would look at an individual's entire tax situation. My legislation would look at an individual's combined Federal, State, and local tax burden and give credit to low- and middle-income individuals to correct for regressive State and local taxes. By contrast, the advisory panel that reported to the President today proposes to eliminate the current State and local tax deduction with no credit or other mechanism to address the total tax burden that is paid by individuals in this country. So once again, the panel's approach further skews the overall tax burden toward low- and middle-income taxpayers, with the fortunate few benefiting and the middle class getting hammered again. The proposal I have made keeps in place the deductions most important for our middle-class citizens and particularly the investments they make--the investments they make in their home, in their retirement, in education--those concerns that are so important to maintaining a middle class in our country. In contrast to the proposal made by the advisory panel today, my legislation means that the vast majority of American taxpayers will see a cut, particularly the middle class in our country. The Congressional Research Service has indicated that all Americans, particularly the middle class and those with incomes up to $150,000, will see tax relief. The President's panel, the advisory panel that reported today, itself said that most taxpayers under its plan will not see much difference in their taxes. We are going to have a battle of ideas. We hear often that there ought to be a debate about specific proposals. Now we have one. The advisory panel that reported to the President of the United States said, by their own analysis, that most taxpayers under their proposal will not see much difference in their taxes. Under the proposal I have made for a fair, flat tax rate, what is going to happen in this country, according to the independent analysts at the Congressional Research Service, is that millions of middle-class people will get a tax cut, and all Americans with incomes up to $150,000 will see tax relief. Where the panel throws strikes at the middle class, I say it is time to give the middle class a break. I certainly question the fairness of the President further cutting tax rates for those who are the most affluent in this country while the gap widens between those who depend on their wages to support their families. Finally, to illustrate the contrast, the proposal made by the panel today does","word.count":2370,"sep11":4.24719101123596,"years":2006.10674157303,"days":3954,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0288104449909576,"Topic 2":0.250703227421627,"Topic 3":0.0171402909010441,"Topic 4":0.0218991661622023,"Topic 5":0.0164721788940173,"Topic 6":0.114699005339631,"Topic 7":0.0130424927473286,"Topic 8":0.241289515352528,"Topic 9":0.251059691048332,"Topic 10":0.0448839871423319},{"id":"11020070041186","body":"Lamar Smith: Without objection, it is so ordered","word.count":453,"sep11":6.04494382022472,"years":2007.90449438202,"days":4594,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.474947955438194,"Topic 2":0.0185373902014894,"Topic 3":0.00859253786607942,"Topic 4":0.00937476483626752,"Topic 5":0.417804009141937,"Topic 6":0.00449244963269276,"Topic 7":0.00200427978076458,"Topic 8":0.0572464678343724,"Topic 9":0.00169376640777786,"Topic 10":0.00530637886042455},{"id":"10419950000079","body":"Porter J.

To reflect on what Mr. Vento said, that we are told in this particular article that 12 States of the United States that are serving 600,000 elderly have told the Department of Health and Human Services that within 2 weeks, 2 weeks, the Meals on Wheels Program will run out, and the transportation programs for seniors will run out. Moreover, they say that the Government has not paid the private companies that process Medicare claims since mid-December, and they are now owing something like $60 million. The administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, HCFA, which really makes the payments to Medicare and Medicaid, is saying that benefits are funded with trust fund money, but administrative officials worry that the processing companies which they depend on will have to begin to lay off workers by the thousands and this is going to delay reimbursement to the hospitals and to the doctors. Can you imagine the chaos that this country is going to go through if that is, in fact, brought about? We talk about the environment. The Environmental Protection Agency yesterday began to shut down its Superfund Program, the very program that is so important to the cleanup of toxic waste in this country. And although the program already has multiyear funding, that funding operates on an administrative spending ceiling that the EPA could crash through if the shutdown continues as it is now doing. The EPA yesterday started issuing stop-work orders to its contractors who employ some 10,000 employees across this country. They are going to be laid off. There are 18,000 employees of EPA now on furlough. What is going to happen to Superfund? There is some real crises, my friends, taking place here unless we reach some solution.","word.count":448,"sep11":-6.85955056179775,"years":1995,"days":0,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0202908241936666,"Topic 2":0.345543648355827,"Topic 3":0.00685397487439442,"Topic 4":0.00498187151077345,"Topic 5":0.0136396808033196,"Topic 6":0.0279985617305922,"Topic 7":0.447486490774175,"Topic 8":0.0363170345675741,"Topic 9":0.0886072690246283,"Topic 10":0.00828064416505014},{"id":"10720020030592","body":"Tim Johnson: Madam President, I rise today to honor an individual for his extraordinary leadership for family farmers and ranchers in South Dakota and across the entire country. Mr. Leland Swenson has been the president of the National Farmers Union for the past fourteen years, and the president of the South Dakota Farmers Union for 7 years prior to that. For the past 20 years, Lee has been the leading voice for family farm agriculture in the country. During his tenure in these positions, Lee has provided immeasurable service, support, and leadership for family farmers and ranchers in efforts to maintain prosperity of rural communities. A native of Minnesota, Lee was recruited to begin his career with South Dakota Farmers Union in 1971 as the Secretary/Treasurer. Lee was a very successful organizer, resulting in an increase in membership for 6 out of his 8 years at this post. Because of his talent, initiative, and ingenuity, Lee joined the National Farmers Union headquarters in Denver, CO as Field Services Coordinator. Lee's dedication to building a membership base and maintaining that base is something to be admired. Returning to South Dakota, Lee was elected the president of SDFU in 1981. During his swearing in ceremony, Mr. Swenson pledged to ``preserve, protect and defend the family farm system of agriculture.'' Lee has fulfilled that promise time and time again. While farm prices were dropping and interest rates were rising in the 1980's, Lee rose to the challenge of preserving the family farm in his role as president. In response to a veto of an emergency credit bill by President Reagan in 1985, Lee organized over 8,000 farmers and ranchers to gather for a ``Farm Alliance Rally'' in Pierre, SD. This was the second largest farm rally ever to be held at the state capital. Two other organizations were involved in gathering attendants, resulting in 25 Jackrabbit Line busses bringing the farmers and ranchers to South Dakota's capital city. The overwhelming number of constituents rallying could not be ignored by the state legislators, therefore the state legislature appropriated funds to send the 105 member body plus the governor to Washington, DC to lobby Congress for the restructuring of farm and ranch debt at serviceable interest rates. This first rally served as a stepping stone for Lee to organize another rural rally 15 years later in Washington. In 2000, bus loads of farmers, ranchers, church leaders, labor organizations, and rural community leaders gathered at the nation's capital to rally for the sustainability of rural America. Without the experience, dedication, or conviction of Lee Swenson this rally would not have been a success. For the last 100 years, the primary goal of National Farmers Union has been to sustain and strengthen family farm and ranch agriculture. The key to this goal has been Farmers Union's grassroots structure in which policy positions are initiated locally. National Farmers Union believes that good opportunities in production agriculture are the foundation of strong farm and ranch families and that strong farm and ranch families are the basis for thriving rural communities. In order for these goals and values to be carried out consistently, a well- respected, talented, and dedicated leader is vital. That is exactly what Lee Swenson provided to the organization. Lee Swenson has achieved a number of other accomplishments during his tenure with the National Farmers Union. Bringing the states of Alaska, California, and Missouri into the organization, organizing the single largest farm rally in Washington, DC and expanding the government relations, communications and education departments of the NFU. As National Farmers Union celebrates their 100th anniversary this year, and Lee steps down from his post as president, the delegation body can look back on prior accomplishments and be nothing but proud. Proud of their organization, proud of their commitment to family farmers and ranchers, and proud of their outgoing leader. Finally, Lee has always been dedicated to family agriculture, and I know he will continue to contribute to not only the state of South Dakota, but family agriculture across the country. Therefore, I wish him all the best and I will continue to rely upon his valuable insight on the sustainability of rural America. On behalf of the people of South Dakota, I want to thank Lee for being a true public servant who has helped improve the quality of life for thousands of rural Americans.","word.count":727,"sep11":0.412921348314607,"years":2002.27247191011,"days":2589,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0701235700626295,"Topic 2":0.0171544970014499,"Topic 3":0.226385293448971,"Topic 4":0.0242974649951201,"Topic 5":0.00586422736154301,"Topic 6":0.00520279062887979,"Topic 7":0.634269560638843,"Topic 8":0.00750513252148393,"Topic 9":0.00737359873695021,"Topic 10":0.00182386460412861},{"id":"10920060020453","body":"Jeff Flake: Mr. Chairman, I would simply say, again, we all say it is our job to represent our constituents, and it certainly is.

Senators Santorum and Gregg similarly, just last week, introduced S. 23, the Healthy Mothers and Healthy Babies Access to Care Act, a bill to limit legal damages in cases involving obstetrical and gynecological services. Today I voted not to invoke cloture on the motions to proceed to these two bills, because there has been no debate of these particular measures in the 109th Congress. There have been no hearings scheduled or held on the bills this year, and their provisions raise questions to which West Virginians deserve complete and well-considered responses. The situation in West Virginia today is not as it was several years ago, when the State legislature enacted medical liability tort reform. At that time, there was a perceived crisis based on the escalating costs of medical insurance premiums, and there were serious concerns that doctors and other health care providers may have been leaving the State to avoid the expenses they incurred in protecting themselves from legal liability. Today, however, even the West Virginia State Medical Association, a strong supporter of medical liability reform, advises that, based on the significant changes passed by the West Virginia State Legislature in 2003, the State has ``already seen positive results with recent decreases in insurance premiums and an increase in the ability to recruit physicians to the state.'' Based on the acknowledged success of West Virginia's legislative enactments in this area, it would be irresponsible, if not downright foolhardy, to enact S. 22 and S. 23 with little examination and no recent debate, particularly when the provisions of these bills would explicitly preempt certain State laws. In addition, the bills shorten the time during which patients can bring cases; they limit punitive damages; they exempt from product liability lawsuits health care providers who have prescribed drugs or devices approved by the FDA; and they generally revamp our Nation's medical liability system in the wink of an eye, though the bills' provisions have been subject to little, if any, serious scrutiny. Based on the changes that have occurred in our medical liability system since 2003, legislation of this importance requires careful consideration by the Senate's relevant committees of jurisdiction. To give such important provisions such short shrift, particularly in this changed environment, would do a tremendous disservice to medical providers and patients throughout both West Virginia and the Nation.","word.count":418,"sep11":4.7752808988764,"years":2006.63483146067,"days":4142,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0163274282559557,"Topic 2":0.322724792690677,"Topic 3":0.00727561376997935,"Topic 4":0.00827266301469404,"Topic 5":0.0257135572421725,"Topic 6":0.00668731949417077,"Topic 7":0.00637495566842812,"Topic 8":0.487322988153693,"Topic 9":0.0785136113814167,"Topic 10":0.0407870703288126},{"id":"10820030069905","body":"Barbara Mikulski: Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep sense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from Kokomo, IN. LCpl James Swain, 20 years old, died on November 15th. When his unit was faced with determining who among them would go to Iraq, James volunteered--a selfless choice that would cost him his life. James was shot while conducting combat operations in the Al Anbar province of Iraq. With his entire life before him, James risked everything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world. After graduating from Kokomo High School in 2002, James followed a long-standing family tradition by joining the Armed Forces. His father Dan told the Kokomo Tribune that James had always enjoyed hearing stories of his days as an Army medic. However, James chose the path of his grandfather, who had also been a marine. According to friends and loved ones, James was born to serve and had touched many lives with his service and his generous spirit. He had dreams of continuing to help his country by becoming a criminal profiler for the CIA or FBI. James was the 39th Hoosier soldier to be killed while serving his country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was assigned to the Headquarters Battalion, 1st Marines, Regimental Combat Team-1, 1st Marine Division, Camp Pendleton, CA. This brave young soldier leaves behind his parents, Dan and Mona Swain; his grandfather, Edward Swain; his brother, Benjamin Swain; and his sisters, Mary Ann and Melissa Swain. Today, I join James' family, his friends, and the entire Hoosier community in mourning his death. While we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer place. It is his courage and strength of character that people will remember when they think of James, a memory that will burn brightly during these continuing days of conflict and grief. James was known for his dedication to serving others and his love of family and country. When looking back on James' life, Charlie Hall, a former coach at Kokomo High School, told the Kokomo Tribune, ``Anything he tried, he did to the fullest. He did well. I think it says a lot about the quality of our service people if there are people like James serving.'' His high school principal Harold Canady remembered him by saying, ``James was an outstanding young man . . . The best way I can describe him is that he is the all-American boy. He chose to serve his country and was willing to make that sacrifice.'' Today and always, James will be remembered by family members, friends and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero and we honor the sacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country. As I search for words to do justice in honoring James' sacrifice, I am reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement is just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain that the impact of James' actions will live on far longer than any record of these words. It is my sad duty to enter the name of James Swain in the official record of the Senate for his service to this country and for his profound commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace. When I think about this just cause in which we are engaged, and the unfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like James' can find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces.'' May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be with all of you, as I know He is with James.","word.count":548,"sep11":1.87359550561798,"years":2003.73314606742,"days":3109,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0523107442640755,"Topic 2":0.469604572399165,"Topic 3":0.176411782586185,"Topic 4":0.0767599764706914,"Topic 5":0.0521040002959989,"Topic 6":0.0132350202770594,"Topic 7":0.0106847371323088,"Topic 8":0.112808434765305,"Topic 9":0.0147740508622141,"Topic 10":0.0213066809469968},{"id":"10920050020178","body":"Edward Royce: Mr. Chairman, a methamphetamine epidemic is plaguing America, as we know.

I am very pleased that the Homeland Security Committee had the opportunity to mark up this legislation and that we included several provisions that will strengthen the Coast Guard's maritime security activities. This bill increases the Coast Guard's end strength by 1,500 members to ensure that there are adequate personnel to carry out all of the Coast Guard's missions. This addresses my long-standing concerns about inadequate staffing at the Coast Guard. The legislation also requires the use of security zones around all liquefied natural gas, or LNG, facilities. This is a critical step in stopping these facilities from becoming targets as the number of LNG imports increases. This bill will also improve the lot of the Transportation Worker Identification Credential, or the TWIC, by providing more facilities where workers can submit their fingerprints so they can enroll in TWIC more efficiently and meet the September 25, 2008, deadline. This affects 650,000 port workers. In addition, the legislation enhances oversight of TWIC by requiring reports to Congress and the GAO on ongoing program implementation. H.R. 2830 requires the establishment of an additional maritime security response team. Currently there is only one in the Nation, and it is based on the east coast. It makes sense to have a second one, because, of course, there are plenty of people on the west coast, and we need it. I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation and its many provisions.

I add my voice in support of this bill. I want to thank, particularly, the chairman of the committee, Senator Chafee, the ranking member, Senator Baucus, and Senators Kempthorne, Reid, and the other members of the committee, who worked so hard. And I can say, on behalf of myself and my wonderful staff, Linda Delgado, that working with the staffs of the chairman and the ranking member has just been a joy to us. Of course, I have some very special feelings about passage of this bill today, because an amendment that I worked very hard to get through this U.S. Senate, the consumer right to know amendment, has been adopted by the conference. The Senator from Wyoming didn't think it was a particularly good amendment, but I have to say that when one looks at what we are facing--I pick up this glass of water to drink what may be Washington, DC, water--and I think it is important that those of us who drink this water, or tap water from anywhere in this country, know what contaminants are in our drinking water. I am very proud of this particular bill because, first of all, we won on the issue of consumer confidence reports. I disagree with my friend from Wyoming, because he thinks they will confuse people. I think people are smarter than that. I have always believed in giving people information. The way this information is portrayed will be clear and simple, and I think it will be easy to understand. If it is not, it can be revised so that it is even easier. So I am extremely proud that we will require getting consumer confidence reports out to people, so they will know what is in the water they ingest, the water that is their lifeline. It seems to me a very important thing. I have to say that the conference and the House deserve a lot of credit, but we built on the 40 votes we got here in the U.S. Senate. I want to say to all my colleagues who supported the Boxer amendment, my deepest thanks, because had we only gotten a few votes, we may not have gotten the agreement of our chair and our ranking member. Our chair and our ranking member knew there was support for the concept. I think the difficulty arose in the details of the amendment. The other part of this bill that gives me great pride deals with the section on sensitive subpopulations. We attached it to the safe drinking water bill in the last Congress and in this Congress. The language in this bill requires that EPA drinking water standards be set at levels that take into account the special vulnerability of our children, our infants, our pregnant women, our elderly, the chronically ill, and other groups that are at substantially higher risk than the average healthy adult. The truth of the matter is that vulnerable populations are much weaker than a 165-pound man. The way we have set the standard throughout history has been for that very healthy, strong man. A little child, or someone who is ill, or an elderly person may be negatively affected by water that would not hurt a healthy person. Mr. President, this is an important milestone, in my opinion, because it seems to me that we ought to do this on every bill that impacts the health of our people. We should remember the children, the pregnant women, the frail elderly, the ill. They cannot afford to hire lobbyists to come into the Halls of Congress to knock on my door or your door, Mr. President, and fight for their health and safety. They simply cannot do it. Little babies cannot do it. They count on us to protect them. In this bill, we are doing that. We are taking into account their special needs. So, today, I am very happy. In closing, I want to mention two other issues that relate to this bill, one of which is particularly important because the South Tahoe Public Utility District needs urgent help in replacing its wastewater export pipeline system, which protects and preserves the water quality in that most magnificent of all lakes, Lake Tahoe. We were able, thanks to the chairman and the ranking member, to list this as a project that should be considered by the Administrator of EPA, should there be sufficient funds. I hope, Mr. President, that the EPA Administrator will recognize the beauty and the vulnerability and the national gift that Lake Tahoe is, and that we will be able to help them fix their problem. On the disappointment side, I don't have many. The chairman and the ranking member were very helpful in getting authorization in this bill for the Southwest Center for Environmental Research and Policy, which is a consortium of universities in Mexico, California, Arizona, New Mexico, and other States, which is going to look into the serious pollution problems we have at our border region with Mexico. We had the authorization, but the Science Committee in the House asserted its jurisdiction and, unfortunately, removed this provision. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House from the San Diego area to resolve this problem. To my chairman and my ranking member, let me say that a Senator could not be more blessed than to be able to work with Senators like you and staffs like the staffs that you have. I hope we can work together for many more years. As a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee I want to commend Senator Chafee, Senator Baucus, Senator Kempthorne, and Senator Reid for their extraordinary effort on this bill. The safe drinking water bill we are passing today, is a significant step forward in helping to ensure that one of the most fundamental needs of any society--safe drinking water--is available to all Americans. This bill will lead to the crafting of a regulatory program to meet this goal at the lowest possible cost and with the most flexibility feasible for the thousands of local water supply systems. This bill makes very significant progress in the protection of public health. It effectively addresses legitimate concerns about overly burdensome regulation and lack of funding. And it establishes the critically important State revolving loan fund to help States and municipalities comply with Federal law. Mr. President I want to highlight two specific items included in this bill which I worked very hard to achieve. As a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I have for years worked to protect children and other sensitive subpopulations from contaminants in drinking water. I am therefore very pleased that this bill includes language that reflects the amendment I successfully attached to the safe drinking water bill in the last Congress, and worked to incorporate into the bill this Congress. The language in this bill requires that EPA drinking water standards be set at levels that take into account the special vulnerability of our children, our infants, pregnant women, our elderly, the chronically ill, and other groups that are at substantially higher risk than the average healthy adult. This is a very important step forward. I am also pleased that this bill incorporates a strong version of the consumer confidence reports amendment that Senator Daschle and I offered during Senate consideration of the bill. This is especially important in light of continued reports that many Americans are worried about getting sick from tap water contaminants. The new consumer confidence reports requirement means that consumers will once a year get a report from the water company serving their neighborhood, about the source, the quality, and the safety of their drinking water. The information provided in the report will be simple and straightforward. Consumers have a right to be informed at least once a year about the levels of contaminants found in their drinking water. These consumer confidence reports will empower consumers to take precautionary measures to protect themselves and the most vulnerable members of their family, such as a grandparent or a young child, for example, by boiling water or installing special filters. It is a pleasure Mr. President, to see this conference report pass today. In closing I would like to briefly mention two other issues: I am pleased that the South Tahoe Public Utility District waste water export system project was included on the list of special projects to be considered by the Administrator of EPA if there are sufficient funds. The South Tahoe Public Utility District needs urgent help in replacing its export pipeline system which protects and preserves the water quality in Lake Tahoe. The export pipeline transports reclaimed water from the wastewater treatment plant in South Tahoe out of the Lake Tahoe basin to a nearby reservoir where the reclaimed water is stored and later used for irrigation and other purposes. The existing pipeline is reaching the end of its useful life and must be replaced quickly if we are to avoid the possibility of a catastrophic spill resulting in serious environmental harm to Lake Tahoe. Several serious leaks have already occurred over the last 2 years, and the risk of a rupture increases the longer if takes to complete the replacement project. The local community has raised $10 million towards replacement of the pipeline, but a total of $30 million will be needed. The local community is already paying sewer rates substantially higher than the average in California. If the pipeline is to be replaced in a timely manner, $10 million in Federal assistance is needed. While the local community might be able to pay for the pipeline replacement over the long term by enduring high utility rates, it will not get the job done as quickly as it could be done with Federal assistance. Such Federal assistance would enable the South Tahoe Public Utility District to complete the project in a more expeditious manner, reducing the chances of a large leak with serious environmental consequences for the lake. Last, I would like to mention my disappointment that authorization for the Southwest Center for Environmental Research and Policy [SCERP], which was included in the Senate-passed bill, was ","word.count":1829,"sep11":-5.24157303370786,"years":1996.61797752809,"days":576,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.140430120567921,"Topic 2":0.0744930433959091,"Topic 3":0.0662947472619686,"Topic 4":0.375739710181748,"Topic 5":0.0370260787929136,"Topic 6":0.00375471812303693,"Topic 7":0.00384736853646164,"Topic 8":0.0695035469308719,"Topic 9":0.00838779583161954,"Topic 10":0.22052287037755},{"id":"11020080043585","body":"Orrin G. Hatch: Mr. President, I rise to express my opposition to and disappointment with the fiscal year 2009 budget resolution before us today. Interestingly enough, I listened to the Senator from New York talk about how the rich are getting away with things. Well, the upper 1 percent of all taxpayers paid 39 percent of all income taxes the last time I heard. The upper 5 percent paid 60 percent of the total income tax in this country. The upper 50 percent pay 97 percent of all the total income tax in this country. The bottom 50 percent generally pay almost nothing, and a good percentage of them get money from the Federal Government. So what is he talking about? I think it was Yogi Berra who once said, ``This is like deja vu all over again.'' I am sure he was not talking about the Federal budget when he uttered these oft-quoted words, but he might as well have been. As I look at the budget resolution before us today, and as I listen to the arguments on both sides of the aisle, it seems to me that we could be talking about last year's budget resolution. The numbers are somewhat larger, but the arguments are about the same. Now this might not be so bad if the budget resolution were a good one. No, you would not hear me complaining about a repeat of a budget that strengthened our economy, addressed our near-term problems, and prepared this country for the longer-term budget challenges of the future. Unfortunately, this is not the case. In fact, quite the opposite is true. Once we were through with that resolution last year, it didn't even resemble what the budget resolution was calling for. In fact, I have been here for 31 years, and not one day has the conservative point of view been dominant in the Senate. The liberal point of view, with almost all liberal Democrats and a few liberal Republicans, has held sway. That is where all the spending is coming from. Instead, we are, once again, talking about a budget that raises taxes by an unprecedented amount, which will do untold harm to our economy, exacerbates our near-term problems by not holding spending in check, and totally ignores the longer-term mandatory program challenges of the future. Much has already been said on this floor about the budget resolution and its failings. I could add a great deal more, but instead I choose to focus my remarks on three premises on which this budget is based. Three premises that, unfortunately, are false. And every child in Sunday school knows that false premises are like the house whose foundation is built upon sand. We all know that a house built upon sand, or a budget built upon false premises, cannot stand. The first faulty premise underlying this budget resolution is that it would not raise taxes on Americans. I know that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have said and will continue to say that this budget does not raise one cent in taxes. Technically speaking, this is true. However, while the document before us may contain no actual tax increase language, it does nothing to prevent the largest tax increase ever, which is set to occur at the end of 2010 if the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts are allowed to expire as scheduled. The American people need to ask a simple question of this budget. What is it doing to make sure that my tax bill does not go up in 2010? They will be met with deafening silence. Now, those on the other side will try and explain this deficiency away. They will argue that allowing a tax cut to expire is not the same thing as raising taxes. Well, try telling that to the 116 million American taxpayers who will face higher taxes if these tax cuts are allowed to expire. Try explaining this nuance to the 43 million American families who, on average, will owe $2,300 more, and to the 18 million seniors who will pay an average of $2,200 more. This is not small potatoes. Families that do not consider themselves rich, that struggle to make ends meet, and that are doing all they can to make the mortgage and save for college, are going to get hit with massive tax bills. They are going to see their paychecks shrink by hundreds of dollars every pay period. This is real money. Money that families could use to pay medical bills or pay tuition, and instead it is going to go to the Federal Government. It will not be much fun trying to explain this to the owners and managers of 27 million American small businesses. Try telling them that their higher tax bill is not really a tax increase. No, not at all. It is merely the reversal of a temporary lower tax rate they should have been grateful to have gotten for a decade, due to the generosity of Uncle Sam, who no longer deems it necessary to throw such favors their way. Good luck selling that one. I will tell you one thing--I do not want to tell the hundreds of thousands of Utah families, seniors, and small business owners that the extra dollars we were letting them keep for a few years are now needed for more urgent things, such as higher spending in Washington. So if this is not a tax increase, I do not know what is. The other side can call it what it wants. But if the end result is more money coming to Washington, and less money staying in the paycheck, the family budget, or the small business expansion account, this is a T-A- X, Tax! We have heard the other side talk about how they are for extending the middle-class elements of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts. We have even heard them say that the budget resolution provides for this, through the adoption of an amendment offered by the Senator from Montana. $323 billion for middle-class tax relief. Does any of this sound familiar? It should, because the same amendment was offered, and adopted, in last year's budget resolution. I have a question about that tax relief. Where is it? What happened? Last year's Baucus amendment offered pretty much the same kind of tax relief as this year's version. But, why did we need to adopt it again? The answer, of course, is that nothing happened because the tax changes necessary to carry out the stated intent of this amendment were never brought up in the Finance Committee or on the floor of this Senate. This is a shell game. The reason why is that you have to look at the fine print on this amendment to see what is really going on. The Baucus amendment allows only for the consideration of so-called middle-class tax relief. It does not, however, provide a means to offset the lost revenue. Under the Democratic pay-go rules, along with the $323 billion of tax relief that the Baucus amendment purports to offer, there is an asterisk with fine print that says, provided that the revenue can be found to offset it. My goodness. So this explains why we need the Baucus amendment again. The reason we did not provide that middle-class tax relief is that we could not find the revenue to offset it. But what about what my friend and colleague, the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, says? He points to the tax gap and says we can get the money there. All we have to do is stop some of the leakage in our tax system. I agree with my colleague from North Dakota. I agree that we should be able to reduce the tax gap. It is too large and it is inexcusable why $200 to $300 billion or more in taxes that are due go uncollected each year. But you know what? Our tax system, as leaky and clumsy and unfair and antiquated as it is, is the envy of much of the world as far as the percentage due that we collect. Can we do better? Of course. Do we need to crack down on tax abuse domestically and overseas? Indeed we do. Can we raise enough money by closing the tax gap to offset the revenue loss of the amendment of the Senator from Montana? Not even close. As Senator Grassley very eloquently demonstrated on this floor on Monday, the real potential for revenue from the tax gap is very, very small in comparison to what the other side is claiming. If not, then where are the specific proposals from the other side to do it? Why haven't they been enacted, if it is so easy to get this revenue? The tax increases inherent in this budget resolution will do untold damage to our economy. Even if the other side can find the votes to increase taxes enough to overcome the pay-go problem associated with some of the middle-class tax relief proposed by the Senator from Montana, we would still be doing major harm to the economy. We can perhaps look to the model provided for us by the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee in his so-called Mother Tax bill. It is so named because my good friend Chairman Rangel said it represents the Mother of All Tax Reforms. His ranking member, Congressman McCrery, more aptly describes it as the Mother of All Tax Hikes. I can tell you right now, as much as I hate to say this about my friend Charlie Rangel, Congressman McCrery is right. This ``mother'' bill includes plenty of tax offsets. It would increase the income tax rates across the board to where they were in 2001, with the top rate exceeding 40 percent at the margin. This may sound as if it would affect only the wealthy, but this is another false premise. In reality, it would affect millions and millions of small and midsized businesses, the great majority of which pay their taxes through the individual Tax Code. How is this going to help us solve the economic problems our Nation is facing? This budget is nothing but a recipe for disaster. The second faulty premise underlying this budget resolution is that the increase in spending it authorizes will solve our long-term economic problems. Yes, I think we have heard this before as well. Yes, it was last year in the fiscal year 2008 budget debate. That budget resolution called for $205 billion in increased spending over 5 years, and this number ballooned to $350 billion over 10 years. Apparently, this amount was not high enough, so this budget ups the amount to $210 billion over the next 5 years, and it will have the same ballooning effect over the years beyond because the spending gets built into the baseline","word.count":3147,"sep11":6.66573033707865,"years":2008.52528089888,"days":4815,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.242719920463689,"Topic 2":0.147657482987081,"Topic 3":0.0120106160436503,"Topic 4":0.00968217559050512,"Topic 5":0.0209445150169315,"Topic 6":0.268458069598615,"Topic 7":0.00887478502350161,"Topic 8":0.150487394657303,"Topic 9":0.13194582484643,"Topic 10":0.00721921577229243},{"id":"10920060007516","body":"Tom Cole: Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding I rise to support the rule and the underlying bill. And I want to first, Mr. Chairman, commend you. I have watched this process unfold in front of us as we have worked, as you and the Speaker committed we would, through regular order, through five different committees, over 4 months, entertaining dozens of amendments. I have watched you struggle with the numerous amendments we had, and yet try to get them down to a manageable level, things that actually counted and made a difference in the legislation that let us debate things. I have watched as you and the Speaker and others have tried to craft a bill that moved us forward, and indeed this bill does move us forward. After all of the smoke and all of the rhetoric and everything is said, the real basic question is simply this: Will we be better off with or without this bill? There is no question we will be better off with this bill. We will be more transparent, we will have more reporting by lobbyists, stricter supervision, higher penalties for those who transgress, whether they be those amongst us or others in the lobbying and the political community. We have a measure of campaign finance reform that could be triggered by this legislation. And indeed as you pointed out, Mr. Speaker, this is simply the first step of a long journey. And it is very important. I appreciate the way that you have dealt with the dilemma of having some who want to go further than we are able to go, and actually enact legislation, and those who do not want to do anything at all. And it is always easiest to take one of those two positions, because you are always right. You never have to answer for anything. But at the end of the day, the Speaker and the chairman have to craft a package that will pass and will put them in a position to negotiate with the Senate. I think they have done that. I also wanted to highlight just briefly an amendment that may come up later in this debate, which is indeed bipartisan in nature, and which I think takes us in the right direction in appropriately regulating private travel, something that has been an abuse, and where I have had the good fortune of working with my friends across the aisle, Mr. Miller, Mr. Berman. I had the opportunity to also work with Mr. Hastings and Mr. Lungren, and we think we have crafted an amendment that everybody in this House can be pleased with. That would not have happened without your help, Mr. Chairman, and without your support. Let me conclude by saying, I am very proud to have worked with my friend, the chairman on the Rules Committee. I appreciate his support as we have worked through difficult issues. I know we are at the beginning of a long debate.

The Big Red One has an unsurpassed history of answering the call to duty, and it is vital to our Nation's fight against determined enemies. We are fortunate to have these fine soldiers defending our freedom. As the oldest, continuously serving division in the history of the U.S. Army, the Big Red One enjoys a long and proud tradition of defending America. It also has a tradition of being the first. During World War II, Big Red One was the first to reach England, the first to capture a German city, the first to fight in North Africa, and the first on the beaches of Normandy on D-day. It was the first division to deploy to Vietnam and spearheaded the armored attack into Iraq at the start of Desert Storm. The Big Red One has a long and proud heritage that we should honor and celebrate. On August 1, 2006, I was proud to welcome the Big Red One's headquarters back to Fort Riley, KS. The division has a vital, new mission of training military transition teams for both Iraq and Afghanistan. This intense training is meant to prepare our finest military members to train their counterparts in the Iraqi and Afghani militaries. We honor those soldiers who have committed to this mission.

Further, the resolution acknowledges the Haitian people's needs for sustained support and assistance from the United States and indeed the international community to ensure social and economic development. The elections took place February 7 with 2.2 million Haitians, over 60 percent of the registered voters, participating. There were only minor reports of violence and voting flaws. This bill recognizes the perseverance of the Haitian people as they struggle to maintain democracy. Many Haitians walked miles on election day to reach a polling station, and they waited hours in line to exercise their right to vote. The participation of an overwhelming number of Haitians in these elections clearly demonstrates the commitment of the Haitian people to democracy. I support the Waters resolution, House Concurrent Resolution 353, a resolution to commend the people of Haiti for the success of their recent election and congratulates President-elect Rene Preval on his victory in the elections. President-elect Rene Preval defeated a large field of candidates and won the election with over 51 percent of the vote. The people of Haiti have suffered tremendously as a result of violence and natural disasters, and the elections are a sign of hope for the future of the Haitian people. This resolution pledges the support of Congress and the assistance of the United States for national reconciliation, democracy, and development for the people of Haiti. Finally, this resolution embodies the hope that many of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle share, that democracy, stability, and prosperity will be realized as Haitians move beyond these recent elections and put the turbulent chapter behind them.

But we just plain--I think the big argument is, this is another entitlement that continues to go on and on and escalate on and on, and to which there is no lid, there is no cap. It is a never-ending type thing that just puts us into even more of a budgetary difficulty than we have been in before. All of us want to help people who do not have the training. We know the way to get people off welfare is to get them trained; give them job training, give them the education, the vocational education and other things that will help them to become self-supporting, self-sufficient citizens. But we want to get away from the entitlement approach, which just allows people to make ingenious arguments that they should have something that really the State has not provided or does not think it is advisable to provide. I do believe, if you read this carefully, it is subject to litigation. But be that as it may, the fourth reason I would give as to why we really should not support this amendment is that this is similar to the Daschle bill, in that it says there is a time limit, but there are so many exemptions that there is not really a time limit. The major exemption is this. It creates a loophole. Those who are deemed by the State as work ready can insist on going through job training and other services in order to avoid work in the private sector. That is one of the things that this amendment will do. And there are people who take advantage after advantage after advantage of the job training and other services, rather than having to go get a job in the private sector and work every day and do what they should do, support themselves and/or their families if they have a family. Again, I have to say that I know what the distinguished Senator is doing. I know her heart is right. I know she is trying to do what is right. But it is a difference in philosophy. We have had 60 years now of entitlement programs that have been eating the American public, the taxpayers, alive and not doing the job. They are not doing the job. In fact, they are doing a lousy job, and they are eating us alive, they are ruining the country. And now we are going to add another entitlement to this when we write a bill that literally will get job training and other related services to the people as they need it. And we have the States develop and administer these programs.","word.count":487,"sep11":-6.15449438202247,"years":1995.70505617978,"days":251,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0104708945701054,"Topic 2":0.0180354166141628,"Topic 3":0.00957994296322325,"Topic 4":0.00404954871425876,"Topic 5":0.00155015436293556,"Topic 6":0.00321568316880622,"Topic 7":0.21627601469253,"Topic 8":0.00691020523745026,"Topic 9":0.726535281912044,"Topic 10":0.00337685776448455},{"id":"11020070082288","body":"Dianne Feinstein: For the 14 years I have served on the Immigration Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, I have become more and more convinced that what we have is a broken system. To me, the word ``comprehensive'' means fixing a broken system. The system is broken in many different directions. In one direction, every year, year in, year out, 700,000 to 800,000 people cross the border looking for hope, opportunity, work, or to reunite with family. They come into this country in an illegal status, and they disappear. There is a portion of our economy that welcomes immigrant labor. They are able to find work. They are able to hide. They are able to falsify documents. I have personally gone to Alvarado Street in Los Angeles and seen where, in 20 minutes, you can obtain a green card, a driver's license, a Social Security card. You cannot tell the difference between a real and a fraudulent document. The border is broken in that we cannot protect it. Secondly, it is estimated that 40 percent of the people here illegally are visa overstays. Some go back after awhile. Some never go back. What does this constitute? It constitutes a silent amnesty because these people exist in America. They are able to work in America. Most are never found by authorities. Those who are found are similar to the Munoz family in San Diego. A few weeks ago, a mother and a father were deported in the middle of the night. They have three American children, the oldest of which is 16. They own their home. They both work. They own their furniture. In the middle of the night, Immigration Naturalization Service comes in, picks up the parents and deports them. This is an actual case--the house is gone, the furniture is gone, the three children are living with an aunt in San Diego. Why? Because they could be found, or because perhaps somebody reported them, but they could be found. But the dominant number of people here illegally cannot be found. What this bill tries to do is fix the broken border. We fix it with infrastructure. We say this new infrastructure, whether it is UAVs or vehicle barriers or fencing, has to be in place before anything else is done. The bill mandates $4.4 billion upfront in spending for border enforcement. This money will be used to carry out the enforcement triggers. That is one part of the fix.

I would like to thank the chairwoman of this committee, Barbara Vucanovich, who has once again moved this bill swiftly through the Appropriations Committee and the conference committee, and I am sad to say will be doing it for the last time. I want to wish her well and would like to personally thank her for the service that she has provided to this important subcommittee and this institution. I would also like to thank the ranking member of the Subcommittee, Bill Hefner, for his help and assistance in bringing this legislation to the floor. This bill provides nearly $10 billion in fiscal year 1997 for military construction, family housing and military base closures. This bill continues this House's commitment to funding initiatives that upgrade the quality of life for the men and women of the armed forces and their families. Mr. Speaker, I would like to highlight a few important projects in the bill that are important to the Air Force bases in my district. The first project is the ongoing renovation of the dormitories at Travis AFB. This bill provides funding for one dormitory scheduled for construction this year, and funding to speed up construction of a second dorm at Travis. Additionally, this bill includes $8.63 million for the construction of 70 multi-family housing units for enlisted personnel stationed at Travis. This project goes a long way to improve Travis' housing situation. The construction of the dormitories are part of a base-wide project to upgrade and improve base housing in order to meet Air Force requirements. This bill also provides funds to replace Travis' underground fueling system. The system was designed to provide a quick and efficient way to refuel two jets at one time. Travis currently relies on an underground system from the 1950's, which often fails because of electrical shorts which occur after rainstorms. The new fuel system is safer and more efficient than the fuel trucks on the runway. It will also put an end to the occasional leaks which are so bad for the environment. These upgrades are a clear sign that Travis is, and will remain, vital to Air Mobility Command's mission. Mr. Speaker, this bill also provides for three projects at Beale AFB: the closure of Landfill No. 2, the CARS Deployable Ground Station Support Facility and 56 units of family housing. Funding for the closure of Landfill No. 2 will allow the base to comply with California standards governing landfills. Currently, Beale is out of compliance with California law. The bill also will provide for the construction of a new home for the Contingency Airborne Reconnaissance System [CARS] Deployable Ground Station [DGS]. The DGS is an important mission that provides Air Force commanders with a satellite downlink that provides critical information from the battlefield. The current facility is stationed in mobile trailers and is unable to adequately support this mission. Failure to provide adequate support for this function would significantly degrade CARS operational capability to provide theater commanders worldwide with dynamic, responsive intelligence support for battlefield management and execution. Finally, funding is provided for 56 family housing units on base. Funding for the 56 units of family housing at Beale is the second phase of a multi-year plan to eventually replace 1,700 family housing units on base. The new housing will significantly improve the quality of life for those stationed on base. Current housing facilities are substandard and are in need of being replaced. Mr. Speaker, each of the initiatives I have outlined will help maintain Travis AFB and Beale AFB as critical defense assets and as integral parts of their respective communities. The projects that I have indicated are important to the ongoing missions at each base. In closing, I want to reiterate my support for this important bill that provides for the quality of life for our troops and is vitally important to maintaining military readiness.","word.count":664,"sep11":-5.24438202247191,"years":1996.61516853933,"days":575,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0721716023369715,"Topic 2":0.12644113604555,"Topic 3":0.154814473103185,"Topic 4":0.516357885259305,"Topic 5":0.0936902003272867,"Topic 6":0.0117147089494446,"Topic 7":0.00556163767433434,"Topic 8":0.00888875766741942,"Topic 9":0.00613989547608399,"Topic 10":0.00421970316041875},{"id":"10820040006523","body":"Neil Abercrombie: Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield a moment before he continues on that point.

I commend the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia for introducing this legislation and for her work on this issue as Chair of the Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management. Completed in 1899, the Old Post Office building was intended to be the U.S. Post Office Department Headquarters building as well as the city's main post office. The Old Post Office building was awarded a place on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. This Romanesque building is the second tallest structure and one of the first steel-frame buildings in the District of Columbia. Despite the magnificence of this building and its extraordinary location, it has been difficult to develop this building to its fullest potential. A renovation of the Old Post Office began in 1977 as part of the redevelopment of Pennsylvania Avenue. In 1982, the General Services Administration, GSA, entered into a 55-year lease with a private sector developer to lease and operate the Old Post Office building. The building was renovated as a multifunctional building that included office space, retail, and a food court. Unfortunately, this redevelopment effort was not successful because of high turnover among the retail businesses and low satisfaction among tenants. The original developer went into bankruptcy and the lender foreclosed on the leasehold. Today, the Old Post Office building is an aging historical building that is inefficient, underutilized, and a financial drain on the Federal Building Fund. The building's large atrium and other factors contribute to the high costs of operating and maintaining the building. The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure has provided oversight and direction to GSA previously in attempts to foster the development of the Old Post Office, including requiring that GSA submit a viable development plan for the Old Post Office before any Federal funds be used to convert the space. Notwithstanding these efforts, the desired development has not occurred. H.R. 5001, the ``Old Post Office Building Redevelopment Act of 2008'', authorizes the Administrator of General Services to enter into an agreement to redevelop the Old Post Office Building in a manner that is beneficial to the Federal Government. This bill will not only help spur the redevelopment of this building but also help ensure that the taxpayers get the fullest return from this historic and treasured structure. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of H.R. 5001, the ``Old Post Office Building Redevelopment Act of 2008.''","word.count":274,"sep11":5.82303370786517,"years":2007.68258426966,"days":4515,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.154342961593716,"Topic 2":0.095453550104895,"Topic 3":0.0756698969591985,"Topic 4":0.0390954899600274,"Topic 5":0.00899523412465548,"Topic 6":0.00380821878879052,"Topic 7":0.530765882759779,"Topic 8":0.0327989655328721,"Topic 9":0.052233513645634,"Topic 10":0.00683628653043245},{"id":"10920050007923","body":"Joe Barton: Mr. Speaker, I rise today, as a Member of Congress and a parent, to thank the many law enforcement officers whose hard work resulted in yesterday's capture of escaped child sexual predator Michael Benson.

Because of the action we are taking today, those between the ages of 65 and 69 who continue to work will no longer have a portion of their Social Security benefits withheld. The ``earnings test'' in current law reduces the Social Security benefits of those in the 65 to 69 age group by $1 for every $3 they earn annually over $17,000. It affects nearly eight hundred thousand men and women each year. It unfairly denies them a portion of the Social Security benefits which they have earned by a lifetime of hard work. Once this bill is signed into law, these seniors will receive the full benefits to which they are entitled whether or not they choose to remain in the workforce after age 65. President Clinton has urged Congress to repeal the earnings limit, and he will sign the bill as soon as it reaches his desk. Repeal of the earnings limit is the right thing for us to do, and now is the time for us to do it. The concept of an earnings limit goes back to the Depression era when Social Security was first enacted. At that time, unemployment was high and it was hoped that the creation of Social Security would encourage older workers to retire and create openings for younger men and women who desperately needed jobs. The employment picture today is dramatically different. We face a shortage of skilled workers and our economy can benefit from the continued participation of older workers in the workforce. Their experience and sound judgment is a national resource. Men and women in their late sixties are healthier than in generations past and the majority of jobs no longer involve physical exertion. Those who choose to work beyond age 65 should not have financial barriers erected in their paths. The earnings limit in current law is such a barrier and it should be removed without further delay. The most important aspect of repealing the earnings limit is that it will increase the freedom of senior citizens to work or retire as they choose. When to retire is an intensely personal decision--influenced by the individual's health, the financial needs of their family, their career interests, and the nature of the work that is available to them. The rules of Social Security should not restrict a senior's range of choice. Those who decide to continue working after age 65 and those who decide to retire should be treated equitably. Both groups should be eligible to receive the full Social Security benefits they have earned. In 1996, I was pleased to join with my Senate colleagues in voting to raise the earnings limit gradually over the succeeding five years. Because of that amendment, the financial burden on thousands of senior citizens has already been reduced. With enactment of this legislation, which I wholeheartedly support, the burden of the earnings limit will be completely eliminated, so that all seniors receive full Social Security benefits, whether or not they remain in the workforce after age 65. They have earned it. Several of my colleagues have used this legislation as an opportunity to voice their perspective on the future of Social Security, and they have painted a bleak picture. I strongly disagree with their characterizations. Social Security is fundamentally sound. It has sufficient resources to fully fund current benefits for 35 years. Due to the gradual aging of the American population, Social Security will begin to experience a revenue shortfall after 2035. However, if we plan for the future by addressing this problem in the near term, that revenue shortfall can be eliminated with relatively minor adjustments to the system. The benefit expectations of future recipients can be preserved, and the solvency of Social Security insured for future generations. We need to preserve the program as an inflation adjusted guaranteed benefit for those who depend on it to pay for the basic necessities of life. For two-thirds of America's senior citizens, Social Security retirement benefits provide more than half their annual income. For 42 percent of them, it constitutes more than three-quarters of their income. Social Security enables millions of elderly to spend their retirement years in security and dignity. Without Social Security, half the nation's elderly would be living in poverty. Converting a portion of Social Security into private investment accounts, as some have suggested, would be much too risky for elderly men and women who have no other source of financial security. The major proposals which would direct a portion of each worker's payroll taxes into private accounts would all reduce the level of guaranteed Social Security benefits substantially. Whether or not a retiree made up those lost dollars would depend on factors largely beyond his or her control. Workers who reach retirement age during an economic downturn cannot simply delay their retirement indefinitely until the market goes up. Private accounts, subject to the ups and downs of the stock market, are fine as a supplement to Social Security. But, they are no substitute for Social Security. President Clinton's budget proposal would use the debt service savings which will result from paying down the national debt over the next fifteen years to extend the life of the Social Security Trust Fund. Since the current Social Security surplus is being used to pay down the debt, it is appropriate for the Social Security Trust Fund to receive the resulting savings. More than half of the projected shortfall in the Trust Fund over the next 75 years could be eliminated by adopting this policy. If we dedicated all of the savings in debt service costs to the Social Security Trust Fund, the solvency of the system would be extended to beyond 2050, fully providing for the retirement of the baby boom generation. We need to address the long term financial problems of Social Security in a way which keeps faith with the historic mission of the program--to provide senior citizens with a guaranteed, inflation adjusted benefit which will enable them to live in security and dignity. I urge all my colleagues to support the Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act.

If it does, we will have decreasing supplies of fuel and ever-increasing prices. I don't think that is where we intend to go. I rise to give strong support to amendment No. 1628 offered by my colleagues, Senator Jim Bunning and ranking member Pete Domenici. The amendment establishes a fuel mandate program for coal-to-liquid fuel that is identical to the renewable fuel standard we are implementing with this legislation. I know originally the two amendments had some similarities and were being worked on as one with a bipartisan group. That is what we ought to do. But somehow it got polarized and shifted into two separate amendments. One could have phased into the other and wound up with much stronger requirements. That was where I was hoping it would go, on a phased-in basis, so that we could actually have coal-to-liquid technology and that infant industry could then grow into one that would meet the strict standards that technologically cannot be met at the present time. If we discourage all development of coal to liquids, we will not have clean coal to liquids. We will not have an adequate fuel supply or we will have a fuel supply that is very expensive, and that will curtail the economy.

As Chairman of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Disaster Prevention and Prediction, I traveled to the gulf coast to see the destruction caused by Hurricane Katrina. My heart went out to the victims and their families, and my hope was to see the infrastructure there restored as quickly as possible to avoid further destruction and loss of life. Unfortunately, Federal law places barriers on our efforts to respond to Hurricane Katrina quickly and efficiently. The Inspector General at the U.S. Department of Labor concluded in a May 2004 report that 84 percent of Davis-Bacon wage determination surveys take more than a year and a half to complete, forcing emergency projects to use outdated wage determinations and to suffer needless delays. The Davis-Bacon Act also prohibits the use of entry-level workers classified as ``helpers'' on federally funded projects, and artificially raises construction costs by up to 33 percent. Furthermore, the Davis-Bacon Act discourages many small businesses from bidding on public projects, because contractors who are unfamiliar with the complex set of laws and regulations often choose not to participate in reconstruction efforts or end up being cited or sued for naively violating laws. For these reasons, Davis-Bacon regulations were suspended by Executive Order 11 days after Hurricane Katrina ravaged the Gulf Coast. Knowing what we know now, it is unconscionable for us to force victims of future disasters to suffer through any waiting period before we remove barriers to reconstruction. The CARE Act would automatically trigger a year-long suspension of Davis-Bacon Act rules in all future disaster sites that receive an emergency declaration from the President.

Dingell: I repeat what has been heard many times here today. I believe this is the most important vote we are going to cast this entire year in Congress. I strongly support the constitutional amendment to a balanced budget. We need it to save the country. Mr. President, $5 trillion of debt is too much. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the balanced budget amendment. Last March, as we debated this amendment, I noted the great importance of this issue. I believe that this is more true today than it was last year. Government spending has put the American people $5.1 trillion into debt. In this Chamber, we often speak about the national debt as the Federal Government debt, but, of course, this debt will be paid by the American people. The American people--not the Federal Government--will work to pay the taxes that go toward these Treasury bonds. The American people--not the Federal Government--will manufacture products, raise crops, program computers, and do the millions of jobs that generate growth in our economy. So, although we are entrusted to spend the money that the American people work to earn, we continue to struggle to balance the Federal budget. This Congress passed a balanced budget--the first legitimate balanced budget plan in a generation--but the President vetoed it. This Congress made the tough choices, but the President exploited our good work for political advantage, and he demagoged the issues. Unfortunately, without the Amendment as an enforcement mechanism, I do not believe that a balanced budget will be passed and signed into law. It stops the posturing and the revolving votes and the other games that will bankrupt the next generations. I am not eager to amend the Constitution. We have done so just 27 times in over two centuries. It is a serious matter. Senators are right to take pause before casting a vote to amend our Constitution. Unfortunately, however, I have concluded that this amendment is necessary. The national debt is just too large. In the 1820's, President Andrew Jackson, a North Carolinian by birth, called the national debt ``a curse to the republic'' and ``incompatible with real independence.'' In the early 19th century, however, the Federal Government was disciplined and successfully paid off the national debt. That is no longer true today. The specter of a $5.1 trillion national debt is apparently insufficient to force this Government to bring the budget into balance. Interest on the national debt, which we continue to wrack up, is the third largest component of the Federal budget. The average taxpayer will send $882 to the IRS in 1996 just to pay the interest on the national debt. Interest alone will consume 41 percent of the income taxes that the American people send to the Treasury. If these facts do not shock us into support for a balanced budget-- not rhetoric, Mr. President, but votes for a balanced budget--then we are forced to amend the Constitution. We owe it to the next generation. The average child born today faces a lifetime tax burden of $187,000 just to pay the interest on the national debt. In effect, we hand a $187,000 bill to every newborn American along with his birth certificate. We do this because the President vetoed the first balanced budget in a some 20 years. In this Chamber, we often speak about obligations to future generations, but we are imposing trillions of dollars of debt upon our children and grandchildren. How many of us look forward to explaining this to them? How can we explain this to them? What will we say? Can we really tell them that it is fair to welcome them to the world with a $187,000 bill? All because we do not want to offend the groups that line up for a piece of the Federal pie. President Clinton talks about deep cuts and draconian cuts. What cuts will our children make in their family budgets to pay off this $187,000 bill? All because the President will lose a campaign issue if we slow the rate of increase in Federal spending. Is that really too much to ask? There are claims on the other side of the aisle of support for a balanced budget. However, the first balanced budget in a generation passed in this Chamber on November 18, 1995, with no Democrat votes, and it was vetoed by a Democrat President. The Constitution, as we all know, was amended to permit the imposition of an income tax. I hope that few Senators consider the 16th Amendment amongst the more high-minded provisions of the Constitution. Mr. President, if we can amend the Constitution to increase taxes on the American people, I hope that we can amend it to ensure that their government spends their hard-earned money responsibly. Thomas Jefferson first read the Constitution upon his return from France and recommended that the Constitution include limitations upon the powers of the Federal Government to borrow. Mr. President, if we do not impose a restraint on the power of this government to borrow, we will not balance the budget and ensure that it remains balanced.","word.count":799,"sep11":-5.98033707865169,"years":1995.87921348315,"days":313,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.256698741586022,"Topic 2":0.361409684013145,"Topic 3":0.059440020442954,"Topic 4":0.0802126826412365,"Topic 5":0.0622931173462832,"Topic 6":0.0164950897280636,"Topic 7":0.0200862184892836,"Topic 8":0.0484550170804622,"Topic 9":0.0216721516972123,"Topic 10":0.073237276975338},{"id":"10419960085323","body":"Richard Shelby: Mr. President, I want to congratulate the chairman for reporting out a bill that provides funding for many important programs, while at the same time moving toward our goal of balancing the budget.

The fact is, in our country, we do a lot of things together. When we do things together, there is an obligation for all of us to pay for it--educating our kids, building our roads, paying for our police and fire protection, and providing for the common defense of our country. That is what we must do in our country, and all of us have an obligation to pay for some of that. And we do that through taxes. None of us enjoys it, perhaps, but I happen to consider the taxes I pay a good investment in my children's education. I am pleased I do. I happen to consider the taxes that I pay something that I am proud to do to support the men and women, for example, who serve in our Armed Forces and risk their lives in defense of this country's liberty and freedom. So I think we ought to talk about what is it that makes a good country and what are our obligations to each other and to our country. About 6 months ago, I went to Dulles Airport to meet an airplane. I had about a month or two prior to that been watching television and saw on television a young woman in Bosnia whose parents had been killed, who had been critically wounded herself, and who lay in a hospital for some long while. Her brother, in the same attack that killed her parents and critically wounded her, was miraculously spared, and he was able to come to the United States. She, on the other hand, when she recovered from her wounds, after laying in critical condition, having lost her parents and then her brother having been taken from her, was living in a single room with a candle trying to study, despondent over losing her family. I decided I was going to see if I could help this young woman somehow, and I did. She came to the United States, and I picked her up at Dulles Airport and reunited her with her brother. Coincidentally, this happened 1 year to the day after my daughter had died. I was thinking on the way to the airport to meet this young woman from Bosnia who had suffered from such tragedy a lot of things that were very emotional for me, because we could not do much to save my daughter, and yet I thought perhaps I was helping some other young woman start a new life. I felt at least in some ways maybe there was some opportunity to reach out. Her plane arrived and she got off the plane and was overcome with emotion as she met her brother, whom she never expected again to see. She cried and was extraordinarily emotional. When we were talking after this, she said to me, ``It was only something I barely was able to dream about, that I might some day ever come to the United States of America. You don't have any idea what this means to someone to be able to come to the United States of America. We view the United States as a land of opportunity, as a place where opportunity exists to live a good life and live in peace and live in freedom.'' I thought to myself, when she said that through her tears, that all of us in this Chamber, I think, and probably all of us in this country from time to time, take too much of this country for granted. If by chance we are able to hear from others what this country means to them, we can understand again what our great grandparents and grandparents and our parents helped build in this country.","word.count":697,"sep11":-6.36797752808989,"years":1995.49157303371,"days":175,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.866507744967002,"Topic 2":0.0347320412437095,"Topic 3":0.00683799686029072,"Topic 4":0.0202307419746535,"Topic 5":0.00604429369078404,"Topic 6":0.00773412067665411,"Topic 7":0.0324420198384059,"Topic 8":0.012445323174036,"Topic 9":0.0103249008649398,"Topic 10":0.00270081670952439},{"id":"10519980041808","body":"Mark Souder: For those of us who grew up in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the conservative movement, Ronald Reagan was our hero along with Barry Goldwater and William Buckley and a few others, and I actually was one of these conservative right wingers who came to Congress who was inspired originally by Ronald Reagan's speech for Barry Goldwater when I was merely 14 years old and formed one of the earliest high school YAF chapters and Americans for Freedom chapters the country, and, as you look at what we are about to face, this is what Ronald Reagan faced for 8 years. I am not going to stand up here and say that I like this budget agreement any more than Ronald Reagan, as President, liked the budget agreements he was given in 8 years in Congress. Yet he signed those budget agreements. The first year he got tax cuts, the other years he did not even get tax cuts. He got increased defense spending because he knew Congress wanted to spend more, and did we. One of the questions conservatives have to ask themselves as they vote on this budget is why are they so much better than Ronald Reagan, who they admire, if they vote ``no'' on this budget? Compromise is an unfortunate part of the political process. There are going to be many things in this bill that I am appalled by. I cannot believe that Members of Congress continue to take advantage of the legislative process when we are all under tremendous pressure to get special things for their friends and their district that might not be able to withstand scrutiny. I am very disappointed we do not have tax cuts in this bill. I cannot believe that we cannot even get an effective limitation on taxpayers' dollars being used to fund referendums overseas to overturn laws that are protecting innocent children from being aborted. American tax dollars are being used to fund pro-abortion referendums around this world. We have it tied to funding for the U.N. and for State Department reauthorization, but that to me seems like a no-brainer. But as long as we have the President we currently have in the White House, that becomes a very difficult victory. So I am not going to stand up here and say I like everything in this bill, but there are some things that in fact are important changes, and that is the art of compromise, and the President did give some ground, the Democrats in the House and Senate gave some ground, and we had to give some ground. In the education area in fact we made a lot of progress. The President will stand up and say he got 100,000 teachers or 40,000 teachers or whatever, but the fact is it moved back to the state level. We gave flexibility, and as the chairman of the Education Committee, Mr. Goodling, keeps pointing out, that in fact is what we were driving towards. We also have a ban on national testing so kids around this country are not slammed in under one major test. We have level funding on the National Endowment for the Arts, number of other things they worked with in the Education Committee. In addition to that, there are many of us who are very concerned that we have not developed an adequate missile defense in this country, and since we knew we were going to spend more on domestic issues, we wanted to make sure that the preparedness and the readiness of our Armed Forces, that the development of our missile defense systems, were going to be funded as well as the social spending. I am very concerned in this country about the expansion of pornography along with the expansion of Internet. We all know that whenever we have an expansion of technology, whether it be television, or whether it be computers, that that opens up things to our children and our families that we hoped would be, they could be protected from. Yet these advantages of technology have been wonderful for our country, but we need to the best we can, limit the pornography and the perversion from getting into our homes and making sure that minors do not have access to that. That was one of the last points negotiated in this bill. It is something that Dr. James Dobson in Focus on the Family has battled for for a decade, working on the Pornography Commission. We finally have a victory in the area of Internet porn. We have a number of extensions on tax extenders for self-employed businesses and for farmers that were very critical to many small businesses in my district and throughout the country. We have a whole range of what would be termed more minor issues relating to gun registries, relating to language on certain bills where in fact conservatives won, and that is how this process works. One last comment: Anybody who says that they are going to put aside money for Social Security, this is one more proof the only thing that government can do is either spend it or giver it back to you. We have once again seen the fraud of using senior citizens as a shield to cover real motives. In fact, we are spending 19 to 20 billion extra dollars, much of that will be in the baseline and be spent for future years, too. We have basically spent a big chunk, if not the majority, of the so-called surplus, and it did not go to seniors. That started when the President came up here with the State of the Union address, said I want everything put to Social Security, and then detailed for 20 pages new programs to spend that. Today we are seeing that come through. I am disappointed in that, but in the end this is a bill worth moving.","word.count":985,"sep11":-2.98314606741573,"years":1998.87640449438,"days":1380,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0136598416813378,"Topic 2":0.452866385545768,"Topic 3":0.0305563356747588,"Topic 4":0.00604679315298632,"Topic 5":0.100914489890582,"Topic 6":0.00254633829965018,"Topic 7":0.0082124279044388,"Topic 8":0.0125405362178798,"Topic 9":0.0660293519809461,"Topic 10":0.306627499651652},{"id":"10519980064095","body":"Dick Durbin: I think it is more likely a public health agency will try to reduce those numbers.

As my colleagues know, the House of Representatives in August passed a strong reform measure. I'm pleased that their action has prompted a renewed effort here in the Senate to pass a comprehensive campaign finance reform measure. I started my career in politics as a community activist, working to prevent a highway from demolishing my Fell's Point neighborhood. I don't want the next generation of community activists shut out of the process. I want them to know that their efforts matter. I want people to have an opportunity to participate in their communities and in our political process. I want to restore each American's faith and trust in government. The McCain-Feingold amendment is an important part of that effort. I have consistently supported campaign finance reform, so I will gladly vote to close debate on the McCain-Feingold amendment. I hope we will invoke cloture, and move quickly to a vote on final passage of this amendment. Vote after vote this year has shown that a majority of the Senate supports McCain-Feingold. Unfortunately, through parliamentary tactics and filibuster, a majority of the Senate has not been able to work its will on this issue. I hope we will be successful today in at last ending the filibuster on this issue. During my time in the United States Senate, I have voted 19 times to end filibusters on campaign finance reform. So I know we have a fight on our hands. But it is time for action, and it is time for reform. The American people are counting on us. I believe we need campaign finance reform for a number of reasons. First and most important, we need to restore people's faith in the integrity of government, the integrity of their elected officials, and the integrity of our political process. Many Americans are fed up with a political system that ignores our Nation's problems and places the concerns of working families behind those of big interests. Our campaign finance system contributes to a culture of cynicism that hurts our institutions, our government and our country. When Congress fails to enact legislation to save our kids from the public health menace of smoking because of the undue influence of Big Tobacco, it adds to that culture of cynicism. When powerful health care industry interests are able to block measures to provide basic patient protections for consumers who belong to HMOs, that adds to the culture of cynicism. Is it any wonder that Americans do not trust their elected leaders to act in the public interest? Today we have a chance to help break that culture of cynicism. We can enact legislation to eliminate the undue influence of special interests in elections. How does this amendment do that? First of all, it stems the flood of unregulated, unreported money in campaigns. It will ban soft money, money raised and spent outside of federal campaign rules and which violates the spirit of those rules. It will end the sham of ``issue ads'' that are really designed to support or oppose federal candidates. This amendment will improve the disclosure of contributions, and expand the Federal Election Commission's enforcement capabilities. It will codify the Beck decision, by allowing non-union members who pay fees in lieu of union dues to obtain a refund of the portion of those fees used for political activities. It will make it less likely for wealthy candidates to try to buy elections, by barring political parties from making coordinated expenditures for candidates who do not agree to limit their personal spending. These are all reasonable reforms. They will get the big money and the secret money out of campaigns. They will help to strengthen democracy and strengthen the people's faith in their elected officials. Mr. President, we can improve our political process, making it more fair and more inclusive, without compromising our rights under the Constitution. By limiting the influence of those with big dollars, and increasing the influence of those with big hearts, we can bring government back to where it belongs--with the people.

People say: How can this happen? The reality is that today, while the companies say, oh, no, they cannot possibly lower prices at all because they would have to cut research, we know today that they spend two and a half times more on advertising, marketing, and administration than they do on research. When we look at the numbers for last year, the top companies' profits were three times more than they spent on research. This is not about research. We all are for research and, as my friend from North Dakota indicated, we as taxpayers fund research. This year we will contribute over $23 billion to basic research. I support that. I support doing more than that. It is an important investment. After we do that, the companies take the basic information and see if they can develop new lifesaving medicine. That is great. However, we give tax deductions for research, as well as advertising and other costs of doing business. When they get to the point where they actually have a new drug, we give them a patent of up to 20 years to protect their competitive edge, their brand name, so they can recover their research costs. We know it costs a lot of money to develop a lifesaving drug. We want to make sure it is a good investment and they can recover their costs. The problem is, we get done with all of this and what do we have? The highest prices in the world--higher than anyone else. If you are uninsured and using medications--which is primarily the seniors of this country--and you walk into your pharmacy, you get the great pleasure and honor of paying the absolutely highest prices in the world. That is outrageous. That is what we are trying to fix, both by making sure the health care system works with medications through Medicare, and also making sure that we have greater competition, that we address the outrageous spiraling prices and we can bring those down for everyone. That is the point of the debate. We made some progress through amendments last week on cost containment. Yesterday we had an important debate on Medicare coverage. The question now is whether or not we will be able to get this done on behalf of the American people. I am hopeful we will be able to do that.

Everything I have heard has been correct. The fact that the other side of this debate is right when they argue that the Supreme Court has upheld the right of a woman to have an abortion is only half of the constitutional law on this subject. We, on this side, accept the fact of the constitutional law of the right of a woman to an abortion. We hope that the other side will accept another fact of constitutional law. That is, the Supreme Court's decision that taxpayers do not have to pay for abortions. This is also the law of the land. I am here to defend it. Now, there is no question but in this case that we are talking about during this debate, the case of Federal employees' health insurance, there is no question that the taxpayers are subsidizing it. It is a fact of our budget that approximately 72 percent of the Federal employees' health care is paid for by their employer, the Federal Government. I suppose the public is surprised that it is not 100 percent paid by the taxpayers, because I often hear that Federal employees have free health insurance. No, it is like any other employee; a certain percentage is paid by the employer and a certain percentage is paid by the employee. Here, it is 72 percent. A big portion of the premium is paid for by the taxpayers. The taxpayers have an interest in this debate. The taxpayers have an interest in this debate because the Supreme Court defines the Constitution that when it comes to abortion, the taxpayers do not have to pay for abortions. The taxpayers can pay for abortions if the law says so, but there is not a constitutional right to have the taxpayers pay for your abortion. Now, there are other unsubstantiated arguments during this debate, as well. Another is that most private plans provide for abortions. This just is not the case. I checked with the Congressional Research Service on this because some people just keep bringing up and repeating this unproved point, a point I believe put out by the Guttmacher Institute. Of course, we all know, Mr. President, the objective of the Guttmacher Institute. That institute used to be directly associated with abortion providers.

I concur in his analysis. There will be no unanimous consent request or additional amendments brought up, or anything of that nature. I also agree with him that we should have our colleagues down here discussing this bill, if they desire to do so. I encourage anyone who may be listening, if they have comments on this bill, come to the floor. There will be plenty of time this afternoon for us to continue to engage in this discussion. It is a very important discussion. I think with regard to the several points of disagreement that we have, we should keep in mind the points of agreement we do have. I think, for example, all concerned agree that we need to bring many of these agencies that have to do with homeland security under one umbrella and that we must do it in a much better and more efficient way than we have carried out the operations of Government in many other respects. So let's build on that. I hope we can build on that and address the points of disagreement and see if we cannot come together. I am still hopeful that in the waning days in which we have to address this issue, we will be able to come together and agree on not only the principle I just enunciated with regard to the merger, but also with regard to issues concerning the President's proper authority and appropriate flexibility that is going to be needed to manage this gargantuan enterprise we are setting out on. It is really a major endeavor. Nothing has been done like this in several decades in this country, and we are going to need all hands on deck, all the tools, all the resources, and all of the attention that we can bring to bear on this problem in order to make this country safer. I think most of us realize now that we will probably never again be able to believe we are totally safe and that we can cover every border and every bolt and every automobile and every airplane, all to the extent that we will have a failsafe situation and that we will not need to constantly keep our guard up. There is a lot we can do. A lot has already been done. The President has taken charge and Tom Ridge in the Office of Homeland Security has taken charge. They have issued Executive orders that have addressed many of the burning issues that we face. I think our border situation is already better. Our transportation situation is better. But there is an awful lot to be done before we get to the point where we can say that we have done all that we can do. It is a very difficult proposition. I said last week that one of the things that impresses me most about this body, about the Government in general, is how difficult it is to make any really substantive change to anything. If there is any difficulty connected with it at all, if it comes to spending money, or something like that, we can usually come together because it benefits those of us who are spending the money, benefits our constituents, and we get some short-term benefit from that all the way around. We sometimes pay long-term consequences for it, but spending money seems to be an easy thing to do. Here, we are actually stepping on some people's toes and we are acknowledging some dysfunctional aspects of our Government and we are saying, let's change that. But there are a lot of vested interests out there who don't want to change. They want the status quo. In the abstract, they want the same end result we do--we want a better system--but they don't want to change things in order to achieve a better system. We have been looking, listening, watching, and absorbing for many years in this Congress and in this Senate the various negative aspects of many of the agencies of our Government and how they are not working, how they are not doing what they are supposed to be doing, how they are rife with waste, fraud, and abuse, and billions of dollars are being sent out for things--like people who are deceased, for example. We find that we cannot incorporate high-tech information systems that have been incorporated in the private sector for years and years, to good effect. We cannot seem to bring that into the Government. The IRS has wasted billions and billions of dollars trying to get their computers to talk to each other. They are making real progress now, but for a long time they did not. And there are human resources problems, human capital problems. We are losing people we ought to be keeping in Government, and too often keeping the people we ought to be losing because of old rules and regulations that were set up decades ago. We have seen all of this happen, all of this evolve as Government got bigger and bigger and more complex, with levels and upper levels--every Deputy Assistant Secretary has an assistant to the Deputy Assistant Secretary, and they have two, three, and four, and it keeps growing. It makes us less efficient and less responsive to the people we are supposed to be serving. Now, we understand it is not just money and inefficiency and lack of service we have to be concerned about. We have to be concerned about our very safety--the No. 1 job of Government, self-protection. Yet there are those who want to incorporate that system, this bureaucratic mess that has evolved into the new Homeland Security Department because they do not want to make any changes. Unfortunately, a part of what has to be addressed. Governmentwide is our civil service system. No one wants to deal with that because it is politically difficult, politically volatile, and you are going to be stepping on some people's toes. Yet there is unanimity among Democratic and Republican experts who have looked at this problem and have experienced this problem. In the homeland security bill, we are trying to solve a Governmentwide problem. It is much too big. It is much too politically difficult. There are too many entrenched interests to successfully address that situation. We are trying to say, with regard to homeland security, with the issue most important to our country: Let's have a little flexibility in these civil service rules that we have not had in times past. When President Carter asked for civil service reforms in the spring of 1978, he said the system ``had become a bureaucratic maze which neglects merit, tolerates poor performance, permits abuse of legitimate employee rights, and mires every personnel action in redtape, delay, and confusion.'' That was President Carter. Accordingly, Congress delivered the requested reforms in the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. But a lot has happened since 1978 to prove that we still have a long ways to go. The Brookings Institution report of 2002 quoted earlier now says: That is the Brookings Institution's analysis of our civil service system. This is not news to anybody. President Carter knew about it, spoke on it, and the Brookings Institution and others have spoken about it. We heard testimony in the Governmental Affairs Committee over the years about this issue. Something has to be done about it, and everybody wrings their hands and acknowledges it is not right that it takes 5 or 6 months to hire somebody. It is not right that it takes 18 months to fire a poor performer. But that is the way it is, and that is the way we have been doing business. We rock along tolerating that kind of a system because it is only Government and we really do not expect much out of Government anyway, do we? Now we are in a different world, and we understand that what is at stake is not just aggravation or waiting in a longer line or putting some civil service employees out who are trying to get a job or trying to get promotion inside a system that only let's them move lockstep or waste a few billion dollars--it is not just that anymore. It is our very safety and survival as a nation because, if we adopt this kind of system into the Department of Homeland Security, we will get the same results as other agencies. We will see not only waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement, overlap and duplication, but we will see the border not protected the way it should be, airline safety not being what it should be, cargoes will not be examined the way they should be, the information technology we need to tie all this together so we can keep up with the bad guys will not be what it should be because we have seen it has not worked in any other aspect of Government. What makes us think that just by creating this new Department under the same old rules it will work any better in this new Department of Government? If anything, there will be new problems that will be created from this new Department of Government because we are talking about bringing together over 170,000 Federal employees. It will require the coordination of 17 different unions, 77 existing collective bargaining agreements, 7 different payroll systems, 80 different personnel management systems--80--an overwhelming task by any stretch of the imagination. Again, with this more complex, more difficult, and more-important- than-ever task that we have on our plate now, do we really want to bring the old way of doing business into our Government that has produced these bad results? The answer is no. We have to do business a little differently. We have to give the President authority that other Presidents have had--not take away his authority as the opposition to this bill would do, or diminish his authority, or set up new requirements for the President to prove. It means that we have to give the people who are going to be running this new Department some flexibility with regard to hiring, firing, promoting, rewarding, holding employees accountable--all those issues we should have done Governmentwide years ago and we do not have the political will to do. At long last, with regard to the Department of Homeland Security, at least we ought to acknowledge that we have to look at these issues differently. We have done so with regard to several Departments. That is the irony.

No. 2, I want to talk briefly about gasoline prices, something that all of Washington talks about but no one actually does anything about. By passing the pending amendment, by repealing the 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline, we can bring the price of gasoline down by about $1 a tank whenever you fill up your car, your truck, or your van. Historically, Government has understood that gasoline taxes are inherently discriminatory since the level of gasoline usage varies greatly depending on where you live. The average resident of a State like Texas spends almost twice as much money on gasoline as the average resident of a State like New York. People who live in rural areas, by the very nature of their living in rural areas, travel great distances and use a lot of gasoline and diesel in their cars and trucks. As a result, government has concluded that taxing gasoline as a source of general revenue is inherently discriminatory. It discriminates against people who live in rural areas as compared to urban areas, it discriminates against people who have to travel great distances to work, and it discriminates against people who live in the Western part of the country where you have more open spaces and people generally drive more. To try to deal with the inherently unfair nature of a gasoline tax as a source of general revenue, what we have normally done is to dedicate the gasoline tax to pay for roads and bridges. Since the 1950's, it has in essence become a user fee: the people who use the roads the most pay the most gasoline taxes, and they are the largest beneficiaries. Before we adopted the Clinton gas tax, we had never, since we started the highway trust fund, imposed a permanent gasoline tax that was not dedicated to highway building. The Clinton gas tax is unique in that it is a permanent tax on gasoline where the money goes not to road building, so that the people who are paying the taxes are the principal beneficiaries, but instead goes to the general revenue. In fact, if you look at the Clinton budget since 1993, you will see that the money basically goes to social programs and social welfare. In 1993, through the Clinton gasoline tax, we imposed a new general tax on gasoline-- paid for by people who have to drive their cars and their trucks great distances to earn a living--in order to pay for benefits going to people who by and large do not work. We, therefore, created through this gasoline tax an incredible redistribution of income and wealth--the Clinton gasoline tax imposed a new burden on people who drive to work for a living in order to subsidize people who by and large do not go to work. We have an opportunity in the pending amendment to solve this problem by repealing this gasoline tax thereby eliminating this burden on people that have to drive their cars and trucks great distances to earn a living. In my State, it is not uncommon for someone to live 40 miles from where they work and, as a result, a gasoline tax imposes a very heavy burden on them. We have an opportunity to eliminate that inequity by repealing the 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline, a permanent gas tax that, for the first time ever, went into general revenues to fund social programs instead of paying for highway construction. Now, everybody is talking about rising gasoline prices--the President has asked for an investigation by the Justice Department and we are holding hearings all over Capitol Hill. Yet, we all know one thing for certain: if we really want to lower the price of gasoline this week, there is only one thing that we can do--repeal the Clinton gasoline tax. If we repeal the gasoline tax today in the Senate, if the House passed it tomorrow, and if the President signed it on Thursday, on Friday morning every filling station in America would lower their posted price by 4.3 cents a gallon and everybody in America who fills up their car, their truck, or their van with gasoline would save about $1 a tank. This is something that we can do, it is something that we have the power to do, but the question is: Do we have the will to do it? I would like to remind my colleagues, and I would like to remind anybody who is listening, that I offered the amendment to repeal the Clinton gasoline tax 19 days ago. My effort to offer that amendment was stopped by the Democratic leadership in the Senate who decided not to allow this amendment to come up for a vote. The President now says he would sign the bill repealing his gasoline tax and our Democratic colleagues in the Senate say that they too are for it. My guess is, if we had a vote today, 80 Members of the Senate would vote to repeal this gasoline tax. Yet, for 19 days we have denied lower gas prices to the American people. We have denied the equity that would come from repealing this gasoline tax which, for the first time since the creation of the highway trust fund, taxes people who drive their cars and trucks to work in order to subsidize welfare for people who do not work. For 19 days, despite the fact that almost everybody agrees this is something we should do, we have not done it. Unless some kind of an agreement is worked out, at 2:15 p.m. today we are going to vote on breaking the Democratic filibuster of the gasoline tax repeal amendment. If you want to repeal the gasoline tax, then you should vote to end debate and let us have a vote on actually repealing the gasoline tax. I hope the American people will make note of how individual Senators vote, and will remember that people who want to repeal the gasoline tax are going to vote to end the debate. After 19 days of stalling, after 19 days of perpetuating an inequitable tax, after 19 days of artificially holding up gasoline prices, I hope our Democratic colleagues in the Senate are ready to let this Senate do its will.

Senators Warner, Graham and I wrote and supported the bill that was reported out of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Over the past 2 weeks, however, we have been involved in negotiations with the White House and the House of Representatives and reached a compromise. The compromise legislation, which I support, does not redefine the Geneva Conventions in any way. It amends the War Crimes Act--which currently says only that a violation of Common Article 3 is a war crime--by enumerating nine categories of offenses that constitute ``grave breaches of Common Article 3'' and thus are war crimes, punishable by imprisonment or death. The bill authorizes the President to interpret the Geneva Conventions--a power he has already under the Constitution--as to what constitute nongrave breaches. These interpretations must be published in the Federal Register, and they will have same force as other administrative regulations, and thus may be trumped by law passed by Congress. I am pleased with the agreement that we have reached with the administration and I support this legislation in the form pending on the floor.

First, the chairman of the committee, the Senator from Hawaii, said we have funded many space programs, and he mentioned the Space Tracking and Surveillance System and Space Situational Awareness Programs. That is true, except that they cut $55 million out of the STSS Program. The key point is that those are situational awareness and tracking programs, not defensive programs. There is zero in here for the defense space test research program. That is what I am talking about--not situational awareness and tracking but an actual Defense research program. Secondly, the Senator from North Dakota first responded to my argument and the fact that I had quoted General Obering's support by saying he is not surprised that the Kyl amendment is supported by a general, that they usually are because their careers depend upon programs. Frankly, I am astounded by this ad hominem attack. Let's attack the substance of the program, not the general who supports it. We cannot trust our generals? Is that what is being said? We ask them to devise ways of protecting us from attack, and that is the thanks they get. Let's turn to the substance of the argument. Two primary points were made by the Senator from North Dakota. First of all, because the space- based test bed program could evolve into a space-based missile defense, regardless of its other benefits for satellite protection, we should not fund the program. Well, my first reaction is, God forbid that we would develop a program to defend us from intercontinental ballistic missiles. We would not want to do that. Of course, the point is there are years of decisionmaking between the time that a space-based test bed program evolves into concepts and potential programs and the research evolves into specific proposals and the time that the Senate would ever vote on them. Does the Senator have such a lack of confidence in his ability to stop such a horrible thing--space-based defenses--that he is not even willing to allow a program to be funded to develop conceptual programs to defend our satellites in space, which presumably we all favor? Finally, the last argument was, well, the nations of the world would be better to get together and have an agreement not to develop weapons in space. There are two answers to that. First of all, what is a Chinese missile flying through space to hit a satellite called? That is what they did. As the Senator from Florida and I discussed the other day, that they left a lot of space debris is a problem in the wake of that attack. What is a missile flying through space to hit another country's satellite called? Is that a weapon in space? Are we so afraid of defending our satellite assets that we don't want to defend against a satellite killer missile from a country coming up from the ground into space that hits our satellite? Would we not want to defend it from space? That is a ludicrous argument. I don't believe we are going to get the countries of the world together to join in a treaty to have them forget programs that they have already been developing--the Chinese in this particular case--because they want to have an asymmetric way of destroying our satellites. The bottom line is this: The United States better get serious about defending our eyes and ears in space and now the satellites that direct so much of our military activity. Other countries have the ability to turn off the light. They know where the switch is. In times of war, we cannot be blind and deaf and be denied our space assets. And yet virtually by turning off the switch, other countries have that capability. Isn't it about time we begin the first steps of developing a capability against that? I note, by the way, that the $10 million program out of a budget for missile defense of over $8 billion is hardly enough to color general Obering's claims that this would be a good program for us to begin research on. I hope my colleagues, when this amendment is voted on, will think about the future, will think about the fact that they have plenty of opportunities to stop a program should it ever evolve into a space- based missile defense program. If they want to stop that, stop that, but don't use that as an argument to stop research on a satellite protection program.","word.count":765,"sep11":6.21629213483146,"years":2008.07584269663,"days":4655,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.011177460864986,"Topic 2":0.0572371321420091,"Topic 3":0.00858788461894054,"Topic 4":0.00478009444336928,"Topic 5":0.245163773343494,"Topic 6":0.0123378581658227,"Topic 7":0.0129168162499216,"Topic 8":0.461742408243003,"Topic 9":0.120510045060747,"Topic 10":0.0655465268677066},{"id":"10519970031627","body":"Mark Foley: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support swift passage of H.R. 3824 so that it may be sent immediately to the President and enacted into law before the October 25th implementation date for the Fastener Quality Act regulations. As chairwoman of the Technology Subcommittee which has held a hearing to examine the Fastener Quality Act and Aviation Manufacturing, I can report that there is consensus among the aviation industry, FAA and NIST that a federal quality assurance process already exists to certify the quality and safety of proprietary fasteners manufactured or altered specifically for use by aviation manufacturers. Adding another set of federal regulations and involving another federal agency in that process would hinder the efficiency of aviation manufacturing and add to the costs of production, while potentially degrading the level of safety currently provided by the FAA. In addition to addressing issues raised about the Fastener Quality Act's impact on the aviation industry, I am pleased H.R. 3824 also includes an amendment that I offered during the Science Committee's mark-up of the legislation to delay the implementation of the Fastener Quality Act's regulations on all other industries until no earlier than June of 1999. The extra time will allow Congress to review the industries affected by the Fastener Quality Act and determine what changes to the Act may be needed. Without the delay in implementation of the regulations, several industries--including the automotive manufacturing industry--may suffer production delays that will impede product delivery and increase costs. As we all know, increases in production costs result in job-layoffs and higher prices charged to consumers. As Chairman Sensenbrenner mentioned, the Technology Subcommittee plans to hold another hearing on this subject after the August recess. As chairwoman of the Subcommittee, I will continue to work with NIST, the automotive manufacturers and other industries impacted by the Fastener Quality Act to avoid promulgating costly regulations which are unnecessarily burdensome. I would like to thank Chairman Sensenbrenner and Technology Ranking Member Barcia for their important work on this critical measure. I urge all my colleagues to support this important legislation.","word.count":104,"sep11":-4.07022471910112,"years":1997.7893258427,"days":993,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.213636003008996,"Topic 2":0.067791028728349,"Topic 3":0.0164591880704589,"Topic 4":0.0207088816465874,"Topic 5":0.00659733943517974,"Topic 6":0.144870932375848,"Topic 7":0.0216884694409701,"Topic 8":0.0328364966735993,"Topic 9":0.46957962491889,"Topic 10":0.00583203570112106},{"id":"10619990034137","body":"Larry Combest: Mr. Speaker, while I will not oppose H.R. 4389, I will note that this project transfer bill does not in my view represent good stewardship of a valuable Federal asset. The bill is full of generalities, and the United States and taxpayer-owners get practically nothing out of this deal. No environmental benefits will result from this transfer, and public involvement opportunities are minimal. My formal views on H.R. 4389 are set forth in the Committee Report accompanying the bill. The bill mandates conveyance without first allowing the Secretary to determine whether such a conveyance is in the public interest. The bill should, instead simply authorize the conveyance so the Secretary can make such a determination. The bill does not provide for local public involvement prior to final action on the transfer. The bill fails to provide for environmental protection and enhancement. Environmental protection and enhancement are the appropriate quid pro quo to mitigate for post-transfer loss of federal control and applicability of most federal laws. Finally, H.R. 4389 creates a fixed ``sale price'' prior to knowing the details of the transfer. The United States should negotiate a fair price for the conveyance only after the terms and conditions of transfer are established through negotiations with local stakeholders. Transfers of Western water projects to local beneficiaries are not inherently bad, but H.R. 4389 should not be used as a template for future transfers.

They spoke of a 2-week conference that has just ended--actually, more than a conference, a gathering of nations--in Vienna, Austria, to reach agreement on ways to stop the killing and maiming of civilians by these indiscriminate weapons. At that conference in Vienna, officials from governments from around the world, including our own, made speeches about how terrible landmines are. Many of them spoke of the fact that there are 100 million unexploded landmines in over 60 countries, and every day, every 22 minutes, somebody--often a child--is killed or maimed by these landmines. That is 72 people every day of every week of the year. They went on to say how much they all wanted to get rid of them, but. They each had an exception or loophole so their landmines, or their manner of using them, would not be affected. President Clinton gave a stirring speech at the United Nations last year, where he called for the eventual elimination of antipersonnel landmines. That was an historic milestone. But in Vienna last week, the United States lagged behind several countries, including several of our NATO allies. While Belgium outlawed landmines and Austria renounced their use and France announced that it would no longer produce them, the United States continued to resist these kinds of dramatic steps. At least the U.S. Senate, a body that can and should be the conscience of the Nation, voted by a two-thirds majority to impose a 1- year moratorium on the use of antipersonnel landmines and to continue our moratorium on the export of landmines. We here in the U.S. Senate took a leadership position that has been applauded around the world. Editorials around the world have said how far reaching we were. A number of countries have even gone farther. Why did Belgium, a country that sends people for peacekeeping missions all the time, ban the use of antipersonnel landmines by its own forces? Because when Belgium sends peacekeepers, even after the fighting has stopped and the guns have been withdrawn, there is one killer that remains behind--the millions of antipersonnel landmines, each one waiting for a peacekeeper or a nurse or a missionary to step on a pile of leaves or some grass or a road or walk by a watering hole and suddenly lose their leg or their arm or their life. The same happens when a child picks up a shiny object thinking it is a toy and loses his or her hands or face or eyes or life. That happens every few minutes in the 60-odd countries that are infested with unexploded landmines. Mr. President, much could be done if the United States had the courage to adopt as its official policy the moratorium passed by the U.S. Senate, Republicans and Democrats, some of the most conservative and some of the most liberal. It was a vote that spanned the political spectrum. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer who voted for that. It is no denigration of any of us that we have differences in political philosophy. We come from different parts of the country and different parties. But we approach this issue with the same humanitarian sense. This is not a Republican issue or a Democratic issue. The distinguished Presiding Officer knows from his past experience in the past administration--he knows how volunteers from this country, carrying out the highest ideals of this country, volunteers in the Peace Corps, go to countries like Ethiopia, and Nicaragua, and perhaps even Bosnia someday. What is one of the biggest dangers they face? It is not malaria, it is not dysentery, although those diseases are there. It is that when they go into a village to help somebody plant a new variety of corn or wheat or help build an irrigation system or teach a group of children how to play baseball, they may not come back alive because of landmines, probably left there by people who were fighting years ago. But the landmines remain. I hope our country will take more of a lead, that we will start catching up with some of our NATO allies and others who have experienced firsthand the devastation these insidious weapons cause. I expect we are going to send troops to Bosnia, to fulfill our commitments to NATO. At a meeting of the bipartisan congressional leadership with the President and his Cabinet the other day I said, ``If we do send Americans into Bosnia, into the former Yugoslavia, Mr. President, I hope you will do one thing. I hope you will tell the American people that this is not a risk-free operation. That even if there is a cease-fire, even if there is a cease-fire that holds, the men and women we send in there will face one very grave danger--from landmines. Some estimate over 1.5 million landmines are strewn in Bosnia alone.'' I learned today that there are another 2 million in Croatia. We need to tell the American people that their sons and daughters may not be shot by one of the warring sides in the former Yugoslavia, but they may be injured or killed tragically by a landmine left behind. And it is quite possible we will not even know which side put it there. These are the Saturday night specials of civil wars and guerrilla warfare. So, I applaud those who came together today to renew a national debate on banning landmines. I thank my colleagues here in the Senate who joined to vote for a moratorium on their use. I commend the President for the position he has taken, as far as it has gone. I commend the Secretary of State, UN Ambassador Albright and others who have also, but I urge the administration to redouble its efforts. Only strong leadership, by the world's only superpower, will suffice.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. Mr. Chairman, this kind of simple prohibition simply is unworkable and takes the thought processes out of setting priorities and making determinations about different values, about different emergencies, about different situations. The fact of the matter is very often we buy some private property to relieve pressure on other private property owners. We know that a number of endangered species problems have been solved because the Federal Government was able to aggregate some areas for protection that then freed up other landowners so that they could put their lands to the productive use or the changes or whatever that they wanted to participate in. So now we would say, no, they cannot do that. We know very often that we buy property sometimes because it threatens the values and the purposes of the national preserve, whether it is a park or whether it is the forest. We buy some lands so that we can then swap those lands for some other lands that private property or a city or a county wants to put to use. They want us to buy certain lands and swap different lands with them. Those are all determinations made by elected officials at local levels and in the Congress and in the Senate and city council members. They use their judgment. Yes, there is a backlog. But let us not pretend like this Congress has been working it off recently, because the Congress has not funded that. But we should not take away those kinds of determinations. Under this thinking, what they would say is that they could not build three fighter planes at the same time or they could not build a new class of submarine until they finished the old one. No, we have different situations that emerge in the running of this Government; and the fact of the matter is that we make determinations and we use our best judgments. And so, now they want to say that they can only use this money for inholdings. But, in fact, if an emergency comes up or they have to protect a Federal asset, then they have to go through a lot of rigmarole. The fact is that this system has worked very, very well. Because we have purchased inholdings. We have purchased lands contiguous to these lands where we think they have a particular value or in some cases where landowners want out because they want to do something to the land, they want to go into some other business and the Federal Reserve is inconsistent with that. These people use it. They do not run around willy-nilly. Most of these purchases from the Land and Water Conservation Fund are made because Members of Congress go to the Committee on Appropriations and ask that they be made. Every year we trudge down there, we send letters, we get all the people in our delegation to sign them. And they come from both sides of the aisle, and they come from most of the Members who have spoken here tonight asking for the Federal Government to buy these lands. And they want to posture and put a straitjacket on these Federal agencies so they cannot provide the kind of stewardship that the Nation's lands deserve.

I see no indication that they are willing to restore the funding the President has asked so that we do not have to lay off 40,000 teachers. The problem is that every week that they continue with this ``government on the installment plan'' they push local school districts further and further to the point where they have to lay off teachers. We do not want that done. We want them to get down to the business now, deal with the regular long-term CR rather than continuing this ``let's pretend'' extension of the Government under which you are continuously week by week squeezing the guts out of education and squeezing the guts out of our ability to enforce the law when it comes to environmental cleanup.

South Texas also would like to thank the gentleman from Utah and the gentleman from West Virginia for their attention to our situation and understanding, and their willingness to move this urgent bill forward. I also want to thank the staff. We had an opportunity to travel to my district, and we had hearings. The South Texan who deserves great credit for House consideration today is the gentleman from Texas , our distinguished appropriations cardinal whose personal involvement in this legislation has been pivotal to our success today. The gentleman from Texas and I co-chair the House Border Caucus, and he is an important player for all of us when it comes to issues affecting the southwest border. Mr. Speaker, nature, or El Nino or La Nina, has played a cruel joke on Texas. After a decade of drought in South Texas, Mother Nature dumped between 30 and 40 inches of rain on central Texas which caused a lot of flooding and a lot of damage, none of which made its way to our reservoirs in South Texas. The Lower Rio Grande Valley Water Conservation and Improvement Act of 2001 will authorize $47 million to be managed by the State of Texas to improve the irrigation system in the South Texas area. The bill specifies water transportation and conservation activities. It also begins to implement some of the water conservation measures considered in the development of the State of Texas water plan. We have been hit hard by at least 6 years of drought, and have raced to find ways to conserve this amount of water. We have to save as much as we can. This bill is an outgrowth of a very serious international treaty violation by Mexico. In 1944, the United States and Mexico signed a water treaty to share the waters of the Rio Grande, the Colorado, and their tributaries. Under the treaty, the United States delivers 1.5 million acre-feet of water to Mexico from the Colorado while Mexico delivers 350,000 acre- feet of water to the United States from tributaries and reservoirs of the Rio Grande. I represent the Texas border communities at the downstream of the river. The last drop and the last stop of water is in my district. There is very little that we can do to help south Texas water users today. But passing this bill to authorize improvements to the existing irrigation systems in the area will help conserve the tiny bit of water that we do now have. The gentleman from California led the Committee on Resources in a hearing in south Texas. He saw and heard firsthand the need that we have to improve the existing infrastructure in south Texas. Californians, and others from the American Southwest, have a special understanding of water needs and droughts; and we will be standing together with our colleagues from California as we try to mitigate the circumstances we now find ourselves in. I and all south Texas water users are deeply grateful to all the players in the House who have heard our plea for help and have stepped up to the plate to do what we need to do to make this horrible situation a little better. I want to thank my good friend, the gentlewoman for Wyoming, for being a lot of help in contributing to the passage of this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas .","word.count":610,"sep11":0.882022471910112,"years":2002.74157303371,"days":2756,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.187002010563572,"Topic 2":0.180233877461183,"Topic 3":0.0258870271241162,"Topic 4":0.380448804797757,"Topic 5":0.0167733946507108,"Topic 6":0.00625663647054715,"Topic 7":0.0798155258769675,"Topic 8":0.078160555183358,"Topic 9":0.0357380781604435,"Topic 10":0.00968408971134476},{"id":"10519980053143","body":"Mike DeWine: Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Child Health Care Quality Research Improvement Act. We have been hearing a great deal recently about the quality of health care in this country. Most of the debate, both here in Congress and back home in our States, has been driven, at least in part, by a fear among consumers that efforts to control costs and move people into managed care has compromised quality. This fear has driven legislation such as the bill we passed just last year to provide for 48-hour maternity stays. This year a whole host of health care quality bills have been introduced in the Congress. Even more such legislation has been moving forward at the State level as well. As I have learned more and more about the concerns about the quality of health care, I have tried to focus particular attention on children, how their health care is delivered and whether its quality has been compromised. Frankly, I have learned something that I find very interesting. While the drive to improve quality and reduce cost has driven a great deal of new research over the past several years, relatively little has been done for children in this area. While we are getting better at measuring quality of health care for adults, we have made little such progress for our children. Between 1993 and 1995, only some 5 percent of the health services research study outcomes focused on our children. This is highly alarming because I frankly cannot think of anything more critical to our Nation's future than the quality of our children's health. Clearly we need to correct this serious lack of good health care quality measures. I have spoken with experts in the field of pediatric research and they agree with this assessment. They tell me that we have to do more in this field if we expect to improve the care that our children receive. Many times, frankly, we don't know exactly which treatments are cost effective or best improve a child's quality of life. We don't know how to manage children's complicated health problems in ways that will allow them to lead normal lives We can answer many of these questions if the patient is an adult, but we have far fewer answers for our children. Here is one example. One study recently found that children have three times greater chance of dying after heart surgery at some hospitals than they have at other hospitals--three times. We must fix this. That means we have to find out why, why one hospital loses three times as many children as another. As both a parent and a grandparent, I can speak from firsthand experience about the stress and the uncertainty that goes along with any childhood illness. To think that a parent's choice of a hospital could actually be harmful to a child is certainly a very scary thought for a parent. Another example is asthma. Asthma is the most common chronic health condition in children, affecting 5 million children in this country, and that percentage, tragically, is rising. We are not sure why this has been happening, but we do know that the quality of health care a child receives can dramatically affect the severity of his or her asthma. As a result, the better the quality of health care, the less time that child spends in the hospital, the fewer visits to the emergency room, and the less time a child has to miss from school. If we do not even know what kinds of treatment work best for children or that different treatments work better in different environments, we cannot help. We certainly can't begin to debate how to improve quality if we can't even define it or measure it. For that, we need to conduct research in real world settings. As a means of getting this research into real world settings and improving the quality of health care that our children receive, I am introducing a bill today entitled the Child Health Care Quality Research Improvement Act. This legislation was developed with the help of leaders in the pediatric community, child advocates, and health services researchers. My bill takes a three-pronged approach to address this issue: One, focusing on training; two, research; and three, data collection for child health outcomes and effectiveness research. Let me start with the first one. In order for us to make advances in the study of pediatric health outcomes, it is essential that we have researchers who have received training in this field. This bill I am introducing today promotes research training programs in child health services research at the doctoral, post-doctoral, and junior faculty levels. By bringing professionals into this very important field, we can ensure that issues that affect the lives of children are receiving the attention they deserve. The second component of this bill establishes research centers and networks. The goal of the centers and networks will be to foster collaboration among experts in the field of pediatric health care quality and effectiveness. We envision that these centers and networks will bring together pediatric specialists from children's hospitals, physicians in managed care plans, statisticians from schools of public health, and other experts in the field to work together on research projects and to translate these findings into real-world settings where children are receiving health care. Third, and finally, this legislation contains a component that adds supplements to existing national health surveys that are today administered by the National Center for Health Statistics and the Maternal and Child Health Bureau. In addition to not knowing how to measure health care quality in children, other data, like that measuring children's use of health care systems and health care expenditures, are lacking. Adding supplements to existing surveys is a very sensible measure. This bill does not require yet another survey to be administered. Rather, it simply adds questions to existing surveys, to allow us to collect valuable data on children. This is the type of information that we need if we want to look at trends in children's health and what we can do to improve their health. Mr. President, we are all well aware that children have medical conditions and health care needs that are different from those of adults. It doesn't make sense to do health services research for adults and hope that one size fits all--that the things we learn will make sense for children. Federal support for child health quality and effectiveness research is vital to ensure that children are receiving appropriate health care. We owe it to our Nation's children to train health professionals in this important filed, and to support these very important research initiatives. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: S. 1867. A bill to amend chapter 35 of title 44, United States Code, for the purpose of facilitating compliance by small businesses with certain Federal paperwork requirements, and to establish a task force to examine the feasibility of streamlining paperwork requirements applicable to small businesses; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.","word.count":1197,"sep11":-3.55337078651685,"years":1998.30617977528,"days":1177,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.135598009266822,"Topic 2":0.205279109304506,"Topic 3":0.26305156213044,"Topic 4":0.161429737447762,"Topic 5":0.0271868174244706,"Topic 6":0.0128689044444312,"Topic 7":0.00758687891492591,"Topic 8":0.165727342760177,"Topic 9":0.0104775458632711,"Topic 10":0.0107940924431933},{"id":"10619990044885","body":"Daniel Moynihan: Without objection, it is so ordered","word.count":1065,"sep11":-2.71348314606742,"years":1999.14606741573,"days":1476,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.946484588758469,"Topic 2":0.0179089452353806,"Topic 3":0.00367344997745694,"Topic 4":0.00602865418001325,"Topic 5":0.0120241587815039,"Topic 6":0.00314049713454471,"Topic 7":0.00185603565821358,"Topic 8":0.0054954305584685,"Topic 9":0.00196110503052579,"Topic 10":0.0014271346854233},{"id":"10620000014083","body":"Michael Bilirakis: Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2498, the Cardiac Arrest Survival Act of 2000. This bipartisan bill was authorized by my Florida colleague, Congressman Cliff Stearns. It was unanimously approved by the Health and Environment Subcommittee on May 9, and it was reported favorably by the Commerce Committee on May 17. Mr. Speaker, a quarter million Americans die each year due to cardiac arrest. Many of these victims could be saved if portable medical devices called automated external defibrillators or ``AEDs'' were used. AEDs can analyze heart rhythms for abnormalities, and if warranted, deliver a life-saving shock to the heart. Experts estimate that 20,000 to 100,000 lives could be saved annually by greater access to AEDs. H.R. 2498 directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to issue regulations to provide for the placement of AEDs in federal buildings. The bill also establishes protections from civil liability arising from the emergency use of the devices. During committee consideration of the bill, it was amended to give the Secretary of Health and Human Services greater flexibility to update the guidelines over time and greater guidance as to what types of assistance and involvement Congress intends. The amendments also clarified the liability provisions and incorporated standards for AED use and training. The bill before us enjoys the strong support of the American Red Cross and the American Heart Association, as well as many Members on both sides of the aisle. It is rare that a solution to a problem so readily presents itself. We must seize this opportunity to reduce the number of lives tragically lost to cardiac arrest.

I will point out that Democrats do not claim to be the sole source of genius and wisdom in America. Republicans have great ideas too, and they did in the 9/11 Commission, chaired by ex-Senator Kean of New Jersey, a Republican. He was one of the co-chairs of the commission. A group of Republicans and a group of Democrats got together and did an evaluation on what this country really needs to do. And they have since then, they have made their recommendations, have issued this score card to evaluate the administration's performance to see whether those bipartisan recommendations have been implemented. And if it was your son or daughter's score card, the kid would not be going to any movies or watching any television, because it was full of Ds and Fs. The most amazing part that is important, I represent the area in Seattle, we have a huge port. And when I tell people that despite this bipartisan Republican and Democrat recommendation to do screening of all of our containers coming in, of radiological materials, either a dirty bomb, the makings of a dirty bomb, or worst case scenario, a fission bomb coming in through our containers, and we know the proliferation that has gone on in the last few years, when you report to people that despite that foreknowledge, the administration can only tell us a tiny little percentage of those are screened for radiological material, that is a sorry state of affairs. And there is no excuse for that failure. We have had a bipartisan consensus, at least on the commission, to get that job done. And the job simply has not been done. And the administration has had its eye off the ball of this major league threat. This is the big threat, by the way, at least in my estimation, and I think of the 9/11 Commission, of a dirty bomb or some day a fission product coming into this country. That is the real threat. By the way, it is probably 1,000 times more likely to be delivered in a container coming through Los Angeles or Seattle or Boston or Gulfport, than coming in from 10 miles up in space in an ICBM that none of these countries have, at least at the moment. That is where the real threat is. But, instead, the administration has been off spending billions of dollars on the Star Wars Project, and refuses to do more than 3 or 4 percent of the containers, which is a known threat, which is a known vector of radiological material; and they refuse to act. That is unconscionable. We Democrats intend to implement a bipartisan approach to this, which is what was in this 9/11 Commission. And people can look it up. It is on the Internet. You can look at the report card. You know, I thought, I was hopeful after that report card came out that the President would get his Cabinet together and hold that report card and say, what is going on here? This is absurd. I am President of the United States, the most powerful Nation in the world, and we are getting Fs on securing our ports, when we have got the technology to do this. I thought that he would do that. Instead, you know what he did? He walked around handing out Medals of Freedom to Paul Wolfowitz who got every decision you could possibly imagine wrong on Iraq. He told his homeland security people they are doing a great job, when 95 percent of the cargo is not screened coming into our ports. That is not a heck of a job. And he has failed to respond to that report from this again bipartisan commission in any way that I can fashion. That is one of the reasons Congress needs to act. There is a reason the framers set up a couple branches of government, so that when one branch was not doing the job, which right now is the executive, Congress can act.","word.count":676,"sep11":4.74438202247191,"years":2006.60393258427,"days":4131,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0996588978778384,"Topic 2":0.50502311317853,"Topic 3":0.0442717986459724,"Topic 4":0.0367029450329697,"Topic 5":0.0432377626778416,"Topic 6":0.114934756469347,"Topic 7":0.026707395437251,"Topic 8":0.0782751279798218,"Topic 9":0.0172308508386166,"Topic 10":0.0339573518618106},{"id":"10419960007494","body":"Robert K. Dornan: Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the manager's amendment and urge my colleagues to vote in favor of its passage. This amendment is particularly important to States such as my California, which are heavily impacted by criminal aliens. Although it is the responsibility of the Federal Government to enforce immigration policy, State and local governments incur significant costs relating to the incarceration of criminal aliens. Unfortunately, many local governments heavily impacted by criminal aliens are not, as the 1994 crime bill intended, being financially compensated for these costs. In trying to meet the public safety needs of the community, these local communities are therefore being forced to bear this financial burden on their own. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased, with the support of my colleagues, the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Smith] and the gentleman from California [Mr. Gallegly], who worked so hard on this excellent bill. My provision has been included in this amendment to clarify the intent of the 1994 crime bill. It would simply ensure that all local governments have the opportunity to apply for the financial compensation they are entitled to for costs associated with incarcerating criminal aliens. I also strongly support a provision in the amendment that would authorize a pilot project by the INS to identify illegal aliens among those incarcerated by the city of Anaheim and the County of Ventura. Under the proposed pilot program, an INS agent would be stationed in two local government jails to perform front-line documentation and appropriate questioning of criminally charged suspected illegal aliens. By helping to speed up the deportation process, I believe this program has the potential to be a significant benefit to the entire country. I support it strongly. I rise in strong support of the manager's amendment, and urge my colleagues to vote in favor of its passage. There are two provisions in this amendment that I believe are particularly important to States, such as California, which are heavily impacted by criminal aliens. Although it is the responsibility of the Federal Government to enforce immigration policy, State and local governments incur significant costs relating to the incarceration of criminal aliens. And while the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act authorized States to receive Federal reimbursement of criminal alien incarceration costs, it was only recently that local governments received similar treatment. In fact, it was the 1994 crime bill that for the first time allowed so- called political subdivisions of a State to be reimbursed for costs associated with incarcerating criminal aliens. This was a very important gain in having the Federal Government recognize its responsibility for criminal aliens. Unfortunately, many local governments heavily impacted by criminal aliens are not, as the 1994 crime bill intended, being financially compensated for these costs. In trying to meet the public safety needs of their community, these local communities, such as the cities of Santa Ana and Anaheim which are located in my district, are therefore being forced to bear this financial burden on their own. I am pleased that with the support of our colleagues Lamar Smith and Elton Gallegly, who have worked so hard on this bill, a provision has been included in this amendment to clarify the intent of the 1994 crime bill. It would simply ensure that all local governments, including counties, cities, as well as municipalities, have the opportunity to apply for the financial compensation they are entitled to for costs associated with incarcerating criminal aliens. I also strongly support a provision in the amendment that would authorize a pilot project by the Immigration and Naturalization Service to identify illegal aliens among those incarcerated by the city of Anaheim and Ventura. A recent 60-day survey conducted by the Anaheim Police Department, located in my district, found that 35 percent of the inmates sent to the Anaheim City Jail were unable to produce documentation that they were in the country legally. Under the proposed pilot program, an INS agent would be stationed in Anaheim's jail to perform front-line documentation and appropriate questioning of criminally charged suspected illegal aliens. This will enhance the relationship between INS officials and local law enforcement and help speed up the deportation process for criminal aliens. And I believe that, if successful, the program has the potential to be a significant benefit for the entire country.

I rise today to express my concern, and to urge President Bush to proceed with care and prudence. At a minimum: the United States must first exhaust every diplomatic solution that might avoid war, with war seen as a last resort; the United States must assure sufficient international support, similar to the coalition that made the Gulf War viable; and, the administration must fully consult with Congress, which has a significant constitutional obligation in this matter, and receive proper authorization. Let me be clear: There is little question that Iraq poses a grave risk to the United States and our friends and allies. How to deal with Iraq remains, as it has for over a decade, one of the top foreign policy priorities for the United States. At this point we can not and should not lose sight of the fact that we still have considerable work to do in Afghanistan. Rushing precipitously towards another military confrontation, unless the need is imminent, would not be prudent. We are all aware of the nature of the threat: Iraq under Saddam Hussein seeks to develop WMD, has used these weapons against its own people, has invaded its neighbors and threatened others in the region with its missiles. And we are all well aware that Iraq, having agreed to United Nations inspectors after its defeat in the Gulf War a decade ago, banned them in 1998. For 4 years the international community has had no access to Iraq and no ability to inspect its weapons facilities. The administration believes Iraq is continuing to develop chemical and biological weapons, and is seeking nuclear weapons. As a member of the Intelligence Committee I believe that the administration is correct in this assessment. And the administration has argued that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction must be dismantled before President Saddam Hussein forms an alliance with Al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. It is critical, therefore, that the United States, through the United Nations, seek additional inspections, under a ``go anywhere, anytime'' inspection regime, to provide Iraq with the opportunity, one last time, to either work with the international community on this issue or, by its refusal, admit guilt and face the consequences. I also believe that it is critical that, should an imminent threat require U.S. action, that the Administration come to Congress to seek its judgment and assent. The resolution authorizing the use of force against the September 11 attackers provides the President authority to take military action only against those groups, individuals, or nations who aided in the September 11 attacks, or harbored those involved. It states: ``The President is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations, or persons.'' On its face, then, this resolution is both narrow and specific, in that it applies only to the September 11 attacks. In order to take action against Iraq under this resolution, the President must determine both that Iraq has harbored any Al Qaeda members, or anyone else who aided in the September 11 attacks, and that such an attack would ``prevent any future acts of international terrorism,'' as also required by the resolution. On the other hand, if the President attacks Iraq simply to destroy its weapons of mass destruction, which may be a justified action under certain circumstances, this resolution does not provide the authority for such an attack. Iraq's WMD program, if not directly linked to the September 11 attacks, is a separate issue not covered by the September resolution. In such a circumstance the President would need to, must, seek an additional authorizing resolution from Congress. I was pleased to see that Secretary of State Powell has indicated President Bush will fully consult with Congress before any military action is taken against Iraq. It is imperative that we comply with the provisions of the War Powers Resolution, a joint legislative act that will ensure: ``The collective judgment of both Congress and the President will apply to the introduction of United States armed forces into hostilities.'' Given the gravity of placing potentially large numbers of America's forces in harm's way, I think anything less than such a ``collective judgment'' would tarnish the sacred trust our people have in their government. As our colleague Senator Byrd wrote in The New York Times earlier this week: ``The Constitution states that the President shall be commander in chief, but it is Congress that has the constitutional authority to provide for the common defense and general welfare, raise armies, and to declare war. In other words, Congress has a constitutional responsibility to weigh in on war-related policy decisions.'' The challenges in taking action against Iraq underscore the need for the United States to work with our friends and allies in the region and elsewhere if we are to take effective action against Iraq. The administration has made great strides in creating as wide an international coalition as possible for action against terror and terrorists, it must do likewise for any action against Iraq. In contemplating any such action against Iraq, we must consult with allies and build the kind of coalition that supported our efforts in the Gulf War, especially those countries whose peoples and governments are bound to be affected by such an undertaking. We should not take action against Iraq until both we, the American people and our regional partners, are convinced of the reasons for so doing and that there is a clear mission and goal in mind. The United States must also consider carefully the consequences of precipitous action. Can we assure our regional partners that our actions will not involve the de-stabilization of the region? Might unilateral unsupported action against Iraq result in attacks against close allies such as Israel or protests against regional leaders in Egypt, Saudi Arabia or Jordan? Following any military action, are we prepared militarily and financially to remain in the region until Saddam is removed, the people of Iraq are free, and a viable democratic government is in place? These are complex questions to which there may be no easy answers. But they are questions that must be addressed before we take any action if those actions are to be successful and the results, enduring. If this matter is not handled properly, there is a profound risk that the Middle East will be further destabilized, and place U.S. interests in the region and in the war against terrorism in jeopardy. None of us has the wisdom or foresight to see where this war will lead us, how long it will last, or when it will end. But we are all foursquare in our determination that we, and all civilized peoples, succeed. I offer my thoughts and comments today not as a criticism of the administration, but rather because I feel that we have a deep obligation to make sure that as we proceed with this endeavor we do so with thoughtfulness, not afraid to ask the tough questions that must be asked or address the issues that must be addressed, and with the unity of purpose that will guarantee our success.","word.count":1244,"sep11":0.536516853932584,"years":2002.39606741573,"days":2633,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0424676938696528,"Topic 2":0.445765807878625,"Topic 3":0.00319104011882593,"Topic 4":0.383893041806866,"Topic 5":0.00374837488480782,"Topic 6":0.00159091641598484,"Topic 7":0.00354856387782897,"Topic 8":0.00721206072154154,"Topic 9":0.093471909275385,"Topic 10":0.0151105911504822},{"id":"10419960043313","body":"Arlen Specter: Mr. President, I have sought recognition to express my concern about our being out of session for the next considerable period of time in the context of the gridlock and breakdown over the negotiations of the budget. It is my hope that the negotiators will continue the budget negotiations because of the importance of reaching a resolution on those subjects, and that we will not have a recurrence of the shutdown of Government, as we have had twice in the course of the past several weeks, or that there will not be a resort to the debt ceiling issue as an instrument of, candidly speaking, political blackmail--which I think will be unsuccessful. If we are not able to resolve the budget disagreements, that we will at least crystallize the issue and make that the election issue in 1996. I made this point back on November 14, on the second day of the first governmental shutdown. It seemed to me from the start that this was bad policy. From the reaction of the American people, that view was confirmed. That is simply not the way to run the Government of the United States. I think the budget negotiators, however, have worked hard and there has been considerable progress made. I have taken a look, in reviewing the issues, and believe that the negotiators with more work can come to a conclusion. The central point is to have a balanced budget--a matter of enormous importance. There has been an agreement in principle by the Republican-controlled Congress and Republican-controlled White--almost a Freudian slip, to make the Republicans control the White House as well. We have a divided Government, but at least there has been agreement on that principle. There is a substantial question as to whether the balanced budget proposal offered by the administration meets the ``fair'' criterion, since so much of it is deferred until the years 2001 and 2002. But I think there is ample room for negotiation, in order to have a realistic agreement made in those terms. I spoke on this matter to some extent yesterday and wish to amplify it today. One set of figures which bear repeating are the statistics on the narrowing of the gap between the parties on major issues such as Medicare, where the rate of increase is reduced in the conference report passed by the Republican-controlled Congress. Note it is not a cut but rather a reduction of the rate of increase by $270 billion, which has since been reduced to $168 billion. The administration first agreed to $102 billion and now recommends reducing the rate of increase by $124 billion. So there is a gap now remaining of $44 billion, considerably closer than what had been initially in the range of $168 billion. Similarly, on Medicare, the original position of the Republican- controlled Congress was $133 billion, since reduced to $85 billion with the administration at $59 billion on a reduction on the rate of increase. So that gap is narrowing. Similarly, on the tax cut, the House figures are in the range of $350 billion and were reduced to $245 billion in the conference report. That has since been reduced further to $203 billion, while the administration proposes $130 billion. I have taken a close look at a number of the structural points in disagreement, while working with others in the House and Senate, to try to report out a bill on the Appropriations Subcommittee for Labor, Health, Human Services and Education, a subcommittee which I chair. I have had extensive negotiations with Donna Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services, Richard Riley, Secretary of Education, and Robert Reich, Secretary of Labor and find that the principal issues arise in the Departments of Education and Health and Human Services. As I have taken a look at the various issues, it seems to me that middle ground can be reached. If you take a look at the medical savings account, which is a controversial item, or the Medicare opt-out position as to HMO's back and forth, or the Medicare beneficiary part B payments, or the issue of balance billing by doctors, or the concern which has been expressed over the regulation of doctors' fees--all of those matters--if you take the congressional position as opposed to the administration position, you find there is middle ground available. If you look at the Medicaid issue, in addition to the figures narrowing, the structural matters also are subject to compromise. If you take a look at welfare, there again, compromise is possible. Where the welfare reform bill passed by the Senate with overwhelming numbers, some 87 Senators voting in favor of the measure, there was a great deal of reliance on the block grants. There is an area for compromise on providing the bulk of welfare related programs through block grants but certain specific programs should remain with standards established by the Federal Government. I think the statement made by the very distinguished Senator from Maine, Margaret Chase Smith, is worth repeating, when she distinguished between the issues of the principle of compromise as opposed to the compromise of principle. We are not talking about freedom of speech or freedom of religion or first amendment issues. We are talking about dollars and cents. And we are, really, very, very close together. So it is my hope that the negotiators will continue, because I think agreement is within reach, and when we are talking about the central principle of a balanced budget, that is something that we ought not give up on. We ought to continue to work to try to narrow the gap, and I hope that we will continue to do that.","word.count":947,"sep11":-5.78089887640449,"years":1996.07865168539,"days":384,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.185556862045542,"Topic 2":0.0283289329500692,"Topic 3":0.0157154309042097,"Topic 4":0.712607645655534,"Topic 5":0.00538893218326008,"Topic 6":0.0057795485634731,"Topic 7":0.00423999291129879,"Topic 8":0.0174261454251841,"Topic 9":0.00772606236749812,"Topic 10":0.0172304469939311},{"id":"10519980035483","body":"Gerald Solomon: With all due respect to the gentleman, we all have to have an effort of cooperation.

We have to fight for our market share because the competition is abroad and, quite frankly, they don't meet the quality standard. This program is not only for the crabs, but just think, for the people who are actually picking the crabs, they are putting people to work--the canning company, marketing, sales, the trucking industry, watermen, the people who run the marinas. This covers so many jobs on the Eastern Shore. This handful of seasonal workers helps leverage hundreds and hundreds of jobs on our shore. We could talk to Senator Stevens of Alaska. They have a business that harvests salmon roe, and their principal market is to the Japanese. The Japanese have to come in to inspect that roe to see if it can be exported. Nineteen Japanese come in every year under this program and then return home, primarily as inspectors. Because those 19 come, Alaska has a booming industry in exporting salmon roe. That is how this program works. Just a handful of guest workers leverages all this. Mr. President, I support Amendment No. 3217, the Save Our Small and Seasonal Businesses Act of 2006, which would ensure that certain employers would continue to legally obtain the seasonal workers they desperately need. I am pleased to work with Senator Mikulski as a cosponsor on the amendment, and I am joined by Senator Allen. Late in 2005, the Senate voted overwhelmingly, 94 to 6, to include our Save Our Small and Seasonal Businesses Act of 2005 as an amendment to the defense supplemental bill. This legislation, which was eventually signed into law by President Bush, helped to temporarily solve a serious problem facing small businesses, especially seafood operations in Virginia, as well as others across the Nation. For each of the 2 years prior to our measure being signed into law, the statutory cap on H-2B visas was reached soon after the fiscal years began. In 2004, the cap was reached on March 20, and in 2005 the cap was reached on January 3. As a result, many businesses, mostly summer employers, were unable to obtain the temporary workers they needed because the cap was filled prior to the day they could even apply for the visas. Consequently, these businesses sustained significant economic losses. The fix that Congress provided in 2005 exempted from the 66,000 statutory cap workers who had worked under the H-2B visa program in prior years and who had adhered to the rules by returning to their home country when their visas expired. However, this legislation was only for 2 years. As a result, on October 1, 2006, when the law expires, these employers and workers will face the same problem unless we adopt the amendment before us today. In order to avoid this problem, our amendment simply extends the successful H-2B visa exemption to ensure the program will not revert to its troubled, original form while work continues on a permanent solution. This will allow our small and seasonal companies an opportunity to remain open for business until a new permanent fix within comprehensive immigration reform can be passed into law and fully implemented. Without these modifications, these employers will struggle to find the necessary employees to keep their businesses running. Before I close, I want to be clear about the purpose of this amendment. There has been much said about Senator Specter's amendment and what it will or will not do. Regardless, his amendment will create a new H-2C temporary worker visa. In the long run, this new work visa will help ease the pressure on the H-2B visa program that exists today. However, it is now April, and the current H-2B exemption expires in October, only a few months from now. Even if Congress were to pass an immigration bill and have it signed into law before then, it will take many, many months if not years before any new visa programs can be ready to accept applications. This is an uncertainty that small businesses cannot afford. Many employers across America, such as seafood processors, landscapers, resorts, pool companies, carnivals, and timber companies, rely upon the H-2B program. The seafood industry in Virginia, in particular, is dependent on this program to keep their business running. This industry has been built on decades of earned respect for their incomparable products. They represent traditions that have been in place for hundreds of years. These traditions have proven more successful than attempts to modernize or automate the process. Without access to the H-2B visa program, this traditional respect across the world will be lost, never to be regained. The current system in place since 2005 has allowed these small and seasonal businesses opportunity to hire a legal workforce to supplement and maintain the full-time domestic workers they already employ. If we want these employers to stay in business, the current H-2B exemption must be extended until a permanent solution or a new visa program can be implemented. I strongly support this amendment, and I hope my colleagues in the Senate will join 5 with me to help these small and seasonal businesses by passing this legislation as quickly as possible.","word.count":859,"sep11":4.67696629213483,"years":2006.53651685393,"days":4107,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.322498657614727,"Topic 2":0.0668204735489285,"Topic 3":0.143400983496839,"Topic 4":0.089231294529964,"Topic 5":0.0239892032250335,"Topic 6":0.0129864291422737,"Topic 7":0.0157991370623523,"Topic 8":0.170327489421043,"Topic 9":0.141793172064762,"Topic 10":0.0131531598940785},{"id":"10920060031260","body":"Gary Miller: Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. This legislation is critical to increasing the availability of affordable rental housing in this country. I would like to thank my good friend Barney Frank. He has worked with me to introduce this important bill. And I really want to thank the Financial Services Committee chairman, Mike Oxley. He has worked diligently through this process to get the process completed in committee so that the bill could be heard tonight. When it comes to high-cost markets where land and construction costs are significantly higher than other areas of the country, there is no question that the FHA multifamily mortgage insurance limits are not keeping pace. The slowdown in affordable rental housing production has resulted in a significant gap between the demand and supply of affordable rental housing. This is a problem we have come together to solve tonight. Through its numerous multifamily housing programs, HUD is a primary partner in the development of affordable rental housing. FHA provides mortgage insurance to HUD-approved lenders to facilitate the construction, substantial rehabilitation, purchase, and refinancing of multifamily housing projects and health care facilities. Mortgage insurance covers a lender if a borrower defaults on the insured loan. The FHA multifamily program is particularly important in serving the housing needs of low- and moderate-income families. In our most expensive cities, it is very difficult for these families to find affordable rental housing in the communities where they work. Today, many public servants throughout this country, police officers, firefighters, and teachers, are not able to live in the communities in which they serve. Some commute an hour or more to get to work every day. What happens if there is a natural disaster? How will the first responders get to those in need in time if they live an hour or more away from where they work? If Congress does not act to promote the development of affordable rental units, the housing situation in high-cost areas will continue to worsen and the housing needs for those who serve our communities and keep them safe will continue to be overlooked. Developers are simply unable to provide affordable housing units in high-cost areas because the current statutory limits for FHA mortgage insurance are unrealistically low. While Congress increased the limits of 2003, construction costs have accelerated to such heights in high-cost areas that the limits need to be increased again in order to allow affordable, low- and moderate-income rental units to be built in places like California and New York and cities such as Boston. While FHA multifamily loan limits were increased in 2003, there were only a total of six FHA-insured multifamily loans for new construction or substantial rehabilitation approved in California in fiscal years 2004 and 2005 because of the loan limit. For the same time frame in the State of New York, only eight multifamily projects were approved by FHA. In Massachusetts only five projects were approved, and in New Jersey not a single new construction or rehabilitation project was approved through FHA. This bill establishes a mechanism for addressing the need for new construction or substantial rehabilitation of rental units in extremely high-cost areas throughout this country. Under this bill, the multifamily loan limits in high-cost areas would increase to 170 percent above the base limit. The Secretary of HUD would have the discretion to increase the limits to 215 percent on a case-by-case or project-by-project basis. It is important to point out that there is no private sector alternative to this program. The market served by FHA multifamily insurance does not overlap the competitive private interests. The FHA multifamily mortgage insurance program has worked with private sector partners to expand the supply of rental housing for over 65 years. This public/private partnership has leveraged more than $100 billion of private sector investment to provide rental housing for working families and elderly throughout this country. In addition, the FHA program and this increase pays for itself. In fact, the program actually has a positive budgetary impact. That means this project actually makes money for the Federal Government. For example, according to CBO, in 2002 FHA insured about $5 billion in loans for multifamily projects. The budgetary impact of these guarantees was accorded as discretionary savings of about $20 million. That means that the Federal Government made $20 million just by insuring these loans. CBO estimates that this bill would bring in $15 million in 2007 and $75 million between the 2007-2011 period. That means in those years alone, the Federal Government will make $75 million just by working on these programs. Further, let me point out that if we do not pass legislation to promote the availability of affordable rental housing, our waiting lists for public housing will continue to grow. Despite drastic funding increases in section 8, waiting lists continue to grow across this Nation. In some cities, such as those in Southern California, families who sign up on a waiting list today will not receive an apartment for another 10 years. This bill is a step in the direction of reducing dependency on government programs by providing a move-up market for affordable rental units. In closing, it is important to note that we are not giving grants. We are not doing something that is going to lose money for any congressional district, because this bill does not take away money from low-cost areas. This bill, basically with the FHA mortgage insurance program, provides a critically needed financing source for affordable rental housing. It is important that this program be usable in areas that are experiencing a severe shortage of affordable units and rising development costs. I want to conclude by saying this is not a giveaway program. This is a program that is an assistance to the private sector and a program that actually makes money for the private sector and through the government.

Scott: Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 6625, the Veterans Voting Support Act, which contains several provisions to help Veterans as they participate in the political process. First, it will require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to allow States to designate V.A. facilities as voter registration agencies. The bill will also require V.A. facilities to provide information and assist election officials to ensure proper delivery of voting material. Additional, the bill prohibits the Secretary of Veterans Affairs from restricting non- partisan organizations and state election organizations from providing information at V.A. facilities. This bill will help to prevent Department of Veterans Affairs policies from withholding information from Veterans on voter registration and voting. The Department of Veterans Affairs previously adopted a policy that prohibits voter registration drives on V.A. grounds. The Department of Veterans Affairs recently changed that policy and now allows state and local election officials as well as non-partisan organizations to provide veterans help. However, the language of the policy still allows individual V.A. facilities to restrict access to these groups. This legislation will guarantee that individuals and organizations with the appropriate knowledge are given the right to assist our veterans in the voting registration process. Our veterans have dedicated their lives to our country's safety and deserve the opportunity to be assisted in the political process. Given that many of our veterans are disabled or ill with special assistance needs as a result of their service to our country, we should make every possible accommodation to provide them with the assistance they need to take a part in the political process and have their voices heard. It would be ironic for those fighting for our freedom and ability to participate in our democracy to themselves be denied the ability to participate. I commend Rep.

Mr. Chairman, this resolution deals with the President's Task Force on National Health Care Reform. That task force was concerned about quality health care for the people of this country. It dealt with many subjects, including how to expand health care insurance for many Americans who had no health care insurance, and it was also deeply concerned about quality standards and consumer protection for people who are in managed care programs. Each of us have heard from our constituents their concern that the practice of medicine, the medical decisions are being made by bureaucrats rather than by medical professionals. The United States District Court ruling that is the subject matter of this resolution awarded attorneys' fees for some physicians who challenged the work of that task force. This sense of Congress resolution says that those attorney fees should not be paid for by taxpayer funds. As the gentleman from California pointed out, the law says that attorneys' fees can only be paid for by the government, and, therefore, if this sense of Congress resolution was carried out, if we made it law, as my friend the gentleman from California pointed out, the plaintiffs in that lawsuit would not be able to recover any attorneys' fees, which is certainly contrary to the intent of the sponsors of this resolution. That is why this sense of Congress resolution makes no sense. The impact, though, could have an impact. As the subcommittee chairman Mr. Kolbe pointed out, it is his intention to deny these funds from the White House budget. Therefore, this resolution could have an effect if we pass it, a psychological effect and a chilling effect, on people who want to serve their government on task forces that look at problems. The work of the President's Task Force on National Health Care Reform goes forward. We have had a President's Commission on Quality Standards for Managed Care. The work of the task force moves forward, important work. We have legislation pending that deals with those recommendations. One deals with external appeal for managed care programs. I received a phone call this morning from a constituent, a constituent whose child needed institutional care, who was being threatened to be taken out of the hospital just arbitrarily by the managed care operator. That is wrong. That plan had no external appeal, independent appeal, so that person could take that grievance to an independent body. We need to correct that. We need people who are willing to serve on task forces to correct that. This resolution will have a chilling effect on people serving on those types of task forces. We have legislation here that would provide access to emergency care. Today I can tell you of examples in my community where people who are in a managed care program go to an emergency room. They have chest pains, they are sweating, they think they are having a cardiac problem. They go to the emergency room. The good news is that they didn't have a heart attack, but then when they get the bill from the hospital and the managed care plan refuses to pay because the diagnosis was not an emergency, they almost have a heart attack. We need to enact legislation, the work of that task force, in order to correct those problems. We have circumstances every day that people need referral to specialists, and the managed care plan prevents that referral. We need people willing to serve on task forces in order to correct those problems. So, Mr. Chairman, it is important that we do not send the message out today that we do not want to see people work and provide their expertise and independence, so the Congress can get the benefit of their work. The sense of Congress resolution should call upon us to enact quickly the consumer protection provisions for managed care plans. Then the sense of Congress resolution would make more sense. Better yet, we should use the time tonight that we are debating this resolution to debate the bills themselves, to provide the protection that each of our constituents want and deserve. Why not bring those bills before us this evening, and then we really could provide the protection that people need that are in managed care programs. If we did that, then the call I received today from my constituent, we would not be receiving them tomorrow, and we will be receiving those calls tomorrow, each one of us know that. I hope that we can turn this resolution into action, so that this Congress acts on what is really important to my constituents, providing national standards for quality care in this country. Then we will be doing a service to the taxpayer.","word.count":799,"sep11":-3.6938202247191,"years":1998.16573033708,"days":1127,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0933791958055012,"Topic 2":0.135780382639538,"Topic 3":0.0228345493261706,"Topic 4":0.562807575556911,"Topic 5":0.0058960002433856,"Topic 6":0.00333989292085084,"Topic 7":0.127879344788461,"Topic 8":0.00702441201624512,"Topic 9":0.0325320391352432,"Topic 10":0.00852660756769284},{"id":"10820040046075","body":"Ron Wyden: Mr. President, it is time for the Bush administration to end its campaign of inaction on gasoline price hikes.

If they do, that is going to take 1 million barrels of oil off the market per day, when U.S. private oil supplies are already millions of barrels low and when U.S. gasoline prices are at record highs. Folks on the west coast of the United States are getting clobbered by these gasoline price hikes. People in California pay considerably more than $2 a gallon. Folks in my home State of Oregon are close behind, paying an average of more than $1.80 in some of our towns. There is a perfect storm coming with respect to these gasoline price hikes. The combination of the Bush administration filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at the wrong time, the fact we have these refinery cutbacks on the west coast that seem as much to boost profit as anything else, the Federal Trade Commission turning a blind eye to anticompetitive profits, and the shenanigans of OPEC are the factors that are coming together to create what I think could be a perfect storm with gasoline prices of $3 a gallon.

For the life of me, I cannot understand the administration's insistence on continuing to swipe oil out of the private U.S. market and squirrel it away in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at a time when the American consumer is getting clobbered each week at the gasoline station. The Bush administration needs to stop filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The administration is spending American tax dollars to buy oil at record high prices and put it in the reserve, and apparently they are saying they will not stop it. But, in fact, they did stop filling the reserve when it helped the oil companies. They stopped filling the reserve in December 2002 when the oil companies needed more supply for refineries. It seems to me the message today is what the administration is willing to do for the big oil companies they ought to do for the American consumer, and particularly the ones I represent on the west coast of the United States. There is no substitute for leadership when American families are hurting financially and getting shellacked by these gasoline price hikes. It is interesting to note that when the President was a candidate in 2000, he said the President ought to be using his bully pulpit to jawbone OPEC. This administration is not doing that. Last week, they took credit for oil coming down about $1 a barrel. The fact was, that was a day late and $7 a barrel short because the price is still way above the OPEC price target level. We come to the floor today to say when the American people are hurting, there needs to be Presidential leadership. These gas prices are hurting my constituents. They are devastating to businesses and to consumers on the west coast, and they are driving up prices for goods and transportation in this country. We have a proposal. It is to stop filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, No. 1. No. 2, it is for the Federal Trade Commission to get off the dime and look at these anticompetitive practices. I have introduced legislation, S. 1737. If the Bush administration does not like that bill, I would like to hear their proposal. Let's hear what they are going to do to stand up for the west coast consumer. It seems the administration is busy filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve with no regard for rising gas prices. They are busy with their campaign of inaction that seems to help nobody but the oil companies and will not direct the Federal Trade Commission to take steps now to protect the consumer. I think the American people deserve better. I yield the floor.","word.count":749,"sep11":2.61516853932584,"years":2004.47471910112,"days":3373,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.506943340101678,"Topic 2":0.226422176296784,"Topic 3":0.00716364931217203,"Topic 4":0.0163700245353476,"Topic 5":0.00841803493953,"Topic 6":0.00819466956598613,"Topic 7":0.0114406953659883,"Topic 8":0.0130539425736001,"Topic 9":0.196538096435793,"Topic 10":0.00545537087312138},{"id":"10419950049622","body":"Mark Foley: Mr. President, we need to take immediate steps to implement a plan to better allocate health care funding among the Department's health care facilities so that veterans, no matter where they live or what circumstances they face, have equal access to quality health care. The amendment that I propose here today with my distinguished colleague, Senator Bob Graham of Florida, will, I hope, finally direct the Department of Veterans Affairs to do the right thing. That is, to eliminate funding disparities among VA health care facilities across the country. Mr. President, inequity in veterans' access to health care is an issue that I originally brought to Secretary Jesse Brown's attention in March 1994. The Department of Veterans Affairs is currently using an archaic and unresponsive formula to allocate health care resources. The system must be updated to account for population shifts. The veterans population in three States, including Arizona, is growing, at the same time that it is declining in other parts of the country. Unfortunately, health care allocations have not kept up with the changes. The impact of disparate funding has been very obvious to me during my visits to many VA medical centers throughout the country, and particularly in Arizona, and was confirmed by a formal survey of the Carl T. Hayden VA Medical Center in Phoenix, which was conducted by the Veterans of Foreign Wars [VFW] in April 1994. The problem has been further verified by the General Accounting Office [GAO] in a report entitled ``Veterans Health Care: Facilities' Resource Allocations Could Be More Equitable.'' The GAO found that the Department of Veterans Affairs continues to allocate funding based on past budgets rather than current needs, and has failed to implement the Resource Planning and Management system [RPM] developed 2 years ago to help remedy funding inequity. Mr. President, the GAO cites VA data that the workload of some facilities increased by as much as 15 percent between 1993 and 1995, while the workload of others declined by as much as 8 percent. However, in the two budget cycles studied, the VA made only minimal changes in funding allocations. The maximum loss to a facility was 1 percent of its past budget and the average gain was also about 1 percent. This inadequate response to demographic change over the past decade is very disturbing, and, I believe, wrong. To illustrate the problem, I would point out that the Carl T. Hayden VA Medical Center experienced the third highest workload growth based on 17 hospitals of similar size and mission, yet was only funded at less than half the RPM process. Mr. President, the GAO informs me that rather than implementing the RPM process to remedy funding inequities in access to veterans health care, the VA has resorted to rationing health care or eliminating health care to certain veterans in areas of high demand. The GAO says: The GAO also indicates that there is confusion among the Department's staff regarding the reasons for funding variations among the VA facilities and the purpose of the RPM system. Mr. President, this problem must be addressed now. This amendment compels the VA to take expeditious action to remedy this serious problem and adequately address the changes in demand at VA facilities. To conclude, I want to reiterate that I find it simply unconscionable that the VA could place the Carl T. Hayden VA Medical Center at the bottom of the funding ladder, when the three VA medical facilities in the State of Arizona must care for a growing number of veterans, and are inundated every year by winter visitors, which places an additional burden on the facilities. I ask unanimous consent that the VFW survey and the GAO summary report be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:","word.count":338,"sep11":-6.15168539325843,"years":1995.70786516854,"days":252,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0157013352239325,"Topic 2":0.0727667811511118,"Topic 3":0.12841862806127,"Topic 4":0.0958205776217979,"Topic 5":0.0263935866895866,"Topic 6":0.0294077362942776,"Topic 7":0.0955595412239473,"Topic 8":0.0599336440353551,"Topic 9":0.456364004168754,"Topic 10":0.0196341655299668},{"id":"10620000008372","body":"Sheila Jackson-Lee: Mr. Speaker, I am in total agreement that the IRS tax code is confusing. In fact, I affirm making the tax code more understandable for average Americans. I even hope to address outdated tax issues such as the telephone excise tax adopted a century ago to help fund the Spanish American War in 1898 and re-imposed during World War I, which is still with us today. However, this bill is another attempt by the Republicans to enact irresponsible legislation. The notion that Congress should abolish most of the tax code by December 31, 2004 is not in the best interest of America's hard working families. The Republicans are offering this bill with no viable alternative to the tax code in place. The notion that we can enact legislation essentially eliminating the tax code without a well-reasoned alternative is a violation of the public trust. This measure is nothing more than another election year ploy designed by the Republicans around tax time. This is nothing more than a tax gift to the special interests that would like nothing more than to scrap the tax code. The termination of the tax code has become a top priority of the Republican agenda. To vote for this bill without coming forward with a credible alternative to finance our government's operations is playing our nation's taxpayers for fools. The most glaring aspect of this measure is the fact the if we pass a bill which terminates the tax code between now and December 21, 2002, our entire economy will be in a state of confusion. The capital markets do not like uncertainty in our country's fiscal policy. Our industrial and commercial sectors will not have the certainty and predictability required to have an efficient economy. If we pass this bill it is highly likely that the long period of prosperity enjoyed by our nation will soon end. How long can our economy operate without knowing what the tax consequences of their investment decisions will yield? We have come too far from the days of recession in 1991 to take actions that will threaten the hard won progress made to date. State and local governments that issue tax-exempt municipal bonds with low interest rates to finance capital activity. If we eliminate the tax code without assuring current holders of tax-exempt municipal bonds of their tax status many Americans will be adversely affected. What about home mortgages? The home mortgage deduction is one of the linchpins of the American dream. Without it, many moderate and low- income Americans would not be able to own their homes. The tax deductibility of home mortgages is not only a great advantage, but it also impacts the entire home builder and mortgage industry that relies on a healthy housing market. The Scrap the Tax Code Act deserves to be scrapped itself. This bill has nothing but the interest of the wealthy who seek tax relief on the backs of our nation's workers. Let us get onto serious legislation such as gun control, strengthening Social Security and Medicare, as well as, paying down the national debt. If we need to have additional hearings on improving the tax code I am in favor of looking at alternatives. Our people deserve more than election year gimmicks; they deserve serious legislators who produce meaningful legislation that puts families first.

Ehlers: Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr. Chairman, we are debating here today fundamentally important legislation. It is fundamentally important legislation because there is no more basic, more critical, more fundamental and more important duty of our Government than to protect its citizens, their homes, their businesses, our public institutions from acts of terrorism, from acts perpetrated by criminals in whatever capacity whatsoever. Mr. Chairman, I think it is also important as we debate this important bill, the effective Death Penalty and Public Safety Act of 1996, to be careful and mindful of how best to frame the debate over these issues. I do not think it would be appropriate, Mr. Chairman, to think of our framing this debate in terms of preventing every act of terrorism. If we framed the debate thusly, then we would be forever frustrated in our analysis, in our efforts, because we will never stop criminal activities, no matter how many laws we pass, no matter how effectively or how broadly all of those criminal laws are enforced. Rather, Mr. Chairman, we need to keep this debate focused on two things. First, Mr. Chairman, how can we most effectively and most comprehensively minimize the chances for acts of terror being committed against our citizens, our institutions, and our homes? The second point that we must keep in mind, Mr. Chairman, throughout this and other debates that we will have in this great body, is how would we do so, how do we pass laws that minimize the chance for terrorist acts and other criminal acts being committed, balanced against the very important, fundamentally important civil liberties that all of us here in this country enjoy enshrined in that great document, our Constitution. Indeed, Mr. Chairman, the balancing of these concerns is fundamental to the very makeup, the very structure of our Government; the balance between individual freedom and government power, and another balance that is important to keep in mind, Mr. Chairman, the balance between government accountability and absolute government power. Mr. Chairman, this bill that we are considering here today, crafted in large part by my esteemed colleague from Illinois, the great chairman of the Judiciary Committee, in almost every respect properly balances those concerns, and indeed should be a hallmark for the American people to look to in terms of how to craft legislation that does protect our citizens while being mindful of the important civil liberties guaranteed to all of us. But, Mr. Chairman, I have before this House today at this time an amendment that includes several provisions that I believe strengthen that balance on the side of protecting individual liberties, while at the same time giving to the Government those tools that it needs to effectively investigate and prosecute acts of terror. With regard to the various provisions in H.R. 2703 that my amendment seeks to delete, Mr. Chairman, I think it is also important to note that in many of these instances I have proposed their deletion knowing that there are existing, current Federal laws which will remain on the books and fully available to our law enforcement agencies and our Federal prosecutors, laws and adequate safeguards to protect us against acts of terrorism. I would draw attention, for example, Mr. Chairman, to section 212 of our Immigration Act, which clearly defines and gives the Government full and plenary power to exclude and deport not only terrorists but terrorist organizations. I would also draw attention, Mr. Chairman, to the provision in my amendment which would seek to delete section 601 of this bill that relates to special, read that secret proceedings to exclude or deport aliens with provable terrorist connections. If the Barr amendment is adopted, Mr. Chairman, on this particular point, as one example of the balance in my amendment, we will be doing nothing, absolutely nothing to weaken the very strong tools that our Government currently has under the Immigration Act, for one example, to exclude and deport terrorists or terrorist organizations. My amendment, with regard specifically to section 601, would simply say we must do so openly, in the light of day, without having the entire proceedings not only secret but so secret that the defendant himself or herself is not even made aware of the evidence against them other than in at best a summary form, with that summary provided by the Government. I would also want to ensure that my colleagues know that again, for example, with regard to my proposed deletion of section 601, that the provisions of the Classified Information Protection Act or CIPA remain fully available to the Government. If my amendment is adopted, it does not weaken the ability of our Government to protect against disclosure of classified, important national security information in whatever proceeding, including exclusion or deportation proceedings. I would also like, Mr. Chairman, to focus on many of the limitations that the chairman and others who support this legislation have very properly crafted into the bill, that provide a very real and very substantial limit on expansion and abuse of Federal authority, and we all know that from time to time that does in fact occur. For example, Mr. Chairman, with regard to title I of this bill, there is protection afforded to all Federal employees and former Federal employees against somebody seeking to kill them because of their Federal employment. This corrects, I think, Mr. Chairman, an imbalance in the current laws of our country that would afford that protection only to certain covered, explicitly listed in our statute, categories of Federal employees. I do not think, Mr. Chairman, that if a person who works for our Social Security Administration goes to work, that he or she should do so knowing that they are any less valuable to our country and should receive any less protection than somebody that works across the hall from them, that may work for the U.S. attorney's office instead of for the Social Security Administration. This bill properly protects against abuses of Federal authority in these areas. It is not a vast expansion of Federal authority. For example, further, Mr. Chairman, with regard to title I, the bill does prohibit material support to terrorist organizations. It is clearly limited to those who provide material, demonstrable, substantive support to terrorist organizations, not any organization but terrorist organizations. Further with regard to title I, it is important to recognize the very strict limitations included in H.R. 2703. For example, with regard to acts of terrorism transcending national boundaries, there are several explicit limiting provisions in this legislation. The underlying predicate with provides for the basic Federal jurisdiction, in the first place, it must cross national boundaries. There must be one of several additional jurisdictional bases before the Federal Government can become involved. Third, the Attorney General must certify explicitly in writing that the proposed case which it seeks to prosecute is also a Federal crime of terrorism that explicitly, and I repeat explicitly, requires that the crime be designed to influence or to affect U.S. Government policies or conduct. It must relate, then, to a series of explicitly laid out provisions in our current criminal code. For those Members, Mr. Chairman, who are very properly fearful of abuse of Government power, which does occur from time to time, and are hesitant to grant ever-increasing powers to the Government without a firm constitutional and practical basis for doing so, I say to them that those provisions in title I are replete with provisions that explicitly limit the reach of the Federal Government only to those instances of criminal behavior directly affecting our Federal public institutions and personnel. Returning, Mr. Chairman, to my proposed amendment and its constituent parts, I believe it does correct some remaining imbalances in H.R. 2703 on which the chairman and his staff and I and my staff and dozens of other individuals have worked mightily for the better half of a year on this. For example, Mr. Chairman, there are provisions in this bill currently which I would seek to delete, which do not affect the underlying important substance of the bill but which would avoid potential problems in the future. If the Government, for example, Mr. Chairman, is going to prosecute someone who sells a firearm to somebody who then later uses it in the commission of a crime, I do not believe it is unreasonable to require the Government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the person that sold that firearm knew that it was going to be subsequently used in the commission of a crime. Changing and lowering that burden substantially, Mr. Chairman, as the current provisions of H.R. 2703 would do, to the person having reasonable cause to believe, for example, that the firearm might be used in a future crime, is too vague. It is unnecessary. The Government can currently reach the person that sells a firearm with reasonable knowledge that it will be used in the commission of a crime. A further provision explicitly dealt with, Mr. Chairman, in my omnibus amendment addresses section 305, the so-called Mack truck provision. I call this a Mack truck provision, Mr. Chairman, because it is so broad, in looking back over it, that one could drive a Mack truck through it. This is the so-called good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule for wiretap evidence. In layman's terms, Mr. Chairman, this provision would allow the Government to use whatever it overhears in any electronic surveillance activity, whether related to a crime of terrorism or any other crime or other behavior which the Government seeks to stop, even if that evidence was acquired illegally, as long as the Government can go into court and show that it believed or its agents believed that they were operating in go","word.count":767,"sep11":-6.76404494382022,"years":1995.09550561798,"days":34,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.113418336097969,"Topic 2":0.0154513948279329,"Topic 3":0.00493680127240443,"Topic 4":0.00764559114090583,"Topic 5":0.0020858548457798,"Topic 6":0.092859466031741,"Topic 7":0.00797810366436037,"Topic 8":0.0401786377330239,"Topic 9":0.712889134744293,"Topic 10":0.00255667964159087},{"id":"10419950022043","body":"Randy (Duke) Cunningham: I commend Chairman Callahan and Ranking Member Wilson for their successful efforts for the second year in a row in putting together a foreign aid bill which has bipartisan support. As a member of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, I know the work that has gone into this bill and the efforts that have been made to bridge many differences on the purpose, the priorities, and the funding level of our foreign aid programs. I would like to thank the subcommittee staff, Charlie Flickner, Bill Inglee, John Shank, and Lori Maes, and our Democratic staffpersons Mark Murray and Kathleen Murphy for their hard work on this bill. In the current fiscal climate, we have to make many difficult choices cutting funding for many worthy programs. Our decisions must be based on fact, not myth. We have before us today one of the most misunderstood and maligned bills the Congress is regularly privileged to consider. The misperceptions surrounding foreign aid are legion and we, as leaders, have an obligation to set the record straight. We will hear today from some of our colleagues that the American people do not support foreign aid. That is not true. The American people's overwhelming humanitarian response to crisis, to famine, to tragedy overseas, is evidence of their concern. According to recent surveys, Americans believe we should spend 15 percent of our budget on foreign aid--they think we spend 40 percent on foreign aid--and do not know that we spend less than 1 percent on foreign aid. Today's bill continues the recent downward trend in spending on foreign aid, providing $1 billion less than the President's request for fiscal year 1997 , and $458 million less than the fiscal year 1996 level. Foreign aid is a good investment in a number of ways. Our limited foreign aid dollars provide returns to our country many times over through assisting our allies and increasing our national security, providing much-needed humanitarian relief and easing human suffering. In addition, we get numerous economic benefits from our foreign aid investments. Eighty percent of our development assistance is spent here in the United States, providing jobs for American workers, and expanding markets abroad. I support a number of this bill's provisions and thank Chairman Callahan, in particular, for his continued leadership in providing funding for global AIDS programs and for his assistance in addressing my concerns about some reporting requirements related to Hong Kong. That said, I cannot ignore the parts of this bill which I believe should be changed. I am particularly concerned about the impact of funding cuts on programs to meet the needs of the poorest of the poor around the world, including IDA and the IADB's Fund for Special Operations. I am also concerned about the reduced ability of our foreign aid programs to meet the development challenges on the continent of Africa. I believe we should reinstate the Development Fund for Africa as a separate account and provide funding for the African Development Bank and African Development Foundation, for example. And, I am particularly concerned about the consequences for the global environment of cuts in funding for global environment programs and of cuts in funding and restrictions on population assistance funds. Overpopulation is a threat to us all. The world is already experiencing a serious strain on its natural resources; increased population growth at current rates will only increase environmental degradation. We cannot be close-minded or short-sighted on this issue. What happens in other countries must be of interest here at home. Pollution does not stop at our borders. Diseases also do not stop at our borders. Stabilizing population growth is critical to us all. In addition, I am very concerned that the population provisions contained in this bill will have the opposite impact of what our well- meaning colleagues intend. The 35-percent cut in population assistance funding contained in this bill can be expected to result in 7 million couples in developing countries left without access to modern, safe contraceptive methods; 4 million women experiencing unintended pregnancies; 1.6 million more abortions; 8,000 more women dying in pregnancy and childbirth, including those from unsafe abortions; and 134,000 infant deaths. These are not abstract arguments. These are real people whose suffering and whose deaths that we have the power to prevent. U.S. foreign assistance has been at the forefront in saving lives, building democracy and achieving economic growth in the developing world. While failures associated with foreign aid programs have been well publicized, the success stories receive little attention. We can be proud that hundreds of millions of people around the world have achieved substantial improvements in their living standards around the world. We can be proud of the millions of children in developing countries whose lives have been saved by the immunization programs which we have funded. Yes, improvements can still be made. Everything can always be improved. The administration should be commended for the progress it has made in increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of our development programs. We should make every effort to fund these programs at adequate and appropriate levels. This bill is a step in that direction.","word.count":391,"sep11":-6.62359550561798,"years":1995.23595505618,"days":84,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.534047409305508,"Topic 2":0.0420588721415399,"Topic 3":0.0121600368624217,"Topic 4":0.0189521891474778,"Topic 5":0.00604997210630565,"Topic 6":0.0940960340311782,"Topic 7":0.18036729395067,"Topic 8":0.0284802309998517,"Topic 9":0.0805310522379675,"Topic 10":0.0032569092170794},{"id":"11020070002141","body":"Dennis J.

That was kind of the order of the day here during the last 12 years before the election of 2006. Everything was going to be a partisan fight, and there really wasn't going to be any real effort to reach across the aisle. That's changed. You and I weren't here, but we know what the perception was from the outside. And the perception, and I think Ms. Wasserman Schultz will testify, that was backed up by reality. Now, cooperation that you see on the economic stimulus package doesn't mean that you still don't fight for what you believe in when you have an honest-to-goodness disagreement, and we are going to talk a little bit tonight about some fights that are about to come, some lines in the sand that we, as Democrats, are prepared to draw with the President and his Republican followers here in the House. But there are so many other things that you don't need to fight about, there is honest-to-goodness agreement on, whether it be jump-starting this economy with an economic stimulus package, whether it be passing reasonable restraints on the mortgage market, opening up access to liquidity for people who want to refinance their homes, have a means to do it but can't find anybody to give them the money and the access to capital. Those are issues that don't have right and left divides. The economic downturn doesn't discriminate against you whether you're a Republican or a Democrat. So we are passing bills here to deal with this economic slowdown with Republicans and Democrats behind it, and that's what people want us to do. Now, that doesn't mean they want this Chamber to be Kumbaya on every single issue. They sent us here to fight for what we believe and what the American people believe in. But you don't have to default to one position all the time or the other position all the time. You don't have to be cooperating on everything or fighting on everything. You can pick and choose.

I mean, why would you have to? If you have a majority of Republicans here, you can just pass it with Republicans. So why reach out to Democrats? The majority rules in the House. That's not what the American people want. They want to see that bipartisan partnership. They want to see bills not passing 51 percent to 49 percent. They want to see some bills passing by a real majority. That's what you saw with the 100 hours agenda, and that's what Ms. Wasserman Schultz pointed out. That's what you saw with the economic stimulus.

In the last 4 years, something again that the minority party does not discuss when they talk about the budget or our control during that period of time, in the last 4 years we have paid down almost $450 billion of the national debt. That is an unheard of, unprecedented phenomenon that came as a result, of course, of the fact that we had an economy that was expanding and government revenues were increasing. But does anyone listening to the debate tonight on this floor think for a second that if the Democratic Party had been in charge during that particular period of time that we would have taken the dollars coming in to the government and not spent them on new programs and expanding the Federal Government? Madam Speaker, I hasten to add that I think even Members of the other party would recognize that is the history that they give us. So to come tonight, and I am sure as will happen tomorrow to the floor of the House of Representatives, and talk about the need to be more concerned or more focused on the budget issue begs the question. What happened when they had the reins of control here? What did they do? The fact is that they spent not only every dollar that came in, but hundreds of billions of dollars that did not come in, hundreds of billions of dollars that we had to borrow from the taxpayers. We have tried to change that direction in the last 4 years; and we are going to offer a balanced budget, a frightening concept perhaps to the other side, but it is one with which they will have to deal. The primary issue that I raise tonight is not, however, the one dealing with the budget. There will be plenty of discussion dealing with that tomorrow; but it is the issue of our national security, because of course that is the most important thing with which this Congress can ever deal. Whether we are talking about budget or anything else, the reality is we have relatively few true responsibilities given to us by the Constitution of this Nation. They are delineated in the Constitution, and the Constitution is added to by the Bill of Rights. The last of the 10 amendments to the Constitution is very specific, and it says in case there is something you are confused about in the list of things that are the responsibility for the Federal Government, we are going to make it even more clear, that is, if it is not clear, it is not your responsibility, it is the responsibility of the States and the people therein. But there is something that is uniquely our responsibility, and that is the defense of the Nation. We cannot rely upon States individually to raise the budget to defend the country through any other process. That, of course, is our responsibility. There are several ways to do that. One is to make sure that our military is quality funded, make sure that the men and women serving in the military of the United States have every possible weapon at their disposal and in our arsenal that would first protect them; and, secondly, get the job done wherever we send them. Time and again when we are watching television or reading reports in the Congress about the marvelous and incredible undertakings with which the military is involved, we recognize that the valor of the men and women who serve really and truly is the bottom line. We can give them all of the equipment in the world, but it boils down to the individual that is there on the field of battle and what is in his or her heart at the time. We can be proud and we are proud of the people that serve in our military, and we work hard to make sure that they have what is necessary to get the job done and to protect them because they are, in turn, protecting the Nation. We recognize that the fight for the Nation, that the battle goes on in a variety of different venues. It is not like any other war. This has been said many times. The war we are in is not like any other war we have ever been in, or likely to be in, in that it will not be marked by a confrontation between two huge armies until one capitulates and the state that they represent or are fighting for has fallen. That is certainly not going to be the conflicts of the 21st century. The conflict arises in Afghanistan, the Republic of Georgia, the Philippines, and Indonesia. All over the world, we find we have to stamp out the tentacles of fundamentalist Islam as represented by al Qaeda specifically, and the terrorists who have as their end-desire the destruction of this Nation. We know that is the case, and we know we are doing a good job there. I commend the President of the United States for his leadership and my colleagues for their support of all of the appropriations that have been passed and made available so that all of the people out there are fully equipped. But there is another thing, there is another side to this battle that we pay little attention to, unfortunately. Far too little attention. It is the battle that goes on to defend our own borders. The one thing that is typical in this battle, in this war, typical to other kinds of wars we have been in, is the fact of invasion where large numbers of people come across the border of one country undetected without permission of the country they are entering; and some of them, certainly not all, thank God at this point in time, but some of them have ill-intent. Some of them choose and come here with the very purpose of doing us harm. Many others, unfortunately, who come across the border, do not choose to do us any physical harm, but are not really connected to the United States in any way similar to the immigrants who have come to the United States in the heyday of immigration, in the past 100 years or so. For the most part, people coming into the United States during that period of time, during the 1800s, early 1900s, came with the distinct purpose to separate themselves from the land from which they came, and to attach themselves to a new land and a new idea and new set of principles. They wanted to break the political and even linguistic ties they had with their country of origin and start something new. They committed to America. Of course they wanted a better life and of course they looked forward to giving their children a better life, just like the immigrants of today do. But there is a significant difference. Millions of people are looking for that better life, but they are not disassociating themselves from the country of their origin, not linguistically, not culturally and sometimes not even politically. Today, as I speak, we find that there is something happening in the United States which has never happened before, and that is a dramatic rise in the number of people who are here in this country, relatively recent immigrants to the United States, who claim dual citizenship. That is to say they claim to be both Americans and citizens of the country of their origin. They choose not to break those ties. Now that I would suggest, Madam Speaker, has never happened before. That is a new phenomenon. Something is peculiar about that, and something is dangerous about that when we talk about what is going to be necessary in order for us to survive this clash we are in with international terrorism, which can be characterized as a clash of civilizations. Samuel Huntington in a book I reference often called ``Clash of Civilizations'' talks about the fact that the United States will be significantly hobbled in its ability to lead the West if we ourselves are a cleft Nation, a Nation divided in half. That is exactly what is happening to us, and one of the reasons why I have raised the concern about massive immigration, legal and illegal, into the United States, over the past couple of decades. The agency to which we entrust the responsibility for protecting our borders and for helping us maintain some sense or even a tiny bit of hope that we can actually control the process of who comes in, for how long, for what purpose and knowing when they leave, the agency to which we entrust that responsibility is the INS, the Immigration and Naturalization Service. This agency has 35,000 employees. It has a budget of about $7.5 billion. In the budget resolution we are going to pass tomorrow, it will call for about a billion dollar increase. It is an increase of 250 percent over the last 10 years. I bring that up because we are going to hear from that agency when we talk about the problems within it that they do not have enough money, they do not have the resources. They will talk about not having enough people, but in fact we have actually increased the number of people serving in the INS by 83 percent over the last decade. A 250 percent budget increase, 83 perce","word.count":5298,"sep11":0.530898876404494,"years":2002.3904494382,"days":2631,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.523453193224198,"Topic 2":0.0593810183151757,"Topic 3":0.0240431691756951,"Topic 4":0.0365354497155521,"Topic 5":0.112675361787686,"Topic 6":0.011699929318371,"Topic 7":0.00733971030917813,"Topic 8":0.0818480497004799,"Topic 9":0.0134442021168226,"Topic 10":0.129579916336842},{"id":"10720010073942","body":"Tom Daschle: Again, I think the Senator is absolutely right.

We are all aware of the fundamental changes in Americans' life expectancy throughout the century. When Medicare was created in 1965, the average life expectancy for a woman who reached the age of 65 was 80 and for a man 78 years of age. In 1998, the life expectancy jumped to 84 years for a woman and 81 for a man. Projections for the year 2100 assume that the average life span for an individual who reaches 65 will be 94 years for a woman and 91 for a man. These statistics paint a clear picture--seniors are living longer and to ensure their quality of life, they must have guaranteed access to prescription medications. The Republicans say that they want a prescription drug benefit. The Democrats say that they want a prescription drug benefit. The question facing both parties is this: Do they really want a benefit or just an election year bully pulpit? If the answer is a benefit, we're here today to help. On far too many occasions in the last few years, important legislation has been knocked off the tracks by election year, partisan train wrecks. We hope that this year can be different. That is why we are offering a new Medicare prescription drug benefit--one that we believe represents a workable compromise between the Democratic and Republican positions. Our Proposal--the Medicare Outpatient Drug Act of 2000--is centrist. It is bipartisan. It is innovative. And we think it can pass Congress this year. I must mention that this effort has been a truly collaborative one from start to finish. The MOD Act has several key components: Universality--access for everyone; Consistency--keeps with the important tradition of the Medicare program by providing a defined, reliable benefit for all seniors alike. A senior in Fargo, North Dakota is assured access to the same defined benefit structure as a senior in Miami, Florida; Voluntary participation, like Medicare Part B; Special protections for low income Americans; True stop-loss protection, which ensures seamless insurance without gaps in coverage; A ramp-up payment system, which decreases beneficiary payments based on their increased prescription medication needs; and The use of Multiple Pharmacy Benefit Managers to administer the benefit and promote competition and choice. For many years I have spoken about the need to move the Medicare program from one based on acute care and illness to one focused on prevention and wellness. The Medicare Wellness Act of 2000, of which many of my colleague are cosponsors and which ensures seniors access to a variety of preventive programs and screenings, represents the first piece of this puzzle--The MOD Act represents the second step in my three-point plan for accomplishing this goal. Prescription drugs are an integral part of health care and must be integrated in to the current Medicare system as a defined benefit--not as an ``add on.'' It is my understanding that the House Republicans have proposed a bill that entrusts the private insurance market to provide a prescription drug benefit to seniors. Though, on the surface these ideals have appeal and they are initially less expensive or claim to be ``more flexible'' than a comprehensive, universal benefit, I find myself asking the question: Are there other Medicare benefits that are or should be treated in this capacity? Let's take the example of physician services, for example, anesthesiology services. Would we ask private insurance companies to create anesthesiology-only insurance packages? Would beneficiaries purchase such policies? Would they be available? What would be the result of extricating this benefit from the Medicare program. With prescription drugs representing one of the most prevalent treatments in health care today--I ask myself, ``Is it wise to look toward an approach to providing coverage of prescritpion medication which is arguably unworkable in everyother sector of medicine?'' Leaders in the health insurance industry have stated that ``Lawmakers should avoid drug insurance-only coverage, which is unlikely to get off the ground and which would be impossible to price affordably.'' The MOD Act creates a defined, affordable, consistent prescription drug benefit within the Medicare system where it should be. The third piece to solving the Medicare puzzle lies in the need to give the Medicare program the tools to compete in the current health care market place. My colleagues and I will soon be introducing a reform bill that will have the dual effect of providing significant savings to offset the bill that we are introducing today. I encourage my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this important piece of legislation.","word.count":452,"sep11":-2.39044943820225,"years":1999.4691011236,"days":1591,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0152938013165282,"Topic 2":0.0472261711455321,"Topic 3":0.00488112505339381,"Topic 4":0.117609767623643,"Topic 5":0.00285893129942156,"Topic 6":0.00386229209606705,"Topic 7":0.56760063637123,"Topic 8":0.0147079795179767,"Topic 9":0.221499308973939,"Topic 10":0.00445998660226814},{"id":"10820030047215","body":"Norm Coleman: Is there objection?

I want to commend Senator Harkin for this bill. Through his leadership, the Senate has passed a Farm Bill that will establish a better economic safety net for many farmers, bolster conservation efforts, improve nutrition and food security for our poorest citizens, and encourage new opportunities in rural communities. The bill also makes critical investments in agricultural trade and research. I will talk about the long-term policy changes in a moment, but I want to mention a critical amendment sponsored by Senator Baucus. The Baucus amendment provides assistance to farmers and ranchers who have been hard hit by drought and other weather events in the last year. I worked with Senator Cantwell to include $100 million in market loss assistance for apple growers in the amendment. I am very pleased the Senate voted 69-31 in favor of the amendment, and I will work to keep it in the final bill. This Farm Bill passed by the Senate today will restore an effective safety net for many of our Nation's farmers. For the last several years, I have heard concerns from farmers in Washington State who grow wheat, barley, dry peas, lentils and chickpeas. They believe, as I do, that the 1996 Farm Bill failed to meet the needs of producers and rural communities. The strongest proponents of the 1996 Farm Bill argued that if we gave producers more flexibility, created the best agricultural research system in the world, and opened foreign markets, our farmers would thrive in the global marketplace. I strongly supported more flexibility in our commodity programs. And I have strongly supported efforts to improve our research infrastructure and expand and open foreign markets. But our actions were not enough. Congress could not wave a magic wand and create a rational world market for agricultural products. The commodity title of the 1996 Farm Bill was written for a world that simply did not, and does not, exist. This year, in this Farm Bill, Congress has the opportunity to write a commodity title that works. And Senator Harkin and the Senate Agriculture Committee did just that. Wheat and barley producers in Washington State will benefit from a strong safety net that includes a good balance between higher loan rates, fixed payments, and countercyclical payments when market prices fall below target prices. In addition, the bill includes a new marketing assistance loan program for dry peas, lentils, and chickpeas. I applaud this provision in the bill. It will help restore market-based decisions and make it economical for producers across the northern-tier States to grow these important rotational crops. I have been pleased to work with my dry pea, lentil, and chickpea growers in Washington State on this important issue. I believe it is critical, and I urge, the conferees to retain this provision in the final bill. The Senate Farm Bill makes critical investments in conservation. The conservation title creates new opportunities to conserve resources on private lands while helping farmers and ranchers with their bottom lines. The conservation title of this bill gradually increases funding for the Environmental Quality Incentives Program from its existing authorization of $200 million a year to $1.5 billion each year. EQIP is an effective and flexible tool. It provides technical, financial, and educational assistance to producers to build animal waste management facilities, improve irrigation efficiency, or enhance wildlife habitat. The EQIP funding included in this bill will help us improve water quality and salmon habitat in the Pacific Northwest. The bill also includes commonsense increases for the Conservation Reserve Program and the Wetlands Reserve Program. While I recognize there are some concerns in farm country with expanding these programs, I believe the CRP and WRP provisions in this bill are reasonable. The bill includes a new water conservation program within CRP. I believe this program will lead to new opportunities to protect fish and wildlife, while respecting the rights of our farmers and ranchers. As the bill goes to conference, I look forward to working with interested organizations on this issue. Finally, the conservation title expands our investments in the Farmland Protection Program, the Wildlife Habitat Improvement Program, the Resource Conservation and Development Program, establishes a new Conservation Security Program, and improves forestry initiatives. The conservation changes made in this bill are particularly important to States like Washington. The farmers in my State produce approximately 230 commodities. However, only a fraction of these commodities have a direct income or price support relationship with the Federal Government. Without new investments in the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, the Conservation Reserve Program, and the Conservation Security Program, many farmers and ranchers would not receive the financial help they need to make the conservation investments the public is demanding. This bill creates a win-win situation for the environment and for farmers and ranchers. I believe Congress also has a responsibility to create a win-win situation for our farmers and ranchers with respect to trade. One way we can do this is to invest in trade promotion programs that will help our farmers build marketshare in foreign countries. In 1999, and again in 2001, I introduced the Agricultural Market Access and Development Act. My legislation would increase funding in the Market Access Program to $200 million and enhance funding for the Foreign Market Development Program. I was joined on that legislation by a bipartisan coalition of members. The Senate Farm Bill includes substantial new investments in the Market Access Program and the Foreign Market Development Program, and I was pleased to be the leading advocate in the Senate to enhance these programs. Congress also has a responsibility to allow all commodity groups to participate in our foreign food aid programs. I worked to include a small provision in the Farm Bill that requires the U.S. Department of Agriculture to issue a report on the use of perishable commodities, like potatoes and apples, in foreign food aid programs. Specifically, my amendment requires USDA to report to the Congress on transportation and storage infrastructure problems and funding problems that have prevented greater participation in the programs by specialty crops. Just recently, 110,000 boxes of apples arrived in Vladivostok, Russia. This is the first time USDA has funded a shipment of perishable commodities through our foreign food aid programs. I believe our fruit and vegetable producers deserve an opportunity to participate in these initiatives, and I believe this report will be an important first step in improving access to these programs. The Farm Bill includes additional provisions that I believe will help our farmers and ranchers. The first would require country-of-origin labeling for fruits and vegetables, meat, and farm-raised fish and shellfish. We require our farmers and ranchers to meet environmental and food safety standards that are far above many of our competitors. Country-of-origin labeling will give consumers additional information with which to make a decision on the food they buy. The second provision would allow the Federal Government to guarantee private loans to Cuba for the purchase of U.S. agricultural products. For too long, the United States has used food as a weapon against the Cuban people. The only person that has benefitted from this policy is Fidel Castro. I strongly support the Committee's bill with respect to Cuba, and I was pleased to join with my colleagues in defeating an amendment to eliminate these new financing tools. Trade is critical to the long-term future of our agricultural producers. One other long-term investment we need to make is in the area of agricultural research. In my home State, we are fortunate to have an excellent working relationship between our State universities and the USDA Agricultural Research Service. Through these partnerships, our universities and USDA have been able to leverage limited resources to create new varieties of crops, enhance food safety and improve conservation. This research benefits farmers, consumers, and the environment. I am pleased that this Farm Bill strengthens our research infrastructure and increases funding for priority research initiatives. One program that is of particular significance to researchers in Washington State is the Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems, and I am pleased the Senate bill includes additional funding for it. The Farm Bill goes far beyond agriculture and conservation. It is a critical vehicle for helping communities and the poor. Senator Harkin has always been a leader in rural development, and this Farm Bill shows how seriously he takes this issue. Included in the managers' amendment is a provision I authored on rural telecommunications planning. It would simply modify the broadband telecommunications grant program in the bill to add a small planning component. I will work to include this and other rural telecommunications provisions in the final bill. I would like to complete my remarks by commending Senators Harkin and Lugar for their efforts in writing a strong nutrition title in this Farm Bill. Both the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Committee have an outstanding record on these issues. During debate on the Farm Bill, I was pleased to support amendments that further strengthened the food stamp program changes included in the bill. The underlying bill made significant improvements to the food stamp program. It provides three more months of transition food stamps for families moving off welfare. It simplifies the program for State administrators and participating families.

Federal Express had nothing to do with the dropping of the language when we passed the ICC termination bill last December. We made that mistake. We are on trial. And this distortion: coming in here and flyblowing a wonderful company-- ``antiworker,'' ``a Republican attack,'' ``slash Medicare,'' ``slash education''--none of that has anything to do with it. Let us assume that Federal Express was antiworker. That would have nothing to do with this particular issue. What we did here with my amendment--and incidentally, ``Republican,'' I have been a Democrat since 1948. I think you were just learning to drive at that time. So you can't define who is a Democrat, we will see how the Democrats vote. At that particular time we came in here and we said, ``Wait a minute. When we left, we had a hearing. Been having a hearing quite regularly all over.'' Who is to be heard? Not the merits of workers' rights, the merits of the truth. Find somebody, some Senator, some Congressman. I have challenged him now for 3 days during this filibuster, find me anybody who says otherwise than that it was an honest mistake. It is our duty to try to correct it. Every time we try, we go down the list, filibuster, filibuster, filibuster. Yes, you have the political power. You have held the whole Congress up for 3 days. Every time we try to get it anywhere, you are going to filibuster, filibuster, filibuster, trying to take advantage of an honest mistake. We have heard from all the Congressmen, Republican and Democrat, all the Senators, Republican and Democrat, and we all agree that it was a mistake. You cannot find anybody who says it was not a mistake. To come in here trying to correct an honest mistake, and they flyblow a company with antiworker/Medicare/Medicaid and all that extraneous garbage--they know no shame. We are not going to filibuster.

On September 21, 2005, with representatives of the school watching from the House gallery, I proudly rose to recognize the 80th anniversary of Cathedral High School in my district. Cathedral and other Catholic schools in El Paso and throughout our country offer a quality education and produce men and women committed to a broader idea of learning--one that extends beyond just textbooks. Catholic schools offer--in more than one sense--a value-added approach to education. They instill in their students a moral compass, a sense of purpose, and a commitment to service. Indeed, many of the men and women who inspired me to spend my life in public service were themselves encouraged to enter that field by the virtues conveyed through Catholic education. I count among that group Ambassador Raymond Telles, the first Hispanic mayor of EI Paso, an American ambassador, an advisor to presidents, and a man whose success in life was built in large part upon the ideals he learned at Cathedral High School. Today, Catholic schools teach 2.5 million young Americans, almost 15 percent of whom are not Catholics. This resolution reaffirms the House of Representatives' support for the countless Catholic school teachers and administrators who dedicate their lives to a particular vision of education, and for the values of love, charity, and hope that are tenets of a Catholic education.

One reason being, Mr. Speaker, when we began this debate I was fascinating myself with the question of how could anybody oppose this bill. These are the four complaints I have heard: One, there seems to be a concern that the bill is being rushed to the floor. The gentleman from California just pointed out, the President of the United States for a long time did not adopt this idea. It had been proposed by many people, and many Democrats. Only after seeing the thorough need and the thorough possibilities for success did the President in June propose Homeland Defense. This House of Representatives worked on it, and with the Select Committee working in consultation with all the committees of jurisdiction in this House, with testimony taken from the chairman and ranking member of each of these committees, produced the bill that was brought to this floor and passed on July 23 with 295 votes. We have waited on the other body; and only after an exhaustive wait did the President propose, insist, last week that we move forward, and now it appears that both bodies will. Pursuant to the President's insistence of last week, we have worked literally night and day in consultation with all the committees of jurisdiction in both bodies and with the White House to craft this legislation which today we bring to the floor. In that regard, Mr. Speaker, let me say that we owe an expression of appreciation to so many staff on both sides of the aisle, on both sides of the building and in the White House and the agencies of the government for all of their hard work, night and day, literally, for the last 4 or 5 days. But may I take just a moment for a special thank you. Those men and women who labor on behalf of all of us in the Office of Legislative Counsel are too seldom recognized; and with the indulgence of this body, let me single them out for special appreciation for the efforts they have made. No, this was not rushed to the floor. We worked hard on it; we worked together on it. Virtually every Member of this body and the other body was consulted in some way on some part of this bill. We are told that America does not care about homeland security. Were you not listening? I think they made the point last week. They do care. It is important. We were told that Members did not get to participate. I know of no piece of legislation brought before this body in my 18 years I have been here where there has been more comprehensive, committee-by- committee, subcommittee-by-subcommittee, Member-by-Member participation in the process of preparing the bill. We were told that the bill was being offered for political purposes in anticipation of the next election. Mr. Speaker, let me say as my final point, I know of no time in my 18 years in this body where the principal author of a bill brought to this floor had less interest in the next election than this time here.","word.count":750,"sep11":0.143258426966292,"years":2002.00280898876,"days":2493,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.863883117271007,"Topic 2":0.0168270507077718,"Topic 3":0.015418679963757,"Topic 4":0.00870773156290995,"Topic 5":0.021767488074738,"Topic 6":0.00573379060977064,"Topic 7":0.0105014499710627,"Topic 8":0.0467372761293655,"Topic 9":0.00719689518779197,"Topic 10":0.0032265205218249},{"id":"10620000025842","body":"Jim Sensenbrenner: Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3125, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act.

I am pleased that the Gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Goodlatte, and the Gentleman from Alaska, Mr. Young, were willing to work with me to include language which addresses my concerns about what I believe was an ambiguous section of the bill. I would like to take a moment to explain my concerns and how, through the manager's amendment, these concerns were addressed. The provision exempting gambling on a closed loop system requires both the sender and the receiver to be on Indian lands. This is not limited to the Indian lands on which the game is conducted, therefore, it would allow linking of all Indian lands nationwide. My concern with this language was how multi-Tribal linking could impact individual Tribal/State gaming Compacts. Let me provide an example: If State A's Compact allows for slots, and State B's Compact allows for blackjack and slots, absent clarification, the tribe in State A could argue it can now participate in blackjack. Included in the manager's amendment is additional language on this section to ensure that no Class III gaming activity can occur without the explicit authorization of a Tribal/State Compact. This language does not require Tribes to re-negotiate their Compacts with states; rather it reinforces the Tribal/State Compact. In conclusion, the Indian gaming language has been clarified so that the carefully negotiated Tribal/State compacts are not at risk. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.","word.count":264,"sep11":-1.18258426966292,"years":2000.67696629213,"days":2021,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.100454671962274,"Topic 2":0.0190587703239336,"Topic 3":0.117224278792036,"Topic 4":0.185597278228583,"Topic 5":0.0494542940550455,"Topic 6":0.203790530091647,"Topic 7":0.270861372277694,"Topic 8":0.0492286091117629,"Topic 9":0.00229050809527291,"Topic 10":0.00203968706175114},{"id":"10820030077909","body":"Conrad Burns: Mr. President, thanking my good friend from Wyoming for allowing me to interrupt here, I renew the unanimous consent request with regard to the votes.

This historic agreement was arrived at after years of careful and considerate negotiation from all sectors of interest; environmentalists, fanners, oil industry representatives, and politicians included. Simply stated, it directs the gradual increased production and integration of ethanol and other biofuels--renewable fuel sources--into the U.S. fuel supply. The increase in available alternative fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel are sure to result in a cleaner environment, an ease on supply, and a reduction on the U.S. dependence on foreign oil--a national security imperative. Opponents of the renewable fuels standard have raised the specter of an increase in gas prices as a result of increased ethanol production. Some claim that motorists could pay as much as 4 to 9 cents extra per gallon. However, in parts of the Nation where ethanol constitutes a significant share of the market, over the past 10 years, there has been essentially no difference in price between ethanol and nonethanol gasoline. According to a consulting firm working for the Oxygenated Fuels Association, whose members produce and market MTBE, 70 percent of which is imported--the defeat of the RFS will keep the MTBE market alive--it is 4 to 9.75 cents per gallon. According to the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration it is 5 to less than 1 cent per gallon. The marketplace reality is: 20 years' experience in Nebraska-- $.01 less than ethanol-free gasoline at the pump; 10 years' experience in Minnesota--$.08 less than gasoline at the wholesale level; 1.5 years' experience in California--no essential difference to the public; and 10 years' experience nationwide--no essential difference to the public. The question is which numbers do you believe. Furthermore, the availability of ethanol blends has been shown to drive down the price of all gasoline as a result of market forces. Another false argument against ethanol's we've heard is that producing ethanol consumes nearly as much nonrenewable oil as the ethanol replaces. The latest U.S. Department of Agriculture report demonstrates that ethanol production has a positive energy balance of 1:1.34 and only 17 percent of that energy comes from fossil oil. The bulk of the energy used in fertilizing the crops and to power ethanol production plants comes from natural gas or coal. Additionally, with farmers using more ethanol and biodiesel in their vehicles, and the advance of biorefineries using cellulosic biomass including agricultural and forestry crops and residues, as well as other biomass and animal waste with disposal problems, the use of fossil fuels to produce biofuels could approach zero. Where opponents really miss the point is in their failure to recognize the threat posed to America's national, energy, and economic security by our dangerous dependence on oil imports. In 1999, America was importing over 55 percent of its oil and petroleum products. Just 2 years later, our dependency increased to over 59 percent--and part of those supplies are in jeopardy because of the unpredictability of Saddam Hussien and political instability in other oil-producing nations. Failure to provide an adequate market for ethanol is a major factor in preventing the emergence of biofuels made from cellulosic biomass. The renewable fuels standard is critical to advance biorefinery technology that will produce urgently needed refined, domestic, renewable, and clean burning biofuels. The biorefineries, very small compared to oil refineries, will be well disbursed throughout the country and much less prone to terrorists' attacks. Opponents wail about a monopoly in the ethanol industry and that only a small group of producers will benefit from the renewable fuels standard. This is inaccurate on two fronts. Essentially all the ethanol and biodiesel plants under construction and in planning phases are smaller plants owned by cooperatives and community enterprises. More importantly, the RFS will provide the impetus to launch the construction of biorefineries across the Nation. Some perceive the RFS as a targeted massive Federal Government subsidy to benefit only farm belt States. In fact, the renewable fuels standard will encourage technology advancements that could be located and employed in any region of the United States, not just the ``corn states.'' It will enhance the Nation's economy, surely in agriculture- based economies, but also through support industries, new jobs, research and development, and opening new markets for agriculture products. This may displays existing ethanol plants, plants under construction and ethanol, biodiesel, and other biofuels plants under consideration. As you can see, with the renewable fuels standard, biorefineries will soon be operating in most State of the Nation. There is no question that the renewable fuels standard will reduce our dependence on foreign oil. It will slow the deterioration of the environment through the reduction of fossil fuel emission and spills, enhance national, energy and economic security, create a new industrial base with tens of thousands of new, high quality jobs, and strengthen homeland security by providing hundreds, perhaps thousands, of community-oriented biorefineries producing biofuels, biochemicals, and bioelectricity. There are those who believe that ethanol's current tax incentives are sufficient, and obviate the need for the renewable fuels standard calling for an expanding market for biofuels. For the past 10 years the price of ethanol was generally below the price of 87 octane at both the wholesale and the retail levels. At current capacity, there is a surplus of ethanol driving wholesale price of ethanol well below the wholesale price of gasoline. On April 11 of this year, the wholesale price of gasoline in New York was 84 cents while the national average cost of wholesale ethanol was 55 cents. If ethanol was available in New York City gasoline today, the price to the consumer should be considerably less than ethanol-free gasoline. I say should because the ethanol industry is always at the pricing mercy of the gasoline marketers. Routinely, the octane value of the ethanol accrues to the gasoline industry not to the ethanol producers. Again, historically, the availability of ethanol in the marketplace drives down the cost of all gasoline because of market forces. According to the Society of Independent Gasoline Marketers of America, Then there is the issue of the overall cost of the ethanol industry. Opponents claim that the cost of the program exceeds the benefits. This is refuted by a recent study: the Economic Analysis of Legislation for a Renewable Fuels Requirement for Highway Motor Fuels, conducted by AUS Consultants. It will displace 1.6 billion barrels of oil over the next decade; reduce our trade deficit by $34.1 billion; increase new investment in rural communities by more than $5.3 billion; boost the demand for feed grains and soybeans by more than 1.5 billion bushels over the next decade; create more than 214,000 new jobs throughout the U.S. economy; and expand household income by an additional $51.7 billion over the next decade. The RFS in this bill represents a continuation of sound public policy supporting the biofuels industry that has brought benefits to the Nation over the past quarter a century. Two States are showing us the way--Minnesota and Nebraska. We can also look to the major advances being made in Europe and Brazil. I am unabashedly proud of what my home State has accomplished. The formation of the National Governors' Ethanol Coalition was one of the important steps. Nebraska and several other Midwestern States created this coalition that now consists of 26 States and one U.S. territory, as well as Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and Sweden. Since its formation in 1991, the Governors' Ethanol Coalition has worked to expand national and international markets for biofuels. American firms are working with India, Thailand, Colombia, and other countries to help them establish biofuels industries. Within the State of Nebraska, during the period from 1991-2001, seven ethanol plants were constructed and several of these facilities were expanded more than once during the decade. Specific benefits of the ethanol program in Nebraska include: $1.15 billion in new capital investment in ethanol processing plants. 1,005 permanent jobs at the ethanol facilities and 5,115 induced jobs directly related to plant construction, operation, and maintenance. Average salaries at the ethanol processing facilities range from $38,000-$56,000 depending on geographic location. The permanent jobs generate an annual payroll of $44 million. More than 210 million bushels of corn and grain sorghum is processed at the plants annually. Economists at Purdue University and the USDA estimate that the price of corn increases from 9.9 cents-10 cents per bushel for every 100 million bushels of new demand. Local price basis increases in Nebraska range from 5-15 cents. The trend of marketing wet distillers grains for cattle feeding generates at least $41 million in increased economic activity annually according to a 1999 report by the University of Nebraska. Of the $41 million increase, 85 percent accrues to cattle feeders in the form of reduced costs and increased gains, and 15 percent accrues to the plants. Local tax bases are more diversified in areas where plants are located. Several smaller communities have experienced increases in housing construction and new business start-ups associated with services related to plant operations. Jobs among the skilled trades have increased. Pipe fitters, steamfitters, steel workers, and construction engineering trades are involved in plant construction. Value is added to grain processed at ethanol plants. Today, a $2.00 bushel of corn is processed","word.count":1906,"sep11":0.615168539325843,"years":2002.47471910112,"days":2661,"party":"Other","chamber":"","Topic 1":0.157607909874755,"Topic 2":0.404696379885054,"Topic 3":0.102977561265858,"Topic 4":0.0471922093058685,"Topic 5":0.160211873426076,"Topic 6":0.0107632060182314,"Topic 7":0.00507350739892916,"Topic 8":0.0807475670986491,"Topic 9":0.00746114940952049,"Topic 10":0.0232686363170578},{"id":"10720010070382","body":"Susan Collins: Thank you, Mr. President Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Texas and my colleague from Maryland for their extraordinary leadership in shining the spotlight on a very dark, dark part of the Earth.

Res. 923, which recognizes the 150th anniversary of the State of Minnesota and highlights its contributions to America's economy and heritage. H. Res. 923 was introduced by our colleague, Congresswoman Michelle Bachmann of Minnesota, on January 16, 2008, and was considered by and reported from the Oversight Committee on May 1, 2008, by voice vote. This measure has the support and cosponsorship of 120 Members of Congress, including all of the Members from the State of Minnesota. On March 2, 1849, Minnesota was established as a territory, and it became the 32nd State on March 11, 1858. Also known as the Gopher State, the North Star State, and the Land of 10,000 Lakes, Minnesota's name comes from the Dakota word ``minesota,'' meaning ``water that reflects the sky.'' Minnesota has been and continues to be a leader in innovation in science and education. It is home of the Mayo Clinic, which is known for its cutting-edge medical work, and over 30 institutions of higher education, including the University of Minnesota, a world-class research university, which performed the first open heart surgery and the first bone marrow transplant in America. I should also mention that Minnesota is currently home to more than 35 Fortune 500 companies and is leading the Nation in the production and use of renewable energy. So, Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentlewoman from Minnesota for sponsoring the measure at hand. Given the 150th anniversary of Minnesota's statehood and the enormous contributions Minnesota has made to our Nation and the world, I urge passage of this resolution.

Mica: Mr. Speaker, I come before the House today to again call on the Speaker and House leadership to bring forward the contempt citation against Mr. Quinn, legal counsel to the President, and other White House officials who have been involved in keeping documents relating to ``Filegate'' from the Congress and also from the Special Counsel. I serve on the committee charged with the jurisdiction of investigations and oversight. It is the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight. We have been investigating this matter now for over 2 years. We have requested files for over 2 years. The pattern of evasiveness, the pattern of deceit by the White House in keeping these records both again from the Congress, the Special Counsel, and our committee is abhorrent. Let me just cite from our report, the contempt proceedings that were offered to the House, some of the facts relating to this matter. This all deals with Travelgate which our subcommittee was investigating. Weeks after the firings of 7 long-time White House Travel Office employees, President William J. Clinton staved off a congressional inquiry into the growing controversy by committing to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jack Brooks on July 13, 1993, and this is what the President said: ``You can be assured that the Attorney General will have the administration's full cooperation in investigating those matters which the Department wishes to review.'' No mention then of executive privilege from the President on withholding documents from the investigators. In fact this is quite unprecedented. Even in Irangate, President Reagan offered all materials to congressional investigators. This is almost unprecedented, and again an issue that does not deal with foreign policy or national policy but is an investigation of the conduct within the White House, that this information is kept from us. This is what the President said in January 1996, this year. He stated, ``We've told everybody we're in the cooperation business. That's what we want to do. We want to get this over with.'' Yet we still have not, as of this day, gotten one-third of the documents relating to this matter. Let me read really the essence of what this is about, and let me quote from notes from a White House aide that we obtained just recently this year, dated May 27, 1993. This is the date of the document. White House Management Review author Todd Stern wrote this. This is not the Republicans, this is a White House operative. He said: ``Problem is that if we do any kind of report and fail to address those questions, the press jumps on you wanting to know answers; while if you give answers that aren't fully honest, e.g., nothing re: HRC''--Hillary Rodham Clinton, he uses the initials--``you risk hugely compounding the problem by getting caught in half-truths. You run the risk of turning this into a cover-up.'' Now, I did not say this. Our committee did not say this. No Republican said this. This is a White House aide. We see why they have kept these documents from us. The fact is that two-thirds of the documents we sought, were sought by a bipartisan subpoena, have been withheld from the Congress by the White House. The fact is, we now know why the White House has stonewalled the Congress. The fact is, the White House in this case misused the IRS and the FBI, the chief law enforcement agency of this Nation, in an incredible abuse of power. The fact is, and this will come out, the civil rights, the privacy rights, the Hatch Act, all of these laws I believe we will find have been violated. These are the rights and the privacy of past and present Federal employees. One of the most egregious violations is that they obtained the files of three of our staff directors of our Investigations, and Oversight Committee, the one on which I serve. The fact is that more than 2,000 pages of documents are still being kept from the Congress, from the media, from the Special Counsel relating to this matter. I call on the Speaker, I call on Chairman Clinger, I call on the House leadership to bring forward to the floor of the House of Representatives this contempt citation. We must vote on it, and we must find Mr. Quinn and officials at the White House in contempt of Congress for their actions in this matter.","word.count":733,"sep11":-5.36797752808989,"years":1996.49157303371,"days":531,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0147718230135715,"Topic 2":0.162240401249585,"Topic 3":0.00263520402284205,"Topic 4":0.338917064512075,"Topic 5":0.00157609469995882,"Topic 6":0.00143638163520132,"Topic 7":0.0080063649242953,"Topic 8":0.00281984686067934,"Topic 9":0.465099683857564,"Topic 10":0.00249713522422711},{"id":"10519980027221","body":"Robert Andrews: Mr. Speaker, I thank the minority whip for yielding this time to me.

We are very proud of that because we may have more creative individuals in our area than perhaps any other community of the world. Some say that everyone who lives there is either a musician or a songwriter, and some just haven't cut their demos yet. We are very proud of that musical tradition and heritage, and we believe music should be included in the curriculum in our public schools. Music education is vitally important, not only for the reasons that my two colleagues have given, and I would also like to thank the original cosponsor of this legislation, the gentleman from California for his strong support. Music education I think is even more important than the reasons that have been given so far. When our Founders started talking about the values of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, surely in the pursuit of happiness, they were talking about music. Music is literally the joy of life, the soundtrack of our lives. It accompanies our most important and most intimate moments. Whether it is a tune or a lyric that you carry in your heart forever, that is an important part of being fully human. It is also an important part of our educational system. A shocking number of our young people, some 30 million or more, are being deprived of this music education. They are being deprived of a well-rounded education. Many Americans have seen the movie called ``Mr. Holland's Opus'' in which Richard Dreyfuss played a high school music teacher who did a superb job over decades teaching young people how to play an instrument in a band, how to appreciate music, and develop their minds and hearts to the fullest extent. Of course in that movie, Mr. Holland's job was terminated because the local school board did not think music was important. They considered it a luxury rather than a necessity. But I think all thinking Americans realize music is important, it is not a luxury, it is a necessity, and it is very important for our young people to learn those skills. The music historian Jules Combarieu said, ``Music is the art of thinking with sounds.'' I hope that all of our young people will be able to learn to think with sounds and learns how to play a musical instrument. The International Music Products Association deserves a lot of credit for helping focus our attention during this month on the needs of our students who need the ability to learn a musical instrument. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the many Members of this House who strongly support this resolution. I would like to thank the members of this committee who brought forward this measure with unusual speed using an unconventional mechanism, and we appreciate the recognition of music as a key part of our public education. However, it is very important that we do not just pay lip service to this goal because there is no funding in this bill. This is a concurrent resolution. This just encourages, this just asks the many school districts around the country to include music as a priority. Let us make it real. Let us make sure that our public schools do have music education in the curriculum and that all of our children around this great Nation have the chance to learn the sound of music.","word.count":590,"sep11":2.71348314606742,"years":2004.57303370787,"days":3408,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0553964288091808,"Topic 2":0.344761525337228,"Topic 3":0.00753951375936047,"Topic 4":0.00665352159118526,"Topic 5":0.55399769521848,"Topic 6":0.00300532042944726,"Topic 7":0.00191356791149414,"Topic 8":0.015911635462868,"Topic 9":0.00273685853676136,"Topic 10":0.00808393294399393},{"id":"10920060000212","body":"Sander Levin: Mr. Speaker, last night the President of the United States said, ``Wise policies such as welfare reform have made a difference in the character of our country.''

It is not our definition, it is CBO's and I quote from a letter of January 31 to Mr. Rangel: ``As requested by your staff, CBO has reviewed the child support provisions in the conference agreement for S. 1932, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, and we have determined that those provisions contain an intergovernmental mandate as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act.''

This legislation will exempt these products, as well as coffee and tea, from proposed new regulations that would needlessly and inadvertently require their containers to be individually marked with country of origin. These labeling requirements are unnecessary because the coffee, tea and spices under consideration, with one exception, are not manufactured in the United States and therefore do not offer consumers the option to purchase domestically-grown alternatives. The one exception is not processed in such a way as to fall under the new regulations, so it will be unaffected by this legislation. This bill, supported by the House Ways and Means Committee, was included in the House's version of the budget reconciliation bill, but was excluded under Senate rules. The legislation is also supported by the U.S. Treasury Department, which issued the regulations but requires legislative language to except these three areas. Finally, my bill is supported by coffee, tea, and spice importers. Without this legislation, regulations calling for country of origin markings ultimately would require extremely costly record keeping and marking of individual jars and canisters of products which are often mixes of nearly identical products from different countries and different parts of the world. The countries of origin vary quite often due to market prices and availability.

On that day, and in the following months, thousands worked and lived by the Ground Zero site, amidst the dust, smog, and toxic mix of debris. And now we are seeing those workers, responders, and residents become sick from what they were exposed to on 9/11 and the following months. I believe we have a moral obligation to take care of those suffering from 9/11-related illnesses. The work of Senator Harkin, Senator Byrd, Senator Specter, and all of their colleagues on the Senate Appropriations Committee has been invaluable in securing funding to address many of the health issues that have appeared following 9/11. In December 2001, we learned that hundreds of firefighters were on medical leave because of injuries related to 9/11 issues, and the Appropriations Committee responded by allocating $12 million for medical monitoring activities so that we could track and study the health impacts associated with the rescue and response efforts at the World Trade Center. Thousands of individuals signed up for this program, and in Congress, we worked to meet the demand by appropriating an additional $90 million to monitor other workers and volunteers who were at Ground Zero and Fresh Kills. Through this work, we learned that many of those who were exposed are now experiencing significant health problems from this exposure--people who were in the prime of their life before 9/11 now suffering from asthma, sinusitis, reactive airway disease, and mental health issues. So in December 2005, I worked with Senator Harkin and other appropriators, as well as my colleagues in the New York Congressional Delegation, to secure an additional $75 million in funding that would for the first time provide Federal funding for treatment to help those who were disabled by these attacks get the care that they needed. Sadly, we are once again running out of funding to take care of the heroes who never questioned their responsibility on 9/11 and are now paying a terrible price. While the President has proposed providing additional funding for treatment in the fiscal year 2008 budget, we must act sooner to provide sufficient funds to ensure treatments through the rest of the current fiscal year. That is why I introduced an amendment to the 9/11 bill we are considering today to divert $3.6 million in funding--originally part of that $20 billion secured for New York in the wake of 9/11 that the administration proposed to cut in its fiscal year 2008 budget. At a time when treatment needs are so urgent, I believe that we need to ensure that dollars that were intended for 9/11 needs can be used to address the mounting health crisis that we are facing as a direct result of these attacks. I believe it is important to raise awareness of the fact that these programs--programs that are helping tens of thousands of first responders in New York and around the Nation--are in danger of having to turn patients away. I am extremely grateful for what we have been able to accomplish with the support of Senator Harkin and other appropriators. They have shown that they consider it our national responsibility to care for those who did our country proud in the hours, days, weeks, and months following that horrific attack. I am also proud that I will be working with my colleagues on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, including Senators Kennedy, Enzi, and Harkin, to develop a lasting solution to address these health care needs. But while we are working on those solutions, we must ensure that these programs continue to operate.","word.count":632,"sep11":5.62640449438202,"years":2007.48595505618,"days":4445,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0595244556962553,"Topic 2":0.329171855371917,"Topic 3":0.337229910480633,"Topic 4":0.0113860235943217,"Topic 5":0.0146746238689855,"Topic 6":0.0205425981741151,"Topic 7":0.0112806906912251,"Topic 8":0.0238761395727366,"Topic 9":0.178644829477413,"Topic 10":0.0136688730723975},{"id":"10519980025271","body":"Wally Herger: Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word Mr. Chairman, it has come to my understanding that after debating this issue the gentlewoman from Oregon is going to pull her amendment without allowing it to go for a vote. I understand why the gentlewoman is not going to let this come to a vote. She clearly does not have the votes in the House to support this extreme radical measure. For years we have argued and debated over possible corporate welfare within the Forest Service road credit purchaser program. As of this year, this program no longer exists. Now we learn the argument was really not over the road credit purchaser program but was really over the extremist agenda of advocating zero cut on our national forests, a euphemism for which is below-cost timber sales. This policy strips the Forest Service of its single most effective tool for maintaining forest health and reducing the risk of catastrophic fire. The Forest Service estimates that more than 40 million acres of our national forests are threatened with destruction by catastrophic wildfire. With a full range of management options, the Forest Service can reduce this threat of catastrophic fire. I would like to ask my colleagues which of these two forests that we have pictures of would they want for their children? On the left we see a forest that is not managed. Now, I might mention that I represent a district in northern California that has 11 national forests in it. I have examples of both of these forests within my district. Again, the picture on the left is an unmanaged forest. We know a lot about all the rain we have been receiving, at least in California, this year. What we do not remember, sometimes we forget that of the last 12 years, 7 of those 12 years have been drought years. California, unlike so much of the rest of the Nation, is a desert during the summertime, and when there is this competition for moisture, what we see is this unnatural type of state that we see on the left. Without the ability to be able to go in and thin these forests out and remove the dead and dying timber, what we will see, rather than the forest on the right, which is a managed forest, where we remove dead and dying timbers, what we see is a situation like this. In 1994, in the United States, we had 5 million acres of timber that burned; that were catastrophic; where there is nothing left. In 1996 we had 6 million acres burned. So it is really up to us. Are we going to manage our forests in a prudent way or are we going to allow them to burn, as we see in this picture to my left? I am very pleased, again, that the gentlewoman from Oregon has removed this very ill thought out amendment of hers, but I believe it is time that we begin to bring balance to the management of our forests and not allow the extreme environmentalists to run it by politics.","word.count":519,"sep11":-3.2247191011236,"years":1998.63483146067,"days":1294,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.309954234058303,"Topic 2":0.0672594166491639,"Topic 3":0.0410723887837882,"Topic 4":0.0181122581783152,"Topic 5":0.0801767345079374,"Topic 6":0.0048074937600177,"Topic 7":0.0094535893356908,"Topic 8":0.0134038439579571,"Topic 9":0.451836053818106,"Topic 10":0.00392398695072012},{"id":"10619990043860","body":"Bill Young: Without objection, it is so ordered","word.count":383,"sep11":-1.8623595505618,"years":1999.99719101124,"days":1779,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.225478896241187,"Topic 2":0.305777100432564,"Topic 3":0.00887617767915597,"Topic 4":0.00736481403569179,"Topic 5":0.418664706325606,"Topic 6":0.00719674314528632,"Topic 7":0.00351798932760864,"Topic 8":0.0144860500373743,"Topic 9":0.00362185333469328,"Topic 10":0.00501566944083136},{"id":"10619990004176","body":"Roy Blunt: Mr. Chairman, last year the Republicans in the House of Representatives beat their chests mightily to talk about a $792 billion tax cut over 10 years. That tax cut was so fiscally irresponsible that it was rejected throughout the country. We are back this year with the same situation, except now we will not even talk about it. In our Committee on the Budget hearing I asked our chairman, what was the price tag over 10 years for this tax cut? I could not get a straight answer. But today, I understand that number has been put out here before the body. It is $200 billion over 5 years. Now, the question that the public deserves to have the answer to here, and we ought to answer it for ourselves, is what is the 10-year cost of this tax cut? Well, last year the $792 billion tax cut was $156 billion over 5 years. We are talking about $200 billion over 5 years. So the math is pretty simple. We are looking at a $1 trillion tax cut over 10 years. Now, there are those up here that think we ought to use the projected surplus for massive tax cuts and some that want to go on a spending spree, and I reject both positions. We should take the lion's share of the projected surplus and use it to pay down this massive Federal debt. Why should we focus on paying down a $3.47 trillion Federal debt? Consider these facts: in 1999, we spent $230 billion in interested payments, 13 percent of our discretionary spending. That is $3,644 per every family in America with four people. That is more than we spend on Medicare; it is slightly less than what we spent on national defense. Think of the things that we could do by paying down the debt and not having that interest payment. We can do a responsible tax cut. We spent $60 billion last year on education. We spent $230 billion in interest payments. Paying down the debt has also been an offense to our wallets at home. Several economists, including the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, have said, that as we pay down the debt it has a positive impact on interest rates, as much as 2 points. Take a homeowner in my home State of Florida with a $115,000 mortgage. If his or her interest rate goes down by 2 points, that is a reduction of $155 a month in their mortgage payment. That is a better benefit than most of the tax cuts that are being proposed up here. Mr. Chairman, let us stop playing games with the future of America. This budget is not a responsible step towards paying down the debt and extending the solvency of Social Security and Medicare. In fact, under this plan, the Social Security surplus will be spent as early as 2004. The public does not want gargantuan tax cuts at the expense of paying down the debt and preserving Social Security and Medicare, and we should reject the resolution for that reason.","word.count":349,"sep11":-2.5561797752809,"years":1999.30337078652,"days":1532,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.017809986200279,"Topic 2":0.489781239596349,"Topic 3":0.0258073372754699,"Topic 4":0.00686323229485743,"Topic 5":0.1336429271602,"Topic 6":0.111422049087942,"Topic 7":0.0143921711982841,"Topic 8":0.181079738413757,"Topic 9":0.0107785944752851,"Topic 10":0.00842272429757564},{"id":"10419960010648","body":"J.D.

I have been informed--and I ask colleagues whether this is, in fact, the case--that there is actually another bill, not 342 pages long but 491 pages long, that will be laid down this afternoon by Senator Boxer. It is very difficult for any of us to be prepared when the target continues to move. To those who are concerned, as the Senator from California and the majority leader have been about the speed with which we address this bit of legislation, this does nothing but slow us down and make our job harder. I hope that is not the case, but that is what I am reliably informed. To me, it is counterintuitive to say the least that we would undertake to pass legislation with a pricetag of $6.7 trillion that will actually raise gas prices by 147 percent when families in my State and across the country are already paying an extra $1,400 a year for gas prices as a result of congressional inaction. Actually, I guess it is wrong to say congressional inaction because Congress has actually acted to impose a barrier to developing America's natural resources right here at home to the tune of roughly 3 million barrels of oil a day which, if it was made available and Congress would simply get out of the way, that would be additional supply which would bring down the price of oil which would give us some temporary relief as we transition to a clean energy future for our country and for the world. By that I mean by developing things such as greater use of nuclear power, using good old-fashioned American ingenuity, research and development to develop clean coal technology and the like. In the near term, I think we all have to acknowledge the obvious fact that oil is going to continue to be part of our future, but hopefully it will be a bridge to a future of clean energy independence, but not unless Congress acts. Congress is the problem. I suggest when we look around for the causes of our current energy crisis that Congress simply look in the mirror because we are the problem. It is unfortunate that when the Senate had an opportunity recently to vote on the American Energy Production Act that only 42 Senators voted for it. That was when gas was about $3.73 a gallon. Today the average price of a gallon of gas is $3.98 a gallon. I asked the question then, and I will ask it again today: Is the Senate going to reject an opportunity to develop America's natural resources and bring down the price of gasoline at the pump when gasoline is at $3.98 a gallon? How about when it is at $5 a gallon or $6 a gallon? Where is the tipping point at which Congress is finally going to wake up and realize it is the reason Americans are paying too much at the pump? Instead of dealing with that urgent need that affects every man, woman, and child in this country, this Congress has decided to head down another path, and that path is bigger Government, more taxes, higher energy costs for electricity and gasoline, and with the uncertainty that any of this will actually have an impact on climate, especially given the fact that countries such as China and India, of a billion people each, are not going to agree to impose this on themselves. So America is going to do this, presumably, while our major global competitors are not, and we are going to suffer not only those higher prices but job losses, reduction in our gross domestic product, and a competitive disadvantage with the rest of the world. Why would we do that to ourselves? At the same time, we see this Rube Goldberg bureaucracy that would be created. Yesterday, Senator Dorgan said this bureaucracy would make HillaryCare pale in comparison with its complexity as reflected on this chart. This is the kind of huge expansion in Government power over our lives and over the economy that is unprecedented in our country, and I suggest is the wrong solution, is the wrong answer to what confronts us today. In my State in Texas, it has been estimated under that Boxer climate tax legislation that as many as 334,000 jobs would be lost as a result of the increased costs and taxes associated with this bill, with a $52.2 billion loss to the Texas economy, and an $8,000 additional surcharge on each Texas household. That is over and above the $1,400 that each Texas family is already paying because of congressional inaction on oil and gas prices. Electricity costs, 145 percent higher; gasoline, 147 percent higher. I don't know why, at a time when the American people and the American economy are already struggling with a soft economy in many parts of the country, why we would do this to ourselves. It simply does not make any sense to me. I would like to have an explanation from our colleagues who are advocating this particular legislation how they can possibly justify this bill. What could be the possible rationale for legislation that would do this to my State and have this sort of Draconian impact on the economy of our country? I have heard some talk that said that gas prices have increased during the time President Bush has been in office. This is what has happened since our friends on the other side of the aisle have controlled both the House of Representatives and the Senate. We see there is a huge spike in gas prices during a Democratic-controlled Congress. But this should not be a partisan issue. This is a matter of the welfare of the American family and of the American economy. Why in the world would we not want to work together to try to develop the natural resources that God has given us to create that additional 3- million-barrel supply of oil so we can reduce our dependence on imported oil from foreign sources? The alternative proposed by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle is, OK, we are going to impose higher taxes on the oil industry which, of course, would be passed along to consumers and raise the price of gasoline even more or they say we are going to have another investigation into price gouging when the Federal Trade Commission has investigated time and time again and found no evidence to justify a charge of price gouging when it comes to gasoline prices or they say we are going to sue OPEC, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which has to be the most boneheaded suggestion I have heard because, of course, what in the world would you ask the judge to order if you were successful in suing OPEC? I presume to open the spigot even wider so we would be more dependent on foreign oil and not less. It is time for a real solution. This bill is not it. I call on my colleagues to do what we can to open America's natural resources to development and bring down the price of gasoline at the pump. I yield the floor.","word.count":1268,"sep11":6.90449438202247,"years":2008.76404494382,"days":4900,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.42227568707632,"Topic 2":0.233035488814647,"Topic 3":0.057634755920767,"Topic 4":0.0887967607369585,"Topic 5":0.131965500615858,"Topic 6":0.00510853268876588,"Topic 7":0.00420472910141021,"Topic 8":0.0180977934795602,"Topic 9":0.00622939165722346,"Topic 10":0.0326513599084887},{"id":"10720020035778","body":"Dianne Feinstein: Mr. President, I rise on behalf of Senators Fitzgerald, Cantwell, Corzine, Wyden, Leahy, Boxer, and Durbin in modifying our amendment on energy derivatives. As you know, we discussed this issue on the floor before, and the senior Senator from Texas had some concerns. So we spent a good deal of time talking with him and his staff. We have also kept in touch with our cosponsors. We have agreed on some modifications. There are some modifications that the Senator from Texas sought that the cosponsors and I could not agree to. So this modification represents where we agree and not where we disagree. I begin by explaining two terms in the amendment. The first term is ``a derivative.'' A derivative is a financial instrument traded on or off an exchange, the price of which is directly dependent upon an underlying commodity, such as natural gas or electricity. An ``over- the-counter'' or ``swap'' contract is an agreement whereby a floating price is exchanged for a fixed price over a specified period. It involves no transfer of physical energy, and both parties settle their contractual obligations in cash. Although energy derivatives make up only 4 percent of all derivative transactions, energy swaps make up 80 percent of all energy derivatives. So these are important terms. What our amendment does is subject electronic exchanges, such as Enron Online, Dynegydirect, and IntercontinentalExchange--these exchanges trade energy derivatives--to the similar oversight reporting and capital requirements as other exchanges, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the New York Mercantile Exchange, and the Chicago Board of Trade. However, since the vast majority of energy derivative transactions are over the counter, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has insufficient authority, at present, to investigate and prevent fraud and price manipulation, and parties making these trades are not required to keep records of their trades. In other words, there is no transparency. There is no record and there is no oversight of these particular trades. So our amendment simply requires these parties to keep records of their transactions, which is what most companies do in any event. If it turns out there is a fraud allegation, the CFTC will have a record to review. This is the same fraud and manipulation authority the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has for every other commodity and it is the same authority they had until Congress passed the Commodity Futures Modernization Act in 2000. That act exempted energy and metals trading from regulatory oversight, and excluded it completely if the trade was done electronically. Before this act, it was all included. Following the act, it was excluded. That was around June of 2000. The problem and why we need this legislation: Presently, energy transactions--those about which I am not speaking, but the other energy transactions--are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission when there is actually a delivery of the energy commodity. What do I mean? If I buy natural gas from you, and you deliver that natural gas to me, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has the authority to ensure that this transaction is both transparent and reasonably priced. In other words, FERC has regulatory authority when the energy is actually delivered. However, energy transactions have become increasingly complex over the past decade. So, today, energy transactions do not always result in a direct delivery, and thus a giant loophole has opened where there is no transparency, no records, and no oversight. And that is not when I sell it to you to deliver it but when I sell it to you and you sell it to somebody else, who sells it to somebody else, who sells it to somebody else, and then it is delivered. Those interim trades are in no way, shape, or form transparent. They are done in secret. There is no oversight and there is no record. So I can purchase from you a derivatives contract, which is a promise that you will deliver natural gas to me at some point in the future. I may never need to physically own that gas, so I can at a small profit sell that gas to someone, who can then turn around and sell it yet to someone else, and so on and so forth, as I have just pointed out. The promise of a gas delivery can literally change hands dozens of times before the commodity is ever delivered. Even then, it may never get delivered if the spot market price is lower than the future price that comes due on that day. That is what I meant about saying it is very complicated. In fact, about 90 percent of the energy trades represent purely financial transactions, not regulated by either the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or the CFTC. So as long as there is no delivery, there is no price transparency. We do not know the price or the terms for 90 percent of the energy transactions. Let me repeat that. Today, no one knows the price or the terms for 90 percent of the energy transactions. Again, this lack of transparency and oversight only applies to energy. It does not apply if you are selling wheat or pork bellies or any other tangible commodity. As I said, there is a very big loophole here. What we seek to do is simply close that loophole. How did this happen? The answer is, the Commodity Futures Modernization Act, signed into law in 2000, exempted energy and minerals trading from regulatory oversight and also exempted electronic trading platforms from oversight. That is the online trading that occurs. In a sense, what the legislation did was set up two different systems: treating electronic trading platforms differently from other platforms, and treating energy commodities different from other commodities. Up until 2000, energy derivative transactions were regulated in a similar fashion to other transactions, and all energy transactions were subject to antifraud and antimanipulation oversight. Electronic trading platforms were treated like all other platforms. These were the standards that were in place until June of 2000. Up until that time, if a gas or electricity commodity was delivered, FERC had oversight, and there was transparency; if there was not delivery, the CFTC had the authority. So the loophole arose just 2 years ago. At the time of the 2000 legislation, no one knew how the exemptions would affect the energy market. It was a new market. They wanted to see growth. So they kind of unleashed it and said: All this can go on without the light of day. We have a much better idea today because of what we have learned since then. It didn't take long for Enron Online and others in the energy sector to take advantage of this new freedom--and, to an extent, secrecy--by trading energy derivatives absent any regulatory oversight or transparency. Thus, after the 2000 legislation was enacted, Enron Online began to trade energy derivatives bilaterally, over the counter, in a one-to-one transaction, without being subject to any regulatory oversight whatsoever. It should not surprise anyone that, without transparency, prices went right up. Was Enron and its energy derivatives trading arm, Enron Online, the sole reason California and the West had an energy crisis 18 months ago? Of course not. Was it a contributing factor to the crisis? I believe it was. Unfortunately, because of the energy exemptions in the 2000 Commodities Futures Modernization Act, which took away the CFTC's authority to investigate, we may never know for sure since there are no records. For me, this issue comes down to some fundamental questions. Why shouldn't there be transparency in the energy market? Why should the CFTC not have antifraud, antimanipulation authority when there is fraud and manipulation in the market? And why shouldn't California's energy ratepayers and customers and consumers and ratepayers in other States enjoy the same CFTC protections as ranchers and farmers do today? The modification of our amendment results from the discussions my cosponsors and I had with Senator Phil Gramm, who approached us to express his concern that our bill could inadvertently impact financial derivatives. We made several changes to accommodate Senator Gramm's concerns, and we were hopeful we could reach agreement with him. However, there are four additional points where we did not reach agreement: exempting energy swaps from CFTC antifraud and antimanipulation authority; deleting all public price-transparency requirements; exempting all electronic exchanges from requirements that they maintain sufficient capital to carry out their operations, based on risk; and finally, eliminating metal derivatives from oversight. As I said before, energy swaps--this is a point of contention between us--comprise as much as 80 percent of energy derivatives transactions so this change would have taken the teeth out of our amendment. We consulted with our cosponsors. They did not want to agree to it. I believe Senator Fitzgerald is coming to the Chamber to speak to this. Additionally, our amendment states that electronic trading forums should hold capital commensurate with the risk, which seems a reasonable expectation to me. The public can already access information from nonelectronic exchanges simply by picking up the business section of a daily newspaper. I don't understand the rationale for wanting to limit the public's access to data on electronic exchanges. There is ample evidence that fraud and manipulation can occur and have already occurred in the metal sector. This was borne out by several scandals over the past decade, including the 1996 Sumitomo case. In Sumitomo, it was found that U.S. consumers were overcharged $2.5 billion because of a Japanese company's manipulation of the copper markets. These were changes that we simply could not agree to. Why do my cosponsors and I feel so strongly about the need to pass this amendment? First, the debate is nothing new. In November of 1999, the Federal Reserve, the Department of Treasury, the SEC, and the CFTC issued ","word.count":2283,"sep11":0.530898876404494,"years":2002.3904494382,"days":2631,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.340523451981744,"Topic 2":0.026397262401633,"Topic 3":0.0505375684044291,"Topic 4":0.0321571597898285,"Topic 5":0.0357094150396554,"Topic 6":0.0149675668101212,"Topic 7":0.00867958336342288,"Topic 8":0.132134108020604,"Topic 9":0.343550535123261,"Topic 10":0.0153433490653009},{"id":"10419950124802","body":"Don Nickles: Mr. President, I thank both our colleagues from New York for their statements.

Yesterday was the filing deadline, April 15, which comes around every year, and for most Americans it is greeted with a great deal of trepidation and anxiety. April 15 represents the annual call of Uncle Sam, the tax collector, knocking on the doors of hard-working taxpayers, and it highlights the real tax burden that is placed on American families. This year, Americans will work 74 days to pay their Federal taxes, 74 days to pay their Federal tax burden alone. In order to pay State and local taxes, Americans will work an average of 39 additional days. What that means is that the typical hard-working, taxpaying, law-abiding American in this country will have to work an average of 113 days to pay taxes in 2008. If we look at a calendar, that pretty much takes care of the months of January, February, March, and April, up to the 23rd of this month. If you think about it, every American is still working this year to pay the tax man. They have not gotten to that point in the tax year when everything they make can then be dedicated to the expenses they have for their families, for their children's education, for retirement, for fuel costs--all the things we deal with in our daily lives. We are still at a point on the calendar where none of what we make can be applied to those necessities of life because we are still at a point on the calendar where everything we earn and make in this country is dedicated to paying the tax man. Literally 113 days of the calendar year of this year up until April 23, which will be next week, is dedicated to pay the tax man. What does that mean? Another perspective: If you put it into an 8- hour work day, taxpayers are going to work 1 hour and 37 minutes every single day to pay Federal taxes, and an additional 51 minutes to pay State and local taxes. Put that into perspective. All other categories of consumer spending pale in comparison to the annual tax burden. In fact, Americans only need to work 60 days to pay for annual housing costs, 50 days for health and medical care, 35 days to pay for their annual costs, and 29 days to pay for transportation. So the expenses most people deal with in their every-day lives, whether, again, that is the cost of housing, health care, food, or transportation--all are basic necessities--pale in comparison to the number of days the American taxpayer works every single year to pay their tax burden. That is a pretty remarkable chart, I think you would have to say, when you look at the tax burden and the number of days you have to pay relative to the things we spend the rest of our money on. This year, the statistics are probably better, if you can imagine that, than they were a few years ago. In 2000, before the historic tax cuts took effect, taxpayers had to work an all-time high of 123 days to pay their tax burden. We have gone from 123 days down to 113 days. In that same year 2000, a record 33.6 percent of the Nation's income was dedicated to paying taxes. After the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, Americans were able to work an average of two fewer weeks to meet their Federal tax burden. That is why we find the average American working 113 days to meet their tax liability as opposed to 123 days a few short years ago. That is attributable to the tax relief that was enacted in 2001 and 2003. Aside from paying taxes, filling out tax returns is a burden in and of itself. We have a Tax Code that is out of control, out of date, and is imploding under its own weight. The U.S. Tax Code spans over 54,000 pages. Some of the current provisions of the code were created 40 years ago. Each year individuals, families, and businesses spend needless hours poring over IRS forms and regulations trying to make sense of the endless exercise of filing taxes. In fact, in total, taxpayers dedicate over 6 billion hours to file their taxes and spend over $140 billion a year in compliance costs. I read a story a couple of days ago that those who still fill out their own tax returns take an average of 34 hours to do so. That is almost a week. That is a workweek almost for most people to comply or fill out the tax return--for those who still fill out their own tax returns. Bear in mind that a lot of Americans have gotten to the point where it is so complex, burdensome, and complicated they turn it over to a tax preparer. For those who still fill out their tax returns, 34 hours is the average they spend in complying with the Tax Code in this country. Ironically, the complexity and uncertainty of filing taxes is only amplified by congressional action. Since 1986, we have made--I say we, the Congress--have made 15,000 changes to our Tax Code, or approximately 2 every single day. Many of these changes focus on 1- or 2-year extensions of expiring provisions. For example, last year, Congress was unable to extend the alternative minimum tax until the IRS had published its 2007 tax return forms. Because of this delay, 13.5 million taxpayers had to wait until February 11 to file forms relative to the alternative minimum tax. Only Congress can create a complex tax provision, such as the alternative minimum tax, and actually make it more complicated by extending it after the IRS publication deadline. Unfortunately, the congressional leadership is simply either oblivious or unsympathetic to the tax burden on American families. Last month, the Senate Democrats called for the largest tax increase in American history. Under the Democratic budget, the reduced individual tax rates are set to expire in 20 months. As millions of Americans have now finished coping with this year's April 15 deadline, I think it is important to point out that this deadline is going to be even more painful under the Democratic budget that passed the Senate earlier this year. If the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts are not extended, on January 1, 2011, the 10-percent tax bracket will expire, the tax bracket that was put into effect that impacts low-income earners, lowers their tax liability and took literally millions of American taxpayers completely off the tax rolls. The 25-percent tax bracket that currently applies to earners in that tax rate bracket is going to go up to 28 percent. The 28- percent tax rate will increase to 31 percent. The 33-percent tax rate will increase to 36 percent. And the 35-percent tax rate will increase to 39.9 percent. On top of the increased tax rates that will happen on January 1, 2010, unless we take steps to extend and prevent those tax cuts from expiring, the increased child tax credit will expire as well. Families with children are going to see their tax burden increase substantially when the $1,000 tax credit is reduced to $500 after the year 2010. Additionally, the marriage penalty is reinstated. The 3l million filers who report dividend income and the 26 million filers who report capital gains income also will see their taxes on their investments go up. Finally, the death tax will be reinstated at pre-2001 levels of $1 million. In other words, you can exempt $1 million worth of your income, the wealth you acquired over the years, from the death tax liability. If we think about how that impacts small businesses, farmers, and ranchers--and I can share that as someone who lives in a rural State where we have a lot of farm and ranch families. We have a lot of people with lots of assets, lots of land, lots of equipment, but they are very cash poor. When you take $1 million anymore, with land values being what they are in a place such as even my State of South Dakota, you are going to have an awful lot of people who are going to be hit very hard by the death tax when it becomes reinstated at a $1 million-level exemption. Attach to that a maximum statutory rate of 55 percent--which, incidentally, is one of the highest death tax rates in the world. So literally you are going to have for people now who worked their whole lives--small businesses, farmers, ranchers--to accumulate some things to pass on to the next generation, all but $1 million of that would be taxed at a rate as high as 55 percent. Think about the impact that is going to have on family farm and ranch operations in this country and many of our small businesses, which is where most of the jobs in the country are generated. In total, the average family is going to see their taxes increase by roughly $2,300 per year. That is enough to buy several months of groceries or several months worth of health care. It does not have to be this difficult. Congress can work in a bipartisan manner to fix our broken Tax Code and to ease the tax burden for families and small businesses. Commissions have been convened, hearings have been held, studies have been published, and yet another tax day has passed without comprehensive tax reform. Streamlining our Tax Code will strengthen our economy, it will improve the competitiveness of our businesses, and it will greatly ease the tax burden for all American families. The problem is not that Washington taxes too little. The problem is that Washington spends too much. The American people, when they start spending virtually a third of their year to pay the tax burden that is imposed on them at the Federal level, the State level, and the local level, we are asking way too much and imposing way too much a burden on the working men and women in this country and those small businesses that are creating the jobs and those who are trying to pass on those operations to the next generation so we can keep family farms, ranches, and small businesses in the family, contributing, creating jobs, and paying taxes. With a confiscatory death tax, which will happen if we do not take steps to extend the tax cuts, we are going to see a lot of those farms, ranchers, and small businesses go by the wayside.

Skaggs: Mr. Speaker, this is bad budget policy. It is going to make it $30 billion-plus harder to balance the budget over the next 6 years. It is bad consumer policy, unlikely that our citizens are going to see very much of this reflected at the pump. It is lousy energy policy. We ought to be focused on conservation and efficiency. This goes in exactly the wrong direction. It is lousy national security policy because it aggravates our dependence on foreign imported oil and all that goes with that, and it is really lousy politics. It gives pandering a bad name. Does anyone here remember the budget deficit? Today, the House will vote on a bill to temporarily repeal the 4.3 cent gas tax increase that was a part of the landmark 1993 deficit reduction package. That deficit reduction bill was a big step toward getting the budget under control. Because of what we did in 1993, we've had 4 straight years of deficit reduction for the first time in decades. Since then, the deficit has been cut in half. So, why are we rushing to take up a bill to repeal the 4.3 cent gas tax that is dedicated to deficit reduction? The answer is that the Republican leadership thinks that there is election-year mileage to be had from pandering to what they think will be popular; and others among us are experiencing some panic about being caught on the wrong side of the issue. Pandering and panic--that's a potent election-year mix, but a toxic one in terms of good public policy. If anyone wonders whether the gas tax repeal is election year pandering, you only need to look at the effective dates in the bill-- the temporary gas tax cut would last from June until January, just long enough to take us through the election. Of course, that won't be the end of the story--we're told that the legislation implementing the budget resolution will include a permanent repeal. Permanent repeal of the part of the gas tax that goes to deficit reduction would add $33.9 billion to deficit by 2002. That would increase the deficit by several billion more than it was reduced by all the cuts in the appropriations bills for this year--cuts that the Republican leadership have called the ``down payment'' on a balanced budget. But that will come later. Today, we have the temporary repeal. The rationale for today's bill supposedly is the recent increase in prices at the gasoline pump. But will this bill reduce prices at the pump? Will it be passed on to the consumer? Not likely. The benefits of this bill will go directly to the oil refiners and there are many steps between the refiners and the pump. A reduction in gas taxes doesn't necessarily mean a reduction in gas prices. Energy expert Philip K. Verleger, Jr., an economist at Charles River Associates, has said, ``The Republican sponsored solution to the current fuels problem * * * is nothing more and nothing less than a refiners' benefit bill. It will transfer upward of $3 billion from the U.S. Treasury to the pockets of refiners and gasoline marketers.'' Even the conservative economist William Niskanen, president of the conservative Cato Institute, says, ``I don't think there is anything the Republicans can credibly do to guarantee that the tax reduction gets passed through to the consumer.'' A gas tax cut also won't do anything to address the serious economic, environmental and security issues that flow from our country's dependency on non-renewable sources of energy, especially imported oil. In poll after poll, when people are asked what the highest priority should be for energy policies, the majority support research and development for energy efficiency and renewable energy. So, what are the priorities of the new majority here in the House? Their budget resolution cuts funding for energy efficiency and renewable energy. As shown in this bill, political posturing about the price of gas. This bill is also bad policy because it sends exactly the wrong signal about conserving energy. We need to do more, not less, to encourage more efficient use of energy. Because gasoline has again become relatively cheap, and because national policy has stopped stressing the importance of fuel efficiency, we've been seeing the return of gas-guzzling cars, especially the increasingly popular sport utility vehicles. This bill would not do anything to counter this trend. We also need to continue development of technology for efficient, cost-effective use of solar and renewable energy sources. Petroleum is not a renewable resource, and passing this mistaken bill will only tend to discourage progress regarding better energy sources. Petroleum is also primarily an imported fuel. Efforts to encourage its use only add to our dependence on foreign sources, and complicate our national security interests and foreign policies. This bill should not be on our agenda. It won't help the consumer, but it will hurt the country. It's an oil bill all right--political snake oil. It's cheap politics, but with a high price of misplaced priorities and bad public policy. We should not be carried away by election-year panic. We should reject this bill.","word.count":856,"sep11":-5.44662921348315,"years":1996.41292134831,"days":503,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.00786365134239855,"Topic 2":0.5530321792458,"Topic 3":0.00854614940595654,"Topic 4":0.00844457292229634,"Topic 5":0.243248116121835,"Topic 6":0.00240895062524025,"Topic 7":0.00796190772520949,"Topic 8":0.0449139194812205,"Topic 9":0.00556436121218938,"Topic 10":0.118016191917854},{"id":"11020070005472","body":"Grace F. Napolitano: Mr. Speaker, I actually find very little in Mr. Dreier's comments I disagree with. I agree with almost everything he has said, and I commend him for that very thoughtful speech. Mr. Speaker, before I comment on the specifics, I'd also like to thank the members of the task force, especially Mr. Smith, who was the ranking member for Republicans. It was a great opportunity to become a friend of another Member. We did disagree in the end, but I found it to be a very thoughtful, fruitful, and enjoyable experience. I also want to thank other members of the committee: Mr. Price, Mr. Scott, Ms. McCollum, Mr. Meehan before he left, Mr. Hobson, Mr. Camp, and Mr. Tiahrt. I thought we had some great meetings, and it was a pleasure to me to engage in this endeavor. I also want to thank the Members of the freshman class of 2006. They're the ones who really kept the pressure on us to try to fix our ethics rules. They came here on the backs of public discontent with our actions, and they have kept our feet to the fire. I thank them for that. I also want to thank the many people that helped us walk through this. There are many people whom I will list in my extension of remarks at a later time because there are too many of them. I do want to point out one staff member, in particular my own, Christina Tsafoulias, who worked countless hours trying to get through this. I want to thank her publicly for that. On the specifics, again I think I agree with most everything Mr. Dreier said. This is really all about public trust, but the point that seems to be missed is the public does not trust us on ethics issues at this point. Maybe that's fair. Maybe that's unfair. Maybe it's based on reality. Maybe it's based on perception. But it is a fact. They do not trust us. They don't trust us for many different reasons. As I see it, I can point to two different issues in particular: the perception of the good-ol'-boy network. Now, maybe that's not fair, but it's certainly what our constituents think. They think we are all here protecting each other. They think that we operate beyond closed doors and smoke-filled rooms to make sure that no bad things get said about our colleagues. I don't think that is true, but that's certainly the perception. When people don't have trust in the system, they don't have trust in us, and I think that's an important thing to address. The other part of it, as was already pointed out, is transparency, or the lack thereof. That encourages people to think that the good-ol'-boy network is all that we rely on. As far as partisanship, I totally agree. Any system that results in partisanship on ethics matters is unsuccessful. But partisanship has two points: yes, there is partisanship to initiate witch hunts, and that is a concern, I believe, this proposal addresses that by requiring joint appointments and by requiring one Democratic appointment and one Republican appointment to initiate a review. It totally undermines any legitimate concerns about partisanship witch hunts. But the other side of the coin that nobody here wants to talk about is the potential for partisan stonewalling, which we have suffered in this House in the past where one party simply says, You cannot look at our Member. Period. End of discussion. And if you do, we will remove Members from the Ethics Committee who look at that Member, which has happened in this House, and everybody knows it. And to think that partisanship is only a one-sided witch hunt is a mistake. Partisanship is also stonewalling. It's also protecting our fellow colleagues who may or may not have done something wrong simply because they come from the same party as we do. That's just as wrong as partisan witch hunts, and I believe this proposal addresses that as well. I also want to comment on the two proposals that were dropped on us lately. One of them had been in one form or another for a while; but both of them, in their final form, were dropped on us lately. I will simply tell you that, yes, we did look at them; and I have an opinion here which I will submit to the Record from the Congressional Research Service and one from the House counsel that states by bringing non- Members into a Member-oriented item to have official votes on matters in this House is likely to be unconstitutional. Now, I know that some people don't want to hear it, and certainly it won't be definitive until the Supreme Court were ever to act on it, but there is all of these constitutional questions on everything we do. I, for one, am a lawyer. I try to figure out how unconstitutional an issue might be; and if the answer is it's more likely to be unconstitutional than not, I won't do it. If the answer is I think it's constitutional, you try it. If it gets knocked down in court later on, so be it. So these two proposals, according to two independent agencies we could get direct answers on quickly, believe that it's unconstitutional. As far as the rule goes, I have had a year's worth of debate, and I would have welcomed anybody to come to any of our meetings and participated at any time they wanted to have the hours-on-hours of discussion. At the same time, this is a pretty simple proposal. I know some people don't like the concept of an independent entity having something to do with our ethics process. I respect that opinion. I disagree with it, but I respect it. It is a fair concern. At the same time, that's what this is. An up-or-down vote on that, I think, is a fair thing for the American people to let them know how we feel about this concept. The material I referred to previously I will insert into the Record at this point.","word.count":115,"sep11":5.54494382022472,"years":2007.40449438202,"days":4416,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.244723419099916,"Topic 2":0.17657624056145,"Topic 3":0.0315863257286384,"Topic 4":0.197733570848863,"Topic 5":0.0402954648934624,"Topic 6":0.014099877040381,"Topic 7":0.0469757031438565,"Topic 8":0.201416579469588,"Topic 9":0.0112841844958128,"Topic 10":0.0353086347180318},{"id":"11020070079875","body":"Larry E.

But the man or woman of the American economy today who is at the gas pump and filling his or her car or truck wants to know about tomorrow and next week and next year. Are gas prices going to continue to go up? What is the problem here? Why isn't this great Nation more self-sufficient? And for those who study energy a good deal and see a 60-percent reliance on foreign production, shouldn't we be worried about national security? Shouldn't we be worried about the emergence of petronationalism, about a little dictator down in Venezuela jerking the tail of a great country because he supplies 17 percent of our total foreign imports? Yes, we ought to be concerned about that. We ought to be angry about it. The reason we grew complacent, the light switch would always produce a light or the gas pump would always produce inexpensive fuel, is because it has always been there. What a large part of Americans didn't know is that politically and in a public policy way we began to set in place a series of things over the last 20 years that flattened production, made it less profitable, created self-reliance, and didn't compete and keep up with the amount of consumed energy we were requiring of a growth economy. As a result, we hit the wall. The wall is $3-plus gas. All power bills are going up. Energy is a part of America's disposable income and is becoming an increasingly bigger part. Americans are sitting now scratching their heads and saying: Are we going to have to change our lifestyles because energy is going to cost a lot more? My wife and I and a group of Senators, the week before last, traveled in Europe. As we landed at Andrews Air Force Base, got in our cars and headed home, I turned to my wife and said: I see we are back in the land of the big cars. That is part of our addiction. We love our big cars. We had been traveling in Luxembourg, France, and Italy, and by definition, it is the land of the little car. Why? Because gas over there from a gallonage point of view is about $7.50 a gallon. It is at least double plus a little more of what we are currently paying today. As a result, Europeans significantly over the last 20 years have changed their lifestyles because they couldn't afford the energy. I am not going to apologize because America consumes a lot of energy. We are nearly 26 percent of the world economy. We consume 26 percent of the energy base. Why? Because we are 26 percent of the world economy. It takes energy to produce jobs, to produce products, to create an economy. We are driven by energy. It is going to cost more to stay at 26 percent if we don't develop good public policy that gets us through tomorrow and takes us into the future in a way that the consumer can understand and appreciate. Consumers are angry today, and they have a right to be. They look at very large profits on the part of the oil companies and say: Look, it is their fault. Those profits are driven by demand and the ability to supply. There are no gas lines today because there is energy at the pump, but we are paying more for it. The Senator from North Dakota is right, the politics of this issue would change again if there were long gas lines at the pump and they were paying $3-plus a gallon. So the supply is there in the current form, but 60 percent of it comes from a foreign nation somewhere in the world. Most of those supplies and those foreign nations are in very precarious political situations. It is a very unstable world out there from whence these supplies come. As a result, the futures market anticipates that and builds a margin in to offset the risk to deal with the demand. What am I saying here? I am saying to the Senate today that S. 1419 is a piece of the total, but it isn't where we ought to be tomorrow. Tomorrow ought to be about energy security and energy production. You don't talk green, although you have to talk green and should talk green. You don't talk cellulosic ethanol being in production in 10 years at a rate of 15 billion gallons a year because it won't be, because the technology isn't there, although we are driving there. Energy efficiency, a CAFE standard, is a place we ought to go. I for the first time join with the Senator from North Dakota in a 4-percent mandatory efficiency. That takes us down the road. But that is out in the future. What about tomorrow? What about knowing where our current oil reserves are, the 15 or 20 billion barrels or more of oil that is in the Outer Continental Shelf that may be very accessible in a clean and environmentally sound way? What about expanding our refinery capacity? Because in this transitional period of the next two-and-a- half to three decades, where more cars will be electric, more cars will be hybrid, we will be producing 20 percent of our liquid transportation fuels from corn-based ethanol, cellulosic-based ethanol, to get to the 30 to 32 billion gallons a year. What about all of that? That is our future. My consumers in Idaho want to know about tomorrow. The Reid-Bingaman bill has nothing to do with tomorrow. We simply cannot ignore the next 10 or 15 years and jump into the future. We have to continue to produce and we need to produce. We have to continue to refine the hydrocarbons to supply the gas, and we need to expand that capability. It better be on shore. It better not be in Venezuela or in Kuwait or Saudi Arabia or someplace else that is at this moment, at best, politically unstable, let alone Iran and Iraq. That is where our dependence lies today. To fail to address that in the Senate is to fail to address the No. 1 question of a great nation: How do we stay great? How do we stay at 26 percent of the world GDP? How do we stay generous to the rest of the world? We produce and push a lot of new technology, and that is in part what the Reid bill is about. That is all going to be transparent and giveable to the rest of the world. When we lead on energy in all aspects, the rest of the world benefits because we share it. Therefore, as this bill comes to the floor, there is a great deal that has to be done. We need a new RPS, renewable portfolio standard, wind, solar--a great idea, an old concept. Today's energy world is about cleanliness. Why not a new standard? Why not a clean portfolio standard instead of a renewable portfolio standard? Include wind, include solar, include sequestration of carbon, include efficiencies, include nuclear, include hydro. Let's get on with the business of being clean. If Senator Reid wants to come to the floor and talk about climate change, then he ought to be talking about all of those other things that drive the economy toward a cleaner energy future, not command and control but incentives, creativity, bringing off the laboratory shelf and into production the kind of things we know are already out there. Coal to liquids, what is wrong with that? Some environmental groups are wringing their hands and saying: There might be a problem there. We know it will burn 90 percent cleaner. That is not a problem. It is only in the mind of some idealist that it isn't perfect. How do you get to perfection? You start by adjusting and changing and improving. Today we are tremendously proud of our ethanol production in corn. But it has been 20 years in refinement and development to the distillery that is set up tomorrow somewhere in the Midwest. It is going to be so much better than the distillery that went into production a decade and a half ago. That is what this bill ought to be about, and it isn't there today. What about the tax incentives, and what is the Finance Committee going to do? None of that is there. This chart illustrates the problem. Here is the line for demand; here is supply. This is the hydrocarbons. That is pretty simple. Where does this margin come from? Offshore, foreign countries. High risk, less national security. Why do a lot of military leaders and those who look in broader terms support what Byron Dorgan and Larry Craig did today in the SAFE bill and those three factors about production, efficiency, and biofuels? They support it because of national security, taking this out of the equation, getting us back into production. You have heard me talk a lot over the past about the Outer Continental Shelf and the billions and billions of gallons of oil that is out there. We have allowed States to say no even though it is a national, Federal resource. Last year we picked up a little bit right here in lease sale 181, but here in the eastern gulf are phenomenal resources, billions and billions of barrels of oil that are very accessible, achievable in a sound environmental way, and we are still saying no. We are still saying, let a tinhorn dictator in Venezuela jerk us around. Here is another problem.

On Monday, Lehman Brothers filed for the largest bankruptcy in American history. This collapse will hurt hardworking Americans' ability to access credit and could deteriorate their pension plans. For example, the city of Detroit's general retirement system that had invested in the bank could lose up to $25 million. Can you imagine what would have happened if Social Security had been privatized? This failure occurs as Bank of America announced that it was buying Merrill Lynch and the Federal Reserve announced it was taking over the world's largest insurer, AIG, for the staggering cost of $85 billion. Washington Mutual is still struggling to survive their investments tied to the mortgage market. As a result of these events, the Dow Jones dropped more than 500 points on Monday--the biggest drop since September 11, and Wednesday it dropped almost 450 points. These announcements come as middle-class families face the highest unemployment rate in 5 years, record home foreclosures, and skyrocketing gas and grocery prices. Despite these conditions, our colleague, Senator McCain responded that ``the fundamentals of our economy are strong.'' I would like him to tell that to the 84,000 Americans who lost their jobs, or the 91,000 families who lost their homes last month, or the 605,000 Americans who have lost their job since January. And now, Senator McCain's solution is to create a commission to study the problem. Middle-class families don't need a study to tell them that we're in an economic crisis. They see it every day when they try to fill up their gas tanks or put food on the table. They have known it for the past 8 years, as they have watched jobs sent overseas and their pensions disappear. Unlike Senator McCain's economic adviser, Phil Gramm, middle-class families don't need a study to tell them that this isn't a ``mental recession.'' What they need are real economic solutions and not 4 more years of the same failed economic policies. So one of the question I know Michigan families have is, how did we get here? Unfortunately, these failed policies go back for some time. One example can be seen under the Republican Congress, when McCain's former economic adviser Senator Phil Gramm slipped a provision known as the ``Enron loophole'' into the 11,000-page appropriations bill on a Friday night before recess. This provision allowed financial institutions to trade an unlimited amount of energy commodities on dark, over-the-counter markets that are beyond the jurisdiction of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission. Only now, with Democrats in the majority, are we seeing any accountability as we closed the Enron loophole. However, trading on the bilateral swaps markets and the electronic trading facilities are still conducted on these dark markets with no transparency or regulation. The Commodities Futures Trading Commission only has the power to get information on these markets on an ad hoc basis so speculative investors continue to pour money into the markets without any oversight. Yet Republicans continue to oppose providing more authority and resources to the CFTC. Authority that would allow necessary regulation of our commodities markets and protection against manipulative behavior that could influence the price of food and gas for every American. This just reiterates the failed philosophy of President Bush, John McCain and Republican economics that believe in less oversight, less accountability--more greed--at the expense of American families. Nowhere is this seen clearer than what is happening in the housing market-- the root of our current crisis. The lack of regulation and oversight by the Bush administration allowed for predatory lending to flourish. In 1994, Congress gave the Federal Reserve the authority to prohibit these unfair and deceptive lending practices. The Fed waited 14 years before implementing regulations. Senators Schumer, Sarbanes, and Dodd introduced legislation to protect homeowners from predatory lending. No Republicans cosponsored these bills. Then in 2004, despite warnings, the Fed actually promoted nontraditional mortgages over fixed-rate mortgages, resulting in the skyrocketing use of ARM and subprime mortgages. In 2006, regulators finally finalized rules over nontraditional mortgage products, but it did not apply to subprime mortgages. The Democratic-led Congress held oversight hearings, spoke out time and time again, and yet the administration still sat back and did nothing. In 2007, the Treasury was still downplaying the subprime crisis by explaining that it was ``largely contained'' and admitting they ``could have done more sooner.'' The Republican philosophy of no public accountability and unlimited greed created markets where these risky mortgages, that they promoted, were packaged and sold as complex debt securities without any oversight. Then, without any regulation, credit rating agencies were allowed to inflate the value of these complex securities and assign triple-A ratings despite their inherent risks. Greed continued to fuel the vicious cycle until our financial industry was completely entangled in these risky securities. When homeowners defaulted on their loans, it sent ripple effects throughout the entire economy, bringing down the large banks that had invested in the mortgage market, such as Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. Time and time again, Democrats have tried to enact changes, but every attempt has been blocked by Republicans. In 2005, the House of Representatives passed a bill that would have created a new regulator to oversee government sponsored enterprises-- providing the authority to set capital requirements and limit portfolio size. When I was on the Banking Committee, we worked to enact this legislation, but we were blocked by the Bush administration. This session Democrats introduced legislation to strengthen regulation over government sponsored enterprises, to keep families in their homes and help communities struggling with foreclosures. Republicans opposed this legislation and, while more families lost their homes to foreclosures, they continued to block the bill for months. Only after Fannie and Freddie reached the point of crisis did the administration finally lift their opposition, further highlighting the inherent problems with the Bush/McCain economic philosophy--it is always too little too late. Now while Republicans have let the markets ``work it out,'' small businesses and families are faced with tightening credit markets, job losses, increased foreclosures and a loss of confidence in our economy. Each of these examples shows the fundamental failures of the Bush/ McCain economic policies. Policies that are based on greed as a national virtue and high profits at any cost. Policies that send American jobs overseas while increasing tax breaks for big oil. Our economy cannot take another 4 years of this failed policy; American families cannot take another 4 years. Out country can do better. It is time for a change. We are in a very important discussion right now, not only about what we need to do together to move our country forward, but it is important to talk about how we got here, because how we got here matters. Critiquing the philosophy that got us here matters, if we are not going to repeat it in the future. When we sum it up, when I look at what I call ``Republican economics 101,'' it is more deregulation. We heard it again today. I heard it from one of my colleagues today, the problem with all of this is that we need more deregulation, more deregulation. Lack of accountability, I call it, lack of transparency. More home foreclosures have come from Republican economics 101, more jobs lost, more tax breaks for the wealthy. That seems to be the answer to everything: Lose your job, let's have another tax cut for the wealthy. Lose your house, let's have another tax cut for the wealthy. Can't pay for gas at the pump? How about another tax cut for the wealthy. Financial markets exploding? Let's have another tax cut for the wealthy. That seems to be the mantra of the Republican economics 101 theme. More excessive profits for oil companies which have translated into $5 at the pump. The bottom line is, we don't want more of the same. That is why it does matter how we got here. We do not want more of the same. The American people cannot take more of the same. Enough is enough. That is certainly what the people in Michigan are saying. Let me specifically speak to what has occurred this week. On Monday, Lehman Brothers filed for the largest bankruptcy in American history. This collapse will hurt the people of Michigan, hard-working Americans' ability to access credit, and could very well deteriorate pension plans. For example, we heard yesterday the city of Detroit's general retirement system that has invested in the bank could lose as much as $25 million. I am sure that is only one example. Imagine what would have happened if President Bush had succeeded, with John McCain's support, in privatizing Social Security. I will never forget what happened after Enron, when I had former employees come in to me who had lost everything, trusted the company, invested in the company, lost everything. They said: Thank God for Social Security. It is the only thing I have left. Imagine if the Republican philosophy of privatizing had happened. One of the things I am most proud about in working with our Democratic leadership and our majority is we were totally together in blocking the President from proceeding. It was one of the most important achievements as a Democratic majority, stopping the President, John McCain, and others who wanted to privatize Social Security. We now know that the failure of Lehman Brothers occurred as Bank of America announced it was buying Merrill Lynch and the Federal Reserve announced it was ","word.count":2612,"sep11":7.20224719101124,"years":2009.06179775281,"days":5006,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.437895357328303,"Topic 2":0.204778997310792,"Topic 3":0.0051590657359981,"Topic 4":0.246078078713421,"Topic 5":0.00456300279985955,"Topic 6":0.00340641849728837,"Topic 7":0.0747314781421161,"Topic 8":0.00572149989702973,"Topic 9":0.0130925463656184,"Topic 10":0.00457355520957385},{"id":"10419960075534","body":"Bennett Johnston: Mr. President, in the original form of our bill, we provided for 100 millirem radioactivity limit from the repository. However, because our friends from Nevada stated the EPA should have a role here, we amended that. The present bill now on third reading provides, if EPA finds that the 100 millirem would not be consistent with health or safety, they may set it at another level and, indeed, whatever they would set under the Administrative Procedure Act would be final unless that level is arbitrary and capricious. Madam President, we have provided here for the role of EPA to make the health and safety determination. Why did we set it at 100 millirems to begin with? Because that is the level set by the International Commission on Radiological Protection, the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and indeed the EPA in its radiation protection guidance for exposure of the general public, 1994, as well as the International Atomic Agency. Beyond that, the 100 millirems is a commonsense level because there is more than 100 millirems difference in the natural exposure of someone in Washington, DC, which is about 345 millirems, and Montana, Wyoming, or Colorado, where the average exposure exceeds 450 millirems, so that if you live in an average place in the United States or if you live in Washington, DC, you would get a higher exposure by flying to Denver, CO, or Butte, MT, Cody, WY, or you name it, and living there than living here. I remind my colleagues, Madam President, there has never been the slightest warning of EPA or of any nuclear radiation body to say it is dangerous to live in one of those mountain States where the millirem activity per year exceeds what we provide in this bill. If EPA should so decide, they may set the standard elsewhere. Madam President, Nevada is the right choice. Nevada is one of the most remote places on Earth, Yucca Mountain. It is one of the driest places on Earth, and, Madam President, that area has been polluted by over 500 nuclear tests which have been not sealed off from the environment. Those nuclear tests have provided all of the radiation byproducts that are contained in nuclear waste, including cesium 137, iodine 131, strontium 90, americium 243, technicium 99, plutonium 241. You name it, if it is in nuclear waste, it is contained already in the Nevada test site. Need I remind my colleagues that our two colleagues from Nevada have been steadfast in wanting not less tests but more tests at the Nevada test site. Those tests have not been sealed off from the environment. Indeed, some of those tests have been right in the water table. What is the defense of my colleague from Nevada when we say, how could you on the one hand want nuclear bomb tests and on the other hand not want these rods which are in canisters, and those canisters are nonleak canisters that I believe would be valid and provide protection for 10,000 years? The answer is, well, they are only 1 ton. I guess that is somewhere between 2,000 and, if you use a long ton, 2,200 pounds of nuclear material. Now, Madam President, a ton of radioactive material not sealed off from the environment is many thousands of times what you would expect in any leakage which might occur thousands of years from now from one of these containers. The containers designed to hold these nuclear waste rods are designed to last hundreds and thousands of years. We would imagine they would last, frankly, 10,000 years. That has not been proved. I do not state that as a fact. That is what we speculate. But, certainly, hundreds of years without any leakage whatever. Yet the Nevada test site now already has 1 ton of all these radioactive products which are not sealed off from the water supply, not sealed off from the ground around it, but where unprotected blasts took place in the ground. Madam President, if there is ever a place in the country to store the nuclear waste, it is adjacent to that Nevada test site. That is why, Madam President, the Congress chose in 1987 Yucca Mountain. That is why it is the right place to store this waste today.","word.count":723,"sep11":-5.24719101123596,"years":1996.61235955056,"days":574,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0604854067304831,"Topic 2":0.230374496694403,"Topic 3":0.0597808357293081,"Topic 4":0.0247009777218122,"Topic 5":0.112549040198049,"Topic 6":0.0261026449807684,"Topic 7":0.00876950512298729,"Topic 8":0.445946544269604,"Topic 9":0.0106822491279865,"Topic 10":0.0206082994245986},{"id":"10920050029974","body":"NA","word.count":791,"sep11":4.15449438202247,"years":2006.01404494382,"days":3921,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.134020664265136,"Topic 2":0.133958334925035,"Topic 3":0.120730076899856,"Topic 4":0.0986023080119058,"Topic 5":0.187306342839211,"Topic 6":0.0154938953690876,"Topic 7":0.00424025505272675,"Topic 8":0.286193153422916,"Topic 9":0.0117768083356497,"Topic 10":0.00767816087847523},{"id":"10620000017837","body":"Ike Skelton: Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume I rise in strong support of H.J. Res. 101, a resolution commemorating the 225th anniversary of our United States Army. The principal land force of our country, the United States Army traces its origins to the Continental Army of the Revolutionary War. That Army, raised by the Continental Congress, had the mission of engaging British and Hessian regulars and won our country's independence. That Army was composed largely of long serving volunteers. Now some 225 years and numerous major wars and minor conflicts later, our U.S. Army is again composed of volunteers. We have come full circle. What is important and why we recognize the anniversary of the Army today is that the U.S. Army has defended our Nation and fought with distinction on countless occasions. We in Congress and the American people owe a debt of gratitude to all those who have served in our Army. While the Army dates from 1775, the U.S. Army as a permanent institution really began in June of 1784 when the Confederation Congress approved a resolution to establish a regiment of 700 officers and men to assert Federal authority in the Ohio River Valley. Congress adopted this tiny force after the reorganization of the government under the Constitution of 1789. Since then, the Army has served our great Nation with distinction in many, many memorable conflicts. From its humble beginnings, the Army has been the key force in achieving military success in the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Mexican War, the War Between the States, the Spanish-American War, the First World War, the Second World War, the Korean War, and, of course, the war in Vietnam and, more recently, the Persian Gulf War. Hundreds of memorable battles in these many conflicts highlight a truly illustrious history of dedicated service and selfless sacrifice by literally millions of Americans. Beyond the Army's participation in these major wars, the Army has also been a successful instrument in implementing our Nation's foreign policy objectives and helping to restore democratic institutions of government in a myriad of smaller, short-of-war conflicts and interventions, particularly within the last 50 years. Places like Panama, Grenada, Haiti, Somalia, Bosnia and Kosovo come to mind. As we think today about the great service of our Army and what it has performed over the years, it is important to bear in mind two key considerations: First, the U.S. Army is really a microcosm of American society. Dating back to the days of the original militia in the Revolutionary War, our Army has succeeded in large measure because of the participation of citizen-soldiers. I believe our Army and our military will continue to be as successful as they have been only as long as the people who comprise our forces reflect the makeup of our country and only as long as they have the support of the American people. We need to continue to recruit and retain high quality personnel so that the total Army will continue to be the formidable force that it is today. The second characteristic of the Army that has made it such a success is that it has adapted to changes in warfare, tactics, and techniques as well as technology. It has stayed ahead of our adversaries in efforts to reform, modernize and win wars. From the change from conscription to the all volunteer force; from the use of flintlock muskets to the use of stealth technology of today, the U.S. Army has evolved to become the premier ground force in the world. The effort under way now, to transform the Army into a lighter, more mobile and more lethal force, shows that our Army continues to adapt to the rigors of the modern battlefield and will continue to be successful in the years ahead. As much as we may be inclined to remember the major wars and battles that ultimately brought us victory over the years, it is really the men and women who serve so bravely and so well to whom we should pay tribute to today. Without their selfless dedication, their valor, their perseverance, America would likely not be the free and prosperous society it is as we enjoy it today. H.J. Res. 101 recognizes their service, expresses the gratitude of the Congress and the American people, and calls upon the President to issue an appropriate proclamation, something that he unquestionably should do. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.","word.count":758,"sep11":-1.27808988764045,"years":2000.58146067416,"days":1987,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.109718475053916,"Topic 2":0.317153942563122,"Topic 3":0.0782604275351876,"Topic 4":0.0143668744563451,"Topic 5":0.0866001837463477,"Topic 6":0.00795283760812273,"Topic 7":0.346358444111189,"Topic 8":0.0146916347832451,"Topic 9":0.0197329986632541,"Topic 10":0.00516418147927108},{"id":"10820030003505","body":"Michael Oxley: Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of legislation to end misguided obesity-related lawsuits. The Personal Responsibility in Food Consumption Act, H.R. 339, would take a strong step forward in accomplishing this goal. I strongly support this common sense legislation and believe it is time to end frivolous lawsuits against our nation's 878,000 restaurants and their 12 million employees. In recent years, our nation's vast restaurant industry has come under attack from absurd obesity lawsuits. This litigation has bogged down the judicial process and threatens small business owners. A recent poll shows that 89 percent of Americans believe that restaurants should not be held liable for an individual's obesity or weight gain. The National Restaurant Association believes lawsuits attacking food is not the answer to our nation's obesity problem. Emphasis must be placed on education, personal responsibility, moderation, and healthier lifestyles.

I too have introduced legislation to require electronic filing of Federal Election Commission reports, and I would hope that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle who have complained about the lack of opportunities to support real campaign finance reform will join us in supporting this important measure, because who could possibly be opposed to this common sense reform? It ensures accountability and provides access to essential information regarding our political system. Right now when we file a campaign finance report with the FEC, we have to file it by the deadline imposed by the FEC. But that filing simply means putting it in the mail, the U.S. Postal Service, and sometimes it can take a week to get that report to the FEC. They then might take another several days or more to get it up and available to the public, so the news media, campaigns, the general public have a delay of sometimes 10 days or even 2 weeks between when a contribution is made and when they can learn about who contributed to whom in this situation. I think it is critically important that we adopt this legislation with electronic filing. We can still file on the deadline, but they will receive it on the deadline as well. And if we require them to immediately put it up on the Internet, everyone in the country with access to a computer in their home and libraries and schools can have access to this information instantaneously, and that is a critical reform, letting people decide for themselves what the purpose of campaign contributions are, who is receiving what for what purpose. The best way to deal with campaign finance is to lay it out on the table and let the public know exactly who has received what. Who could possibly oppose requiring campaign committees that raise or spend more than $50,000 to file their reports electronically with the FEC? Who could possibly oppose a requirement that Federal committees immediately report contributions and expenditures made within 90 days of an election? I urge adoption of this legislation.","word.count":233,"sep11":-4.48314606741573,"years":1997.37640449438,"days":846,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.106686659289714,"Topic 2":0.0755366769288105,"Topic 3":0.0124157809243589,"Topic 4":0.0122627187120331,"Topic 5":0.275785354622283,"Topic 6":0.00872207673605656,"Topic 7":0.0235686223928361,"Topic 8":0.310755933214197,"Topic 9":0.162506694303605,"Topic 10":0.0117594828761051},{"id":"10820040013981","body":"Tom Cole: Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr. Speaker, it is a great honor for me to request consideration of H. Con. Res. 417 because this resolution honors a remarkable group of African Americans who played a pivotal role in the military history of our country. They are not the only segregated unit to do so, of course. The 54th Massachusetts during the Civil War, the 9th and 10th Buffalo Calvary, which were honored with the name Buffalo Soldiers by their native American adversaries in the latter part of the 19th century, a group which constructed Fort Sill in my own district and won lasting fame there. And of course more recently, the 761st Tank Battalion whose exploits have been chronicled in a fine volume by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. But today, we are here to honor the Tuskegee Airmen who with their professionalism, their skill, and courage not only made an important contribution to fighting tyranny during the Second World War but also helped to forge the United States Air Force into the world's dominant air and space team. On July 19, 1941, the Army Air Force began a program in Alabama at the Tuskegee Institute to train African Americans as military pilots. The primary flight training was conducted by the Division of Aeronautics at the institute founded by Booker T. Washington, and the transition to combat aircraft was conducted at nearby Tuskegee Army Airfield. The first group of pilots completed training 9 months later in March 1942. Among that vanguard group was then-Captain Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., a future living legend in the Air Force who went on to become one of its greatest leaders. In the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1999, the Congress authorized the President to advance Lieutenant General Davis to the grade of General on the retired list of the United States Air Force. That initial group of Tuskegee pilots was assigned to the famous 99th Fighter Squadron, which was eventually deployed on May 31, 1943, to fly P-40 Warhawks in combat missions in North Africa, Sicily, and throughout Italy. Later Tuskegee graduates were assigned to the 332nd Fighter Group and began overseas combat operations in Italy flying the P-40 and P-39 Airacobra. Before the war ended, the Tuskegee program had graduated 992 pilots and 450 Tuskegee Airmen had flown over 15,000 combat sorties overseas. Approximately 150 men had been killed over the course of the program, with 66 killed in action. The combat record of these segregated units was superb. They destroyed or damaged 136 enemy aircraft in air-to-air combat and another 273 on the ground. They were highly decorated with over 150 Distinguished Flying Crosses being awarded to African American pilots. The most impressive achievement of the 332nd Fighter Group was flying over 200 bomber escort missions over Central and Southern Europe without losing a single bomber to enemy aircraft. This unprecedented record was not lost on enemy fighter pilots who often elected to avoid attacking bomber formations when they realized that the fighter escort was the Red Tail fighters of the 332nd. The challenges confronted by the Tuskegee Airmen were not limited to the wartime skies over Europe. Each of these men proudly met all challenges with skill and determination when racism and bigotry had caused lesser men to harass them and to seek their failure. There are a number of ways for men to display courage in their lives, but seldom are men confronted with as many tests of courage as were the Tuskegee Airmen; and very few men can claim as successful and enduring a legacy as they. These combat pioneers distinguished themselves throughout their service in war and peace and over time redefined America's understanding of African Americans as warriors and leaders and set the stage for the racially integrated Air Force that achieved so much in the years to follow. Mr. Speaker, I commend the gentleman from Nevada for introducing this resolution. I feel very fortunate to have had the opportunity to address the House on this issue and recognize the contributions of Tuskegee Airmen to America. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.","word.count":693,"sep11":2.79213483146067,"years":2004.65168539326,"days":3436,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0222137798420582,"Topic 2":0.157534778681903,"Topic 3":0.0460488206754617,"Topic 4":0.251627940289402,"Topic 5":0.0102540731281876,"Topic 6":0.27416380678174,"Topic 7":0.153649831501749,"Topic 8":0.0181044646660014,"Topic 9":0.0125730930223001,"Topic 10":0.0538294114111971},{"id":"10820040037602","body":"Judd Gregg: Mr. President, I rise in support of this piece of legislation. I join the Senator from Iowa, the chairman of the Finance Committee, along with the senior Senator from the Democratic party on my committee, Mr. Kennedy, and I believe Senator Baucus. We worked long and hard to address this issue--and it is a critical issue--of how we make sure the pension system in this country, or especially relating to defined benefit pensions, is maintained in a viable and strong way. The pension system in this country is, regrettably, in trouble. But the amendment being offered today is designed to restore stability to the pension system and give us the time to solve the broad, difficult problems facing the pension system. Last week, when the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation released its annual report outlining record losses, Labor Secretary Chao put the issue in proper perspective when she said: Time is the key thing here. That is why we need to legislate today. The amendment gives critical players the time they need in the area of reform to accomplish the changes necessary to get through this period in front of us. There is in this bill a temporary interest rate fix which gives Congress time to review all of the options and make the right decisions on funding, reporting, and many other issues facing the troubled pension system. There is also in this bill something called the deficit reduction contribution relief area which gives airlines and steel companies the time they need to get their affairs in order after a unique and unusual period of pressure. Further, there is reform in the area of the multiemployer pension system which will give relief to management and labor to get their agreements in order relative to collective bargaining in order to make sure those funds are solvent. No one--Congress, employers, nor unions--is absolved of responsibility under this amendment. By granting time, we do not reduce--that should be stressed--anyone's debts nor allow anyone to avoid liability for debts they have voluntarily accepted. What we do is provide the necessary breathing room so reforms and repayments are made in a responsible and manageable fashion and not under the threat of ``the sky is falling'' situations we confront today. The amendment has essentially four elements, as I have outlined. First is reform of the 30-year Treasury note as being the vehicle by which we assess pension funding. Second is temporary relief for specific single-employer pension plans from deficit reduction contributions, such as airlines and steel. Third is a 2-year delay in the amortization of recent investment losses experienced by multiemployer pension plans and the imposition of significant improvements in the disclosure of information requirements of those plans to their participants, which is critical. Turning to the interest rate fix issue, this is the key issue for me. I have spoken about this a number of times on this floor. In fact, back in May I said: Now is the time to address this. I guess ``now'' has become now. But the fact is, we have today a system where 30-year Treasury bond rates are required in the current pension law for funding purposes. We will replace that with a conservative rate pegged to the high- quality bond corporate basket. The reason for this is that 30-year bonds essentially do not exist anymore so we have an artificial rate under which we were requiring companies and pension funds to be funded. The practical effect of that was that the bond rate was artificially low, which meant the return on these funds was artificially low and the funding requirements became, unfortunately, in real terms, extraordinarily high and inconsistent with what a realistic rate would be. By shifting to a corporate basket of high yield corporate bonds, we will correct this problem, significantly improve the viability of the pension system, and allow the corporations, for a period of 2 years, to use this temporary fix. It is a temporary fix. Two years is a risk, I admit. Whether or not we can put in place the necessary law changes and reach agreement between the various players that are involved at the table, including the unions, corporations, and the guaranteed fund is a question. It is a short timeframe to resolve this issue. I would have preferred more time so we could be sure we would reach an accommodation and a timeframe that were realistic, but that is not what others wanted. It was not what we were able to accomplish. As we all know, legislating is sometimes the art of compromise, and in this instance that was the case. So we have a 2-year hiatus using a basket of high yield corporate bonds as the new benchmark for funding. That will be positive relief, and it will mean, in practical terms, that funds which would have been artificially flowing into funding pension funds--and unnecessarily flowing into those funds as a result of having to use the low Treasury rate--will now be flowing into capital investment which translates directly into jobs. That is what this is about, protecting jobs and protecting pensions. The second area is the deficit reduction contribution relief function. The amendment grants 2 years of relief to the airline and steel industries from mandatory deficit reduction contributions. Other companies may also apply to the Treasury Department for similar relief. Companies getting relief must remain current on their pension obligations and cannot increase the benefits that they create under their pension funds during this period. Airlines are the main focus of the deficit reduction contribution relief. Airlines are the main focus because of the unique stress these companies have suffered. In recent years, profit pressures within the U.S. airline industry have been amplified by severe pricing competition, the recession, and, most importantly, by the effects of terrorism and the war in Iraq. Severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS, also created pressure on the entire industry, especially those flying overseas. The industry is in transition. The public has been reluctant to return since September 11 to the level of travel we had before September 11. Two airlines have already filed for bankruptcy protection. Others may follow suit. It is our intention with this amendment to ensure that pension rules are not the determining factor in selecting which airlines survive and which fail. We should not be kicking airlines over into bankruptcy on the issue of pensions. If that happens, it should be a function of their operating activity in the area of competing for passengers. The PBGC is also concerned about the steel industry, especially two specific companies which have filed bankruptcy. Last year the agency absorbed the largest pension plan in its history when it trusteed the Bethlehem Steel plan. Only a few steel company pension plans still exist. The DRC portion of the amendment gives these plans in this troubled industry a chance to get their finances in order without the imminent threat of a takeover by the PBGC. The DRC provisions are important safeguards to the system and especially to the PBGC. Plans taking the relief must pay 20 percent of their obligation in the first year and 40 percent of their obligation the second year or the plan's expected current liability for the year, whichever is greater. This ensures that no plan will lose ground and become worse off than it was when we started this process. Plans that are funded at only 75 percent or less are also prohibited from increasing benefits during this 2-year moratorium. There is strict accountability. Furthermore, there has been talk of freezing the PBGC guarantee for these plans. The multiple employer benefit plan relief is another area that this bill addresses. What the amendment does is allow plans to suspend amortizing their experience losses for 2 years. Multis may amortize experience losses over 15 years under current law. Multiemployer plans also would be required, under the amendment, to send annual notices to all participants disclosing the funding status of the plan. This is an important reform. It will mean that we will have transparency in multiemployer programs--something we don't have today--so employees can find out the status of their plans. This reform will have a very positive impact. Without this relief, many companies participating in multiemployer plans will face significant taxes and monetary penalties. This is an attempt to address that problem over the next 2-year period. It is done as a result of pressure which we are seeing within the industry to move out of these types of plans and, in fact, abandon the field of pensions completely in the area of defined benefits plans. We understand that if we do not reform these plans and their funding more substantively over the 2-year hiatus being granted to us, we will have lost a huge opportunity to make available to employees effective pension benefits. Our goal is to make sure we don't arbitrarily force a number of employers out of the pension area simply because we have an artificial rate at which they have to fund their plans; that we don't create an atmosphere where, in the area of airlines and steel, we are essentially forcing these industries into bankruptcy because of their pension structure but, at the same time, not create an atmosphere where we unduly undermine their commitment to their pension structure; thirdly, not create an atmosphere where multiemployers basically abandon the field of pension activity and we end up with many employees not having the opportunity to participate in pensions. That is our goal. Our basic goal is to assure that we have a viable pension system for our employees and the option, as part of that viable pension system, that we have a strong defined benefit element of the system. We know, regrettably, that as we came out of the period of the bubble of the 1990s, tremendous pressure was put on these different pension plans because of their investment exper","word.count":1896,"sep11":2.42415730337079,"years":2004.28370786517,"days":3305,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.566466539660346,"Topic 2":0.264981869164816,"Topic 3":0.0069296755800816,"Topic 4":0.11736036346457,"Topic 5":0.00937647627510994,"Topic 6":0.00452149170633515,"Topic 7":0.00810933377086153,"Topic 8":0.00722311996613318,"Topic 9":0.0106362140253137,"Topic 10":0.00439491638643418},{"id":"10620000000011","body":"Ciro Rodriguez: Mr. Speaker, I believe Elian Gonzalez should be allowed to return to his father.

If they are sincere, if they wish to pursue the evidence on the fire, the fires that have been set, they must separate those cases.","word.count":196,"sep11":-5.38202247191011,"years":1996.47752808989,"days":526,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.105816215088233,"Topic 2":0.197014526382869,"Topic 3":0.0166910186474274,"Topic 4":0.0236690835919477,"Topic 5":0.523760761693323,"Topic 6":0.00640514840131558,"Topic 7":0.00442283272931826,"Topic 8":0.0547706326804875,"Topic 9":0.00596753950484359,"Topic 10":0.0614822412802346},{"id":"11020080059359","body":"Sherrod Brown: Madam President, I was in the House of Representatives for 14 years and have been in the Senate for a year and a half, as has the Presiding Officer. During that time, all of us have noticed when there is a spike in oil prices, as there has been obviously intermittently for decades in this country, we can always ascribe a spike in oil prices to one of several factors: either a major fire in a refinery or there might have been an outage on a pipeline somewhere in our country. It might have come from something such as Hurricane Katrina, some major natural disaster in our country that caused a disruption of oil supplies, or it may have come from an international incident where there would be, again, a disruption in oil getting to our country, some major international incident. So it has either been a refinery fire, pipeline outage, a Katrina-type disaster or some interruption in foreign oil supplies coming to this country. That is what it used to be. The huge increase in oil prices, the fact that since George Bush and Dick Cheney came to the White House, two oilmen in the White House, oil has gone from $30 a barrel to quadruple that number, that gasoline prices have gone from roughly, I believe, no more than a couple dollars a gallon--less than that back then--to about double that now, that has been for different reasons. It is pretty clear, because there has not been a major outage of a pipeline, a refinery fire or a disruption because of a natural disaster or because of a foreign international incident, that something else has happened. That is why Senator Reid's legislation is on the floor today because we know part of the reason for prices doing what they have done is certainly there has been more demand from China and India, but that does not account for the doubling and tripling of prices when, in fact, so much of this is about the issues of gaming the system by the oil industry, whether it is price fixing in some sort of way that the Justice Department should go after or mostly what this bill is about, speculation. It is clear that kind of hanky-panky has gone on in the oil market. You don't have to look very far to figure that out, that it is not just a question of supply and demand. The other factor compounding this--even though I hear my friends on the Republican side of the aisle talk about we need to do more drilling, and I am fine with that. But the fact is there are 68 million acres out there--2\\1/2\\ times the size of my State, the State of Ohio, 2\\1/2\\ times the number of acres of the State of Ohio--there are 68 million acres on which the oil companies have leases. Yet they are not drilling in most of those 68 million acres. If they are committed to producing more oil to bring prices down, they would begin drilling in far more of those acres than they talk about drilling in. So why should we, again, in this institution, the Senate, and as I saw for years in the House, buckle to the oil industry? Why should big oil always have its way here? Why should Wall Street always have its way here? That is why Senator Reid's bill on speculation is so important, empowering the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, empowering the Justice Department to go after the oil industry on price gouging. It is clear we need a more aggressive Federal Government, a more aggressive administration. Again, we have had two oilmen in the White House. Look what happened in these 8 years to oil prices. I beseech my colleagues to support Senator Reid's speculation bill, and I beseech the President to be more aggressive with his Justice Department to go after the oil companies that are price gouging and to empower the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to go after Wall Street on some of this speculation. It is pretty clear that is the biggest reason for these price increases, and it is important the Federal Government get behind efforts to do all we can to rein in the cost of oil for truckers, for motorists, people who are getting squeezed and hurt so badly by these increasing oil prices. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.","word.count":741,"sep11":7.04494382022472,"years":2008.90449438202,"days":4950,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.918589568988552,"Topic 2":0.0269523251217946,"Topic 3":0.00540710546512956,"Topic 4":0.0156390387059001,"Topic 5":0.00557888960853227,"Topic 6":0.00570371558838228,"Topic 7":0.00446596984541209,"Topic 8":0.00958812126712468,"Topic 9":0.00572116598555608,"Topic 10":0.0023540994236157},{"id":"10419950051805","body":"Randy Tate: Mr. President, I would like to announce for the information of the Senate and the public that a hearing has been scheduled before the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to review the socioeconomic impacts of the Department of the Interior's regulatory requirements and planning process.

Obviously, it was very difficult to meet all the needs with the allocation that we had. The final product that we put out was $1.7 billion under the President's request. Now, that is $1.7 billion that we are not loading on to future generations. What that means is that, when young people in the next century, soon to be upon us, want to borrow money to buy a house, it will be at a reasonable interest rate instead of an inflated rate. If we can reduce the deficit and ensure to the marketplace that we are going to achieve a balanced budget over the next 7 years, I think we would see a dramatic decrease in interest rates. Even now, of course, that translates into jobs, as people start businesses, as they expand businesses, as we gain a larger share of the export market because the cost of production is reduced by not having the high overhead of interest rates, and I remember the late 1970's when we were up at something like 21 percent. So the potential benefits are enormous. Mr. Speaker, in structuring the interior bill, we did all that we could to make our contribution. We divided our responsibilities into must-do's, need-to-do's and nice-to-do's. On the must-do's, we kept the funding for the parks flat, a little bit of increase but relatively flat, and said manage it better. They are doing that. We did the same thing with the forests. The cut of timber we allowed was at the President's number. So it was not a case of cutting below in that instance because we recognized that the availability of timber is very important, wood for housing. When we had the bill on initially, I had a piece of 2-by-4 to illustrate what has happened to prices for lumber, and this affects of course the price that young people need to pay when they build or buy a house. So I think what we tried to do was recognize that the agencies that dealt with people, the parks, the forests, fish and wildlife facilities, BLM, and they also have a lot of facilities that are used by people on a multiple use basis, we kept that funding level so they would have the people and the ability to respond. We eliminated the Bureau of Mines. I noticed in the President's 1997 budget he takes credit for eliminating Bureau of Mines, which we have done already in 1996. He has become a budget cutter. What we did is took care of the things that we had to do on the must- do's. We finished facilities that were under way because that was important. If there was a repairs, for example, we put--and this has just been recently--$2 million in the CR to take care of the C&amp;O Canal because thousands of people enjoy that every week. Those sorts of things are must-do's. Now when we got the nice-to-do's, build new visitor centers, buy more land, we did not do it because let us take care of what we have. Mr. Speaker, all I am saying is that we are trying to be responsive and be reasonable and to get the job done but not do it at the expense of loading an enormous burden of debt on future generations. I think they will thank us for it when they go to buy that house and maybe get a mortgage at 5 percent instead of 8, 9, or 10 percent. They will thank us when they are not saddled with all the costs that go with the debt burden that this Government has.","word.count":635,"sep11":-5.61797752808989,"years":1996.24157303371,"days":442,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0387387183457428,"Topic 2":0.0407989022591955,"Topic 3":0.521984779616403,"Topic 4":0.0194338473795724,"Topic 5":0.332438226474979,"Topic 6":0.0087417547476543,"Topic 7":0.00291347070368723,"Topic 8":0.0176434267738403,"Topic 9":0.00804923396259941,"Topic 10":0.00925763973632506},{"id":"10920050002875","body":"Frank Pallone: The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas that the House suspend the rules and pass the Senate bill, S. 1578.

Fong. This is a fitting tribute for a man who was a great statesman, businessman and community leader. Senator Fong was born on October 15, 1906, in Kalihi. He was the seventh of 11 children in an immigrant family. A firm believer of standing on his own feet, he worked numerous odd jobs while in public school in order to help support his family. He worked his way through the University of Hawaii where he graduated with honors in 1930. He went on to Harvard Law School and became the state and county Deputy Attorney General of Honolulu for three years. At the age of 31, Senator Fong began his public service career by serving in Hawaii's Territorial House of Representatives. His ability to work well with both Democrats and Republicans was quickly identified and he was elected Speaker of the House during his first term in office. In 1959, he was elected to the first of three consecutive terms in the U.S. Senate. Senator Fong never forgot his humble beginnings and was an ardent supporter of labor rights. Despite being a Republican, Senator Fong enjoyed widespread support from the labor unions, particularly the International Longshore and Warehouse Union which endorsed Senator Fong's candidacy to Congress and campaigned for his reelection. Senator Fong played an integral role in Hawaii becoming the 50th state and worked on many landmark laws such as the authorization of the Interstate Highway System and the establishment of the East-West Center. Senator Fong's work and leadership will impact generations to come and it is with great honor that I rise to support S. 2089 in recognition of his leadership and service to this country.

I am very pleased to be working with him on this issue, and admire his dedication to fiscal responsibility as embodied in this measure. As the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Smith, and I introduce this bill, we realize that Corps Reform is a work in progress. Reforming the Corps of Engineers will be a difficult task for Congress. It involves restoring credibility and accountability to a Federal agency rocked by scandals and constrained by endlessly growing authorizations and a gloomy Federal fiscal picture, and yet an agency that Wisconsin, and many other States across the country, have come to rely upon. From the Great Lakes to the mighty Mississippi, the Corps is involved in providing aids to navigation, environmental remediation, water control and a variety of other services to my state. My office has strong working relationships with the Detroit, Rock Island, and St. Paul District Offices that service Wisconsin, and I want the fiscal and management cloud over the Corps to dissipate so that the Corps can continue to contribute to our environment and our economy. This legislation evolved from my experience in seeking to offer an amendment to the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 to create independent review of Army Corps of Engineers' projects. In response to my initiative, the bill's managers, which included the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Smith, and the then Chairman, the Senator from Montana, Mr. Baucus, adopted an amendment as part of their Manager's Package which should help get the Authorizing Committee, the Environment and Public Works Committee, the additional information it needs to develop and refine legislation on this issue through a study by the National Academy of Sciences, NAS, on peer review. Earlier this Congress, I introduced the Corps of Engineers Reform Act of 2001, S. 646. The measure the Senator from New Hampshire and I introduce today includes many provisions that were included in my original bill, and codifies the idea of independent review of the Corps about which we agreed in the 2000 Water Resources bill. It also provides a mechanism to speed up completion of construction for good Corps projects with large public benefits by deauthorizing low priority and economically wasteful projects. The bill put forward bold concepts. It streamlines the existing automatic deauthorization process. Under the bill a project authorized for construction but never started is deauthorized if it is denied appropriations funds towards completion of construction for five straight years. In addition, a project that has begun construction but denied appropriations funds towards completion for three straight years. The bill also preserves Congressional prerogative over setting the Corps' construction priorities by allowing Congress a chance to reauthorize any of these projects before they are automatically deauthorized. This process will be transparently to all interests, because the bill requires the Corps to make an annual list of projects in the construction backlog available to Congress and the public at large via the Internet. The bill also allows a point of order to be raised in the Senate against projects included in legislation for which the Corps has not completed necessary studies determining that a project is economically justified and in the federal interest. The Senator from New Hampshire and I came to a meeting of the minds on the issue of independent review of Corps projects. But the bill we introduce today is much more than that. It is a comprehensive revision of the project review and authorization procedures at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Our joint goal is to have the Corps to increase transparency and accountability, to ensure fiscal responsibility, and to allow greater stakeholder involvement in their projects. We are committed to that goal, and to seeing Corps Reform enacted as part of this year's Water Resources bill. I also look forward, to the upcoming hearing process, and stand ready to work with the Senator from New Hampshire in merging the bill we introduce today with S. 646, my bill from earlier this Congress. My bill, S. 646, which is sponsored in the other body by my colleague from Wisconsin, Representative Kind, includes a number of important concepts that are central to environmental protection and that should be part of Corps Reform. The Corps is required to mitigate the environmental impacts of its projects in a variety of ways, including by avoiding damaging wetlands in the first place and either holding other lands or constructing wetlands elsewhere when it cannot avoid destroying them. The Corps requires private developers to meet this standard when they construct projects as a condition of receiving a federal permit, and I think the federal government should live up to the same standards. Too often, the Corps does not complete required mitigation and enhances environmental risks. I feel very strongly that mitigation must be completed, that the true costs of mitigation should be accounted for in Corps projects, and that the public should be able to track the progress of mitigation projects. In addition, the concurrent mitigation requirements of S. 646 would actually reduce the total mitigation costs by ensuring the purchase of mitigation lands as soon as possible. I look forward to exploring these ideas with the Senator from New Hampshire as we work to produce a final product. I feel that this bill is an important step down the road to a reformed Corps of Engineers. This bill establishes a framework to catch mistakes by Corps planners, deter any potential bad behavior by Corps officials to justify questionable projects, end old unjustified projects, and provide planners desperately needed support against the never ending pressure of project boosters. Those boosters, include Congressional interests, which is why I believe that this body needs to champion reform--to end the perception that Corps projects are all pork and no substance. I wish it were the case, that I could argue that the changes we are proposing today were not needed, but unfortunately, I see that there is need for this bill. I want to make sure that future Corps projects no longer fail to produce predicted benefits, stop costing the taxpayers more than the Corps estimated, do not have unanticipated environmental impacts, and are built in an environmentally compatible way. This bill will help the Corps do a better job which is what the taxpayers and the environment deserve. S. 1988.

Despite the wishes of the bill's promoters, our United States Constitution does in fact guarantee American women the right to choose an abortion. And while this bill does not directly overturn Roe v. Wade, it might as well for many women do that since it will make access to abortion impossible for them. To talk about this as a technical change is simply cynical. This is one of the most dangerous attempts to restrict a woman's right to choose, including her right to information and services regarding her reproductive health. H.R. 4691 would allow an HMO or a health insurance company to decide for any reason whatsoever that it will no longer pay for, provide information or even make referrals for abortion services even if the woman's life is endangered or she is a victim of rape or incest. Under this bill, it would be impossible for a State to ensure that women who are victims of rape or incest or whose life is threatened would have access to abortions. In this world today, there are decreasing options for everyone in choosing health insurance companies or HMOs. So are we going to leave it, then, to an employer to decide whether or not a woman would have a right to choose in essence because that HMO would deny them access to the abortion? And in rural areas where there may be only one option for a woman to go, she is denied that opportunity to have her full health services available to her. What this bill really does is allow any health care entity to ignore all Federal, State and local laws pertaining to abortion services, information and referrals. It is not a conscience clause as some would like to call it, as if HMOs have a conscience. In fact, there are no Federal laws that currently exist that require any individuals or hospitals to provide abortions. But this bill would restrict a doctor's rights; that is, his right if he believes in his medical judgment or in his conscience that it is his responsibility to provide those services, he could not do that. So this does limit the right of doctors not to be forced to perform it but to be forced not to perform abortions. Women in this country need to be able to trust that when they go to a doctor with a problem or a condition that they will be given all information necessary to make informed decisions. But this bill would gag doctors. Informed consent as a minimum is a valued and expected component of our health care system. So why do we think that when it comes to women's health it is okay to throw even this concept out the window? This is unacceptable.

My friend has served in the Senate since 1977, which makes him the longest serving United States Senator from Maryland. It has been a pleasure working with Senator Sarbanes over the years on a number of issues. In 2001, I was fortunate to be added to the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee. At that time, the Senator from Maryland was serving as the chairman of the committee and it was a memorable session to be a part of the committee. In the wake of the accounting failures of Enron and other public companies, Chairman Sarbanes conducted a very thorough series of hearings which led to the legislation which is now known as Sarbanes-Oxley. This is landmark legislation that has increased corporate responsibility and resulted in more effective oversight of public companies. Without the vision, courage, and ability of my friend from Maryland, that legislation would not have been possible. Despite numerous obstacles, he brought about comprehensive accounting reform. In addition, I have enjoyed working closely with the Senator from Maryland in trying to improve the financial literacy of our country. Rising health care costs and insurance premiums and the lack of affordable housing have contributed to making the lives of working families more difficult as they strain to meet their day-to-day needs. The ability of families to meet their increasing financial obligations is hampered by their significant debt burdens, particularly credit card debt, and by predatory lending practices such as refund anticipation loans. A lack of financial literacy makes it harder for families to deal with the difficult decisions they are confronted with daily. Senator Sarbanes organized the first set of hearings on the issue of financial literacy and led the creation of the Financial Literacy and Education Commission, the purpose of which is to promote financial literacy and education among all American consumers. Senator Sarbanes has been a champion for Federal employees. Throughout his Senate career, he has fought to ensure that Federal employees and members of the military receive equal pay increases. He understands that the Federal civilian workforce plays a significant role in the support of our Armed Services, and I am honored to join him annually in offering a resolution calling for pay parity between the military and Federal workers. He has been a leading advocate for consumer protection, increasing access to affordable housing, and improving public transportation in our country. I will miss having my good friend from Maryland in the Senate. He has served Maryland and the country very well. Millie and I wish him and his family the very best.","word.count":451,"sep11":5.37078651685393,"years":2007.23033707865,"days":4354,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0138670704892849,"Topic 2":0.212390846125311,"Topic 3":0.0073412578476448,"Topic 4":0.00990737185500163,"Topic 5":0.00784527433771106,"Topic 6":0.0082767079512193,"Topic 7":0.00655214904122027,"Topic 8":0.0314116169750237,"Topic 9":0.696815997700479,"Topic 10":0.00559170767710457},{"id":"10920050020721","body":"Earl Blumenauer: This will be a 2-minute vote The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--ayes 63, noes 356, not voting 13, as follows:","word.count":156,"sep11":3.89606741573034,"years":2005.75561797753,"days":3829,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.746514949327888,"Topic 2":0.0844070894213396,"Topic 3":0.0183637780457605,"Topic 4":0.0390154274246368,"Topic 5":0.0187238754093806,"Topic 6":0.0175150798849644,"Topic 7":0.0146157205104219,"Topic 8":0.0319025652509988,"Topic 9":0.0203689196321107,"Topic 10":0.00857259509249873},{"id":"10620000029706","body":"William Goodling: Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time.

Obviously, the hour is late, but I listened with a degree of interest and care to the comments of the Senator from Idaho. And we have this debate sometimes that centers around whether the glass is half empty or half full. And we are looking at the same matrix, but I see it differently. I do not see a nation out of control. I do not see an economy that is in great jeopardy. I do not despair over what is taking place in our economic structure. Yes, we are paying more taxes in total, but that is because people's incomes have gone up and thus they are paying a larger share of the tax burden than they used to pay. But when we look at a time when the unemployment rate compares to all-time lows, when we see inflation so well controlled, when we see the investment climate in our country so appetizing, no one knows when this is going to change, but the fact of the matter is, lots of people, lots of hard-working, what we will call modest-income people, have made good returns on their investments. And, Lord willing, they will be protected. But why is all that taking place? Why has the stock market galloped up like it has? It is not simply because there is some kind of a speculation fever out there. A lot of it has to do with the fact that the United States is the most attractive investment country in the world. People feel secure. They know if they invest in America that they have a better chance of keeping their money safe and getting a return than any other place because of the structure of our financial being. We cannot ignore these things. I share the Senator's view. I would like to see us paying off the debt. I am one of those who said, yes, I want to shore up Social Security. And how are we going to do it? We are going to do it by paying down the debt. The President has forecast over $1 trillion worth of surpluses over the next 10 years. That is a pretty encouraging prediction. So, I hope we will continue this debate on the morrow, because I think there are other people here who would also want to comment. Mr. President, I do not think we ought to ever lock ourselves into straitjackets to say that you cannot do this unless you do that. We are sent here to exercise judgment. And when I hear the speeches of some of my colleagues, I say, well, we sound like a bunch of recalcitrant children who have to be locked in a corner or put in our seats, or we are so bad--why can't we control ourselves? I do not see it that way. I must tell you, I have great respect for those that I disagree deeply with here. They are sent here to represent a constituency who thinks that these people, the Senators in this Chamber, are going to carry a point of view that they share. And if not, there is a test that comes every 6 years. And you can see what happens. You have either passed the test or you have flunked it; it is very decisive. But with all of that, I just do not see this, if I might call it, self-flagellation, this beating of ourselves. Look at the facts. The economy is really good. I know that I feel better about my children's future now than I did a few years ago. I think we have proven one thing. And some would say, well, we have not, Alan Greenspan has. He is part of our crowd, whether we think we are in his league or not. The fact of the matter is, we have inflation under control--something that was hard to believe could be done, and has not caused deflation, has not caused a crisis. Things are going along very well. So I hope, Mr. President, we will have a chance to chat about this a little bit tomorrow, and I hope we will be able to encourage our colleagues to vote against the Craig amendment, to say that we do not have to put on the handcuffs and apologize for our behavior. I do not think I do everything right, but I know one thing: I work at what I do. And so does everybody else here. I do not think there is anybody here who shirks their responsibility, who does not take it seriously. And I do not think I have to be put in a corner like a child and told, well, you are not going to be allowed to do this unless you do that; you are not going to be allowed to spend money. How do we know when the crisis is coming? We have done the things we said we ought to do. We have a balanced budget. I think we are all proud of that. We can argue whether it is CBO balanced. We say, yes it is. We all kind of believe that on a unified budget basis we are going to be seeing a slight surplus in the very short period. So I hope our colleagues will stand up and say no to limiting our ability to use our heads, to use our judgment, to take the risk of our votes and to see if we can do things without limiting our ability to act.

I can only say, one cannot overestimate my lack of influence with some of the institutions around here. In any event, I am pleased that the Committee on the Judiciary, after a 3-day markup in May, favorably reported bankruptcy reform legislation designed to address deficiencies in current bankruptcy processes and mitigate adverse impacts of bankruptcy filings. We recognized the importance of responding to the many developments since the Bankruptcy Code's enactment a generation ago, including a burgeoning bankruptcy case load that reached a new high of over 1.4 million filings during the 1997 calendar year. Last September, our colleague, the gentleman from Florida , introduced H.R. 2500, the Responsible Borrower Protection Bankruptcy Act, a bill designed in part to implement the concept of needs-based bankruptcy. In February the chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law, the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania , built on this approach by introducing H.R. 3150, the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1998. H.R. 3150 incorporated, with modifications and additions, most of H.R. 2500's consumer bankruptcy provisions while also addressing other bankruptcy related subjects. Our committee sought to achieve an appropriate balance between debtor and creditor rights in endorsing a needs-based bankruptcy process that would increase creditor recoveries while offering relief to deserving debtors. Those who needed an immediate fresh start would get it, but those who could afford to pay a substantial portion of their obligations out of future income before getting a fresh start would be required to do so. Under H.R. 3150 as reported, individuals or couples with income levels equaling or exceeding national median figures that take into account family size may be ineligible, depending on certain calculations, to be chapter 7 debtors. Chapter 7 offers a fresh start, without encumbering future income, to individual debtors who are prepared to give up all of their nonexempt assets. Those denied access to chapter 7 under the pending legislation generally will have the option of making payments under a chapter 13 plan for a number of years and qualifying for a limited discharge eventually. The chapter 7 disqualification is more limited in scope as a result of committee action raising the income threshold for disqualification from 75 percent to 100 percent of national median income figures. The higher cutoff point, endorsed by the committee, addresses a major argument of opponents of this legislation that the needs-based formula was too harsh in its treatment of people with very limited means. Our committee sought to ensure that family support obligations would be protected under the reported version of the bill. It adopted an amendment that I offered to prevent any dilution of the priority treatment accorded claims of spouses, former spouses and children for alimony, maintenance, or support, and also adopted four family support related amendments offered by the learned gentleman from Virginia . Although this legislation was never intended to derogate from the preferred treatment of family support obligations under bankruptcy law, the Committee on the Judiciary welcomed the opportunity to take action emphasizing, in a number of contexts, its firm commitment to facilitating the fulfillment of such obligations. In addition, as a result of a provision in the manager's amendment, the priority in distribution for support related obligations is substantially enhanced compared with current law. I wish to commend the gentleman from Pennsylvania for introducing H.R. 3150 and conducting important hearings on bankruptcy reform in his subcommittee. He is performing, as he does so often, an important public service by serving as our floor manager for this bill. The remedial legislation before us not only covers consumer issues but also addresses business bankruptcy, tax related issues in bankruptcy, and transnational bankruptcy. It merits the support of this body. I hope in the months ahead we will be able to point to bankruptcy reform as one of the significant achievements on a bipartisan basis of the 105th Congress.","word.count":655,"sep11":-3.33988764044944,"years":1998.51966292135,"days":1253,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.101568898396036,"Topic 2":0.560514529391482,"Topic 3":0.00428315466810836,"Topic 4":0.0222230153203008,"Topic 5":0.0471401738484123,"Topic 6":0.00526611748285329,"Topic 7":0.245236645017636,"Topic 8":0.00325102299782719,"Topic 9":0.00867551645354539,"Topic 10":0.00184092642379819},{"id":"10419950070497","body":"Bob Goodlatte: Madam President, thank you very much The case of Jason Allen is not an isolated case.

We have faced hard decisions about peace and war, rising competition in the world economy, and the health and welfare of our citizens. These issues call for vigorous debate, and I think it's fair to say we've answered that call. Yet history will record that amid our differences, we acted with purpose. And together, we showed the world the power and resilience of American self-government. All of us were sent to Washington to carry out the people's business. That is the purpose of this body. It is the meaning of our oath. And it remains our charge to keep. The actions of the 110th Congress will affect the security and prosperity of our Nation long after this session has ended. In this election year, let us show our fellow Americans that we recognize our responsibilities and are determined to meet them. And let us show them that Republicans and Democrats can compete for votes and cooperate for results at the same time. From expanding opportunity to protecting our country, we have made good progress. Yet we have unfinished business before us, and the American people expect us to get it done. In the work ahead, we must be guided by the philosophy that made our Nation great. As Americans, we believe in the power of individuals to determine their destiny and shape the course of history. We believe that the most reliable guide for our country is the collective wisdom of ordinary citizens. So in all we do, we must trust in the ability of free people to make wise decisions, and empower them to improve their lives and their futures. To build a prosperous future, we must trust people with their own money and empower them to grow our economy. As we meet tonight, our economy is undergoing a period of uncertainty. America has added jobs for a record 52 straight months, but jobs are now growing at a slower pace. Wages are up, but so are prices for food and gas. Exports are rising, but the housing market has declined. And at kitchen tables across our country, there is concern about our economic future. In the long run, Americans can be confident about our economic growth. But in the short run, we can all see that growth is slowing. So last week, my Administration reached agreement with Speaker Pelosi and Republican Leader Boehner on a robust growth package that includes tax relief for individuals and families and incentives for business investment. The temptation will be to load up the bill. That would delay it or derail it, and neither option is acceptable. This is a good agreement that will keep our economy growing and our people working. And this Congress must pass it as soon as possible. We have other work to do on taxes. Unless the Congress acts, most of the tax relief we have delivered over the past 7 years will be taken away. Some in Washington argue that letting tax relief expire is not a tax increase. Try explaining that to 116 million American taxpayers who would see their taxes rise by an average of $1,800. Others have said they would personally be happy to pay higher taxes. I welcome their enthusiasm, and I am pleased to report that the IRS accepts both checks and money orders. Most Americans think their taxes are high enough. With all the other pressures on their finances, American families should not have to worry about the Federal Government taking a bigger bite out of their paychecks. There is only one way to eliminate this uncertainty: make the tax relief permanent. And Members of Congress should know: If any bill raising taxes reaches my desk, I will veto it. Just as we trust Americans with their own money, we need to earn their trust by spending their tax dollars wisely. Next week, I will send you a budget that terminates or substantially reduces 151 wasteful or bloated programs totaling more than $18 billion. And this budget will keep America on track for a surplus in 2012. American families have to balance their budgets, and so should their Government. The people's trust in their Government is undermined by congressional earmarks--special interest projects that are often snuck in at the last minute, without discussion or debate. Last year, I asked you to voluntarily cut the number and cost of earmarks in half. I also asked you to stop slipping earmarks into committee reports that never even come to a vote. Unfortunately, neither goal was met. So this time, if you send me an appropriations bill that does not cut the number and cost of earmarks in half, I will send it back to you with my veto. And tomorrow, I will issue an Executive Order that directs Federal agencies to ignore any future earmark that is not voted on by the Congress. If these items are truly worth funding, the Congress should debate them in the open and hold a public vote. Our shared responsibilities extend beyond matters of taxes and spending. On housing, we must trust Americans with the responsibility of homeownership and empower them to weather turbulent times in the housing market. My administration brought together the HOPE NOW alliance, which is helping many struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure. The Congress can help even more. Tonight I ask you to pass legislation to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, modernize the Federal Housing Administration, and allow State housing agencies to issue tax- free bonds to help homeowners refinance their mortgages. These are difficult times for many American families, and by taking these steps, we can help more of them keep their homes. To build a future of quality health care, we must trust patients and doctors to make medical decisions and empower them with better information and better options. We share a common goal: making health care more affordable and accessible for all Americans. The best way to achieve that goal is by expanding consumer choice, not government control. So I have proposed ending the bias in the tax code against those who do not get their health insurance through their employer. This one reform would put private coverage within reach for millions, and I call on the Congress to pass it this year. The Congress must also expand health savings accounts, create Association Health Plans for small businesses, promote health information technology, and confront the epidemic of junk medical lawsuits. With all these steps, we will help ensure that decisions about your medical care are made in the privacy of your doctor's office--not in the halls of Congress. On education, we must trust students to learn if given the chance and empower parents to demand results from our schools. In neighborhoods across our country, there are boys and girls with dreams--and a decent education is their only hope of achieving them. Six years ago, we came together to pass the No Child Left Behind Act, and today no one can deny its results. Last year, fourth and eighth graders achieved the highest math scores on record. Reading scores are on the rise. And African-American and Hispanic students posted alltime highs. Now we must work together to increase accountability, add flexibility for States and districts, reduce the number of high school dropouts, and provide extra help for struggling schools. Members of Congress: The No Child Left Behind Act is a bipartisan achievement. It is succeeding. And we owe it to America's children, their parents, and their teachers to strengthen this good law. We must also do more to help children when their schools do not measure up. Thanks to the D.C. Opportunity Scholarships you approved, more than 2,600 of the poorest children in our Nation's capital have found new hope at a faith-based or other non-public school. Sadly, these schools are disappearing at an alarming rate in many of America's inner cities. So I will convene a White House summit aimed at strengthening these lifelines of learning. And to open the doors of these schools to more children, I ask you to support a new $300 million program called Pell Grants for Kids. We have seen how Pell Grants help low-income college students realize their full potential. Together, we have expanded the size and reach of these grants. Now let's apply that same spirit to help liberate poor children trapped in failing public schools. On trade, we must trust American workers to compete with anyone in the world and empower them by opening up new markets overseas. Today, our economic growth increasingly depends on our ability to sell American goods, crops, and services all over the world. So we are working to break down barriers to trade and investment wherever we can. We are working for a successful Doha round of trade talks, and we must complete a good agreement this year. At the same time, we are pursuing opportunities to open up new markets by passing free trade agreements. I thank the Congress for approving a good agreement with Peru. Now I ask you to approve agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. Many products from these nations now enter America duty-free, yet many of our products face steep tariffs in their markets. These agreements will level the playing field. They will give us better access to nearly 100 million customers. And they will support good jobs for the finest workers in the world: those whose products say ``Made in the USA.'' These agreements also promote America's strategic interests. The first agreement that will come before you is with Colombia, a friend of America that is confronting violence and terror and fighting drug traffickers. If we fail to pass this agreement, we will embolden the purveyors of false populism in our hemisphere. So we must come together, pass this agreement, and show our neighbors in the region that democracy leads to a better life. Trade brings better jobs, better choices, and better prices. Yet for some Americans, trade can mean losing a job, and the Federal Government has a responsibility to help. I ask the Congress to reauthorize and reform trade adjustment assistance, so we can help these ","word.count":5722,"sep11":6.54494382022472,"years":2008.40449438202,"days":4772,"party":"Other","chamber":"","Topic 1":0.206265602509373,"Topic 2":0.00991053480043439,"Topic 3":0.0339033297190456,"Topic 4":0.0449882835770902,"Topic 5":0.0295431963911421,"Topic 6":0.00887772250353718,"Topic 7":0.254568227811069,"Topic 8":0.297669953131855,"Topic 9":0.0364497784258797,"Topic 10":0.0778233711305733},{"id":"10720010069052","body":"Craig Thomas: Mr. President, I want to follow up a bit on what my friend from Arizona has talked about. Certainly, each of us recognizes that things have changed substantially since September 11. I spent the weekend in Cheyenne, WY, and much of it with the National Guard. These great men and women are continuing to carry out their duties in protecting the country, as well as now doing the special things, such as airport security, and other requirements they have. Some have just returned from Bosnia, as a matter of fact. I guess my point is, things changed for all of us; and special things come up at times such as we are in now. But it is also necessary for us, after we have done the things we have to do for those special times, to go ahead and do the things that we ordinarily have to do. Life goes on, and we have to continue to pursue that. I think very much that is the case now with issues we have before us, special things such as airport security, special things such as the declaration, really, of war on terrorism, which we have done. Those things needed to be done. Now, of course, we need to do appropriations. But we also have to do the mundane things such as the confirmation of judges, the seating of U.S. attorneys, many of whom have a very real role in this matter of domestic terrorism. I, too, believe we have to work these two things out together. I understand the frustration of the leadership in the majority when they are seeking to move things, but I have to remind us, for example, that on July 21, 2000, while objecting to Majority Leader Lott's attempt to proceed with the intelligence authorization bill, the minority leader-- now majority leader--said this: This is what he said as he held up that appropriations bill. Our friend from Nevada, on July 24, while objecting to Senator Lott's repeated attempt to move forward, said: That was as he objected to continuation. We find ourselves in the same position. We need to move forward to do the things that must be done. We need to do the things that are ordinarily done. I suggest we can do those things at the same time.","word.count":384,"sep11":0.0955056179775281,"years":2001.95505617978,"days":2476,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.746514949327888,"Topic 2":0.0844070894213396,"Topic 3":0.0183637780457605,"Topic 4":0.0390154274246368,"Topic 5":0.0187238754093806,"Topic 6":0.0175150798849644,"Topic 7":0.0146157205104219,"Topic 8":0.0319025652509988,"Topic 9":0.0203689196321107,"Topic 10":0.00857259509249873},{"id":"11020070068442","body":"Judd Gregg: The point being, if people pursue courses which we think are important in this country, we basically double the amount of the Pell grant they will get, which is a fairly significant commitment to those individuals.

The second point is that we have heard in the press and we have heard from the other side this idea that we cut education funding by $12 billion in the reconciliation bill 2 years ago. That is a total misstatement. That is an outright--well, it is so incredible, it rises to the ``L'' word. It truly is dishonest to make that statement. What we did was we reduced lenders' benefits under the student loan program by almost $20 billion, and then we took a big chunk of that money and put it back into student aid. So we actually increased student aid by approximately $9 billion in that reconciliation proposal. It was a significant shift of funds from lenders to kids who are going to school. When I read in newspapers such as the Wall Street Journal today, a reporter represented, which is basically the dialogue, the line of the Democratic National Committee that we cut student lending by $12 billion, it makes me angry. I oversaw that. I was not chairman of the committee. Senator Enzi was totally committed to student loans and oversaw this exercise. What we did was the opposite. So the dishonesty of the Democratic National Committee in putting out that type of information, and then the incompetence of the Wall Street Journal reporter for picking it up and saying that we cut student loans by $12 billion is absurd on its face. They wrote whatever the Democratic National Committee handed them as a cheat sheet. We cut lenders' subsidies by $20 billion, put $9 billion into student loans.

The other body has also amended the bill by adding a provision that will enable small inventors living in rural areas greater access to patent information. The first provision of H.R. 1197 amends current law governing plant patent parts. Since 1930 the Patent Act has permitted inventors to obtain plant patents. Individuals wishing to skirt protections available under the law have discovered a loophole, however, by trading in plant parts taken from illegally produced plants. H.R. 1197 closes this loophole by explicitly protecting plant parts to the same extent as plants under the Patent Act. Mr. Speaker, this bill is identical to language that was contained in the omnibus patent legislation which passed earlier in the term. There is no opposition to the bill as it will benefit American patentholders and the plant producers as well who honor their work by paying the necessary royalties. The second provision of the bill simply authorizes the Patent and Trademark Office to develop and implement statewide computer networks with remote library sites, thereby enabling small inventors to have greater access to information in patent and trademark depository libraries.

The Constitution has in it this very significant component that is called the Enumerated Powers Act. It is article II, section 8. It tells us exactly what we are to be about, what we are to do, and what we are not to do. The question you ought to measure us on is: Are we following the U.S. Constitution? Many of the bills Senator Reid just brought forward are well within the bounds of the Enumerated Powers, but many of them are not. Yet we think at a parochial level and a political level about our own reelections and we forget this document that has guided this country so well. My hope is the American people will start demanding that we follow this rule book, this guide book. If we do, not only will we eliminate that $300 billion of waste, fraud, and abuse, we will eliminate another $300 billion worth of programs that do not have any role coming out of the Federal Government, and we will put Government closer and more directly accountable to the very people who are being governed, and that is back at the local and State levels. I will say in finishing up, Senator Reid made several references to the Republican caucus. I will assure him that the vast majority of the members of my caucus do not support my position on authorizations.

This American fought for 50 years, in her own inimitable way, to defend the ideals of our democracy. Mary McGrory was the most elegant political writer I have ever known, and one of the bravest. She loved many things in life: a well-told tale, a good joke, good books, good dogs, orphans, lazy August days in Italy, time with her family in Boston, and almost everything about her Irish-American heritage. Most of all, Mary McGrory loved politics and newspapering. I sometimes thought she had newspaper ink in her veins. She never tired of asking questions, chasing stories or writing truth. I can't count the number of times that I have held press briefings in the hallway just off this floor, surrounded by two or three dozen reporters, all jostling for position. And there, among them, was Mary, reporter's notebook in hand. She was 40, 50 years older than some of the other reporters, but there she was, in the thick of it. She didn't need to be there. She could have asked a colleague to pose her question for her and relay the answer to her. But that was not the way of Mary McGrory. She had an extraordinary eye for the telling detail. She wanted to see and hear things herself, and form her own judgments. President Nixon put her on his enemies list, but many of us adored her. In the last year, a stroke robbed Mary of her legendary ability to find just the right word. But she remained a passionate observer of politics and of life. Many of us hoped that she might regain her mastery of words and resume writing. If anyone could conquer the ravages of a stroke, Mary seemed like a likely candidate. But Mary will live through her words. She was an American treasure. Many times this past year, I have missed Mary's wise voice. I am sure I will miss her often in the future, too. These are hard times for our Nation. We could use Mary's insight, her passionate commitment to peace and her fierce belief in democracy. Fortunately, Mary has left us more than a half-century of extraordinary work--work for which she won a Pulitzer Prize and the respect of untold millions. There is more than enough beauty, wit and wisdom in her words to last a lifetime. I am honored to have known Mary McGrory. My thoughts and prayers are with her family and her many, many friends. We have lost a legend. Mary's cousin, Brian McGrory, is a columnist for the Boston Globe. Last November, he wrote a column for the Washington Post about what he called ``the amazing journey that is Mary McGrory's life'' and ``one of the most important, colorful and enduring newspaper careers that the American public has had the pleasure to experience.''

Mr. President, I rise to submit a resolution recognizing the essential role that nuclear power plays in our national energy policy and to voice support for this remarkable technology. America's nuclear power reactors supply electricity for one in five homes and businesses in the United States and do so affordably, reliably and without producing any emissions. To ensure that nuclear energy's important contribution to our nation continues, we must develop and build new nuclear power plants based on advanced technology and safety features. Our Nation will require 40 percent more energy by 2020, requiring the use of all available energy sources--wind, solar, hydro, natural gas, coal and nuclear energy. Even the most aggressive conservation and energy efficient programs will not satisfy all of our increasing energy needs. We will require significant additional electric generating capacity to meet this rising demand--electricity generation that is absolutely necessary to keep our economy growing. And we must provide this new power while protecting our environment. America's 103 nuclear power reactors provide safe, clean and reliable, baseload electricity around the clock. Over the past 50 years, America's nuclear power plants have posted a safety record that is unrivalled. In addition, nuclear plants produce electricity without producing harmful emissions or greenhouse gases. Nuclear energy is the only major energy source that is both emission- free and expandable. The use of nuclear energy also reduces our dependence on foreign sources of energy. Protecting our Nation's energy independence must remain at the forefront of our energy policy decisions. Since scientists first harnessed the power of the atom for the benefit of mankind, the United States has led the world in the development of nuclear science and technology. With some 29 nuclear reactors under construction in other countries, the United State's leadership role in commercial nuclear power could be diminished. Our scientists, engineers and technicians must research, develop and build new nuclear facilities to keep their skills sharp and further their knowledge. In addition, new plant project also will mean more jobs for those scientists, engineers and technicians, as well as many other trades. America's nuclear power plants contribute to nonproliferation efforts. Through the public-private ``Megatons to Megawatts'' program, which this body has strongly supported, 50 percent of the fuel used in our commercial reactors comes from converted Russian warheads. Nuclear energy also is one of the most efficient means of producing hydrogen, another key to our energy future. Hydrogen will help reduce our dependence on imported petroleum in the transportation sector, and, like nuclear energy, is a clean air energy. Therefore, I call upon my colleagues to join me in support of this resolution recognizing nuclear energy's important contributions to our Nation, such as maintaining our energy independence and protecting our environment. And I urge all of you to join me in supporting research, development and construction of new nuclear power plants today, so that nuclear energy can continue providing these benefits in the future.","word.count":488,"sep11":3.14887640449438,"years":2005.00842696629,"days":3563,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.201065656793217,"Topic 2":0.166153868176067,"Topic 3":0.00569879121631635,"Topic 4":0.203360034859464,"Topic 5":0.00431071686020058,"Topic 6":0.00514041861912947,"Topic 7":0.0288931381672802,"Topic 8":0.0374710930148803,"Topic 9":0.334596586211885,"Topic 10":0.0133096960815597},{"id":"10920050011131","body":"Robert Scott: Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.

At the time, U.S. natural gas prices were the lowest in the industrialized world. Today, U.S. natural gas prices are the highest in the industrialized world. Prices for natural gas continue to increase while the government continues to promote new natural gas consumption. To balance the market, we need to invest in efficient and alternative energy. But we also need to increase access to new sources of supply to keep pace with new sources of demand. The high cost of natural gas has a major impact on both the farm and forest sector. Paper mills, a major employer in my district, are very energy intensive. Energy costs account for 18 percent of the cost of operating a mill, almost eclipsing costs for employee compensation. The impacts have been dramatic. Over 232 paper mills across the country have closed, and 182,000 jobs lost since 2000, when energy prices started a steep rise. For farmers, higher natural gas prices mean higher costs for fertilizers. According to the USDA, average fertilizer prices in March 2006 stood 74 percent higher than their 1990-1992 level, very near all time high records. The Interior appropriations bill begins to address the supply piece of the puzzle to help bring natural gas prices down. We can no longer continue to ban access to large sources of supply, even as we continue to encourage new demand. The bill exempts natural gas from the congressional ban on energy development in the OCS. The ban on oil development remains in place. It allows the Federal Government to begin the process of developing these important resources. The bill's provisions are a starting point. It is the first time in a quarter century that Congress is acknowledging that it can no longer continue to promote natural gas consumption and, at the same time, prohibit more production.

We can no longer continue to ban access to large sources of supply, even as we continue to encourage new demand. The bill exempts natural gas from the Congressional ban on energy development in the OCS. The ban on oil development remains in place. It allows the Federal government to begin the process of developing these important resources. The bill's provisions are a starting point. It is the first time in a quarter century that Congress is acknowledging that it can no longer continue to promote natural gas consumption and, at the same time, prohibit more production. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the amendment.","word.count":106,"sep11":3.75842696629213,"years":2005.61797752809,"days":3780,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.725495925680693,"Topic 2":0.104629614700371,"Topic 3":0.0180714407412356,"Topic 4":0.0236030178468879,"Topic 5":0.0205221959782818,"Topic 6":0.0137853799515606,"Topic 7":0.0182313540082565,"Topic 8":0.0517590936674697,"Topic 9":0.0156036555871496,"Topic 10":0.00829832183809406},{"id":"10519980000517","body":"Joe Moakley: Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend and colleague, the gentleman from New York , for yielding me the customary half-hour, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I know and I realize that there may be a lot of people in this country who think Washington National Airport should be named after President Reagan, but I daresay very few of them live in the area. For that reason, Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this restrictive rule. Because in 1986 there was a bill in which the Federal Government ceded responsibility for managing this airport to the Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority. That bill was signed into law by none other than President Ronald Reagan. Because, Mr. Speaker, President Reagan was a big believer in giving local government more control and the Federal Government less control. In fact, Mr. Speaker, President Reagan himself said, and I quote, this is a quote: But this bill is a complete contradiction of the very philosophy of Ronald Reagan himself. This bill takes a local airport name and says the Federal Government has decided to change the name of this airport despite nearly unanimous local opposition. And I want to add also, Mr. Speaker, that this airport does have a name. It is Washington National Airport, named for our first President, George Washington, who lived just a stone's throw away from where the airport currently stands. The Federal Government has already named the second largest building in Washington after Ronald Reagan, the Ronald Reagan Trade Center. And as far as I am concerned, they can name the largest building in the D.C. area after Ronald Reagan, the Pentagon. It does not have a name. Let us make it the Ronald Reagan Peace Clinic. Mr. Speaker, President Reagan had a profound impact on our country. He was one of the greatest proponents of freedom worldwide. My opposition in renaming the airport has nothing to do with my respect for the former President but, rather, my belief that we should honor his ideas as well as his name. Yesterday afternoon in the Committee on Rules we heard from local representatives, Democrats and Republicans alike. These are the people who speak for this area. These are the people who can speak for the people who live around the airport. Mr. Speaker, every one of them, every one of them asked that the airport not be renamed but remain Washington National Airport after our first President, George Washington. But today it looks like my Republican colleagues are going to continue despite strong local opposition and despite the very principles Ronald Reagan himself stood for. My dear friend, my colleague, the gentleman from New York , said this bill will honor President Ronald Reagan. That is true. But, Mr. Speaker, this bill will dishonor President George Washington. I urge my colleagues to oppose the rule. This imposes a 2-hour time cap on a partisan bill, which we have nothing but time around here, and it does not do anything to credit the memory of a great president, Ronald Reagan. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire from my dear friend how many speakers he has remaining?","word.count":531,"sep11":-3.6938202247191,"years":1998.16573033708,"days":1127,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0218809756372755,"Topic 2":0.0192738060136185,"Topic 3":0.00451608424662573,"Topic 4":0.00536461469046083,"Topic 5":0.0032937869545654,"Topic 6":0.0151570391407569,"Topic 7":0.00650378639047326,"Topic 8":0.109901221815429,"Topic 9":0.808134538192376,"Topic 10":0.00597414691841881},{"id":"11020070054871","body":"Mike Pence: Mr. President, the second piece of legislation I introduce today is the Lower Rogue Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. The Rogue River is a much beloved piece of Oregon's beautiful landscape. This bill will protect the waters that feed it. Protecting the wild and scenic tributaries to the Rogue River is a critical step in protecting the backbone of one of Oregon's most important sport and commercial fisheries. In 2008, the American Rivers Organization named the Rogue and its tributaries as the second most endangered river in our country. I am hoping to change that today by introducing this legislation which would protect 143 miles of wild and scenic tributaries that feed the Rogue River with cold, clean water. The Rogue River is one of our Nation's premier recreation destinations, famous for its free flowing waters which provide numerous rafting and fishing opportunities. The headwaters of this great river start in one of Oregon's other great gems--Crater Lake National Park-- and ultimately empty into the Pacific Ocean near Gold Beach on the Southwest Oregon coast. Along that stretch, the Rogue River flows through one of the most spectacular canyons and diverse natural areas in the United States. The Rogue River is home to runs of coho, spring and fall chinook, winter and summer steelhead--and it has the special distinction of being one of only several rivers in the country with runs of green sturgeon. The Rogue River received its first protections in the original Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, in 1968. A narrow stretch of land was protected along the river banks. Since that time, a great deal has been learned about the importance of protecting the tributaries that feed into the main stem of the Rogue. Protecting the wild and scenic tributaries to the Rogue River is a critical step in protecting the backbone of one of Oregon's most important sport and commercial fisheries. In 2008, American Rivers named the Rogue and its tributaries as the second most endangered river in the U.S. I'm hoping to change that today by introducing legislation to protect this river and its tributaries. My proposal would protect 143 miles of wild and scenic tributaries that feed the Rogue River with cold clean water. The protected tributaries would include Galice Creek, Little Windy Creek, Jenny Creek, Long Gulch--and 36 other tributaries of the Rogue. By protecting the tributaries that feed this mighty river, I will seek to protect the Rogue River for future generations so they can enjoy the Rogue River as we do today. My colleagues in the House of Representatives, Representatives DeFazio, Hooley, Blumenauer and Wu will be introducing companion legislation in the House today. I want to express my thanks to the conservation and business communities of Southern Oregon, who have worked diligently to protect these waters and enable the outdoor recreationists to use and enjoy these rivers. I look forward to working with my House colleagues and the bill's other supporters to advance our legislation to the President's desk. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: S. 3151.

Through her work as a teacher and provider to the poor and suffering, Mother Teresa of Calcutta demonstrated the essence of what it means to love. It was March of 2002 that I was humbled and privileged during a personal visit to the Nirmal Hriday, Pure of Heart, Home for the Dying Destitutes in Calcutta, started by Mother Teresa in 1952 to give hope and care to those with neither. Although Mother Teresa passed away 5 years earlier, the spirit of kindness and concern that nearly transcended human boundaries lived on in that small hospice, and showed on the faces of its volunteers, and shined in the smiles of nuns carrying on her work. That day I was also honored to visit with Mother Teresa's successor, Sister Nirmala. Sister Nirmala and I spoke briefly of the importance of continuing Mother Teresa's work, and in some small way, I hope the recognition we provide will further that cause--that comfort, care, and love she gave unconditionally. Born in 1910, Mother Teresa became a Roman Catholic nun at the age of 18. She began by teaching geography and history at St. Mary's School in Calcutta, but became anxious to aid those outside of the convent. Twenty years later, she founded the Missionaries of Charity, a religious order based on attending to the impoverished and afflicted whom no one else served. Mother Teresa later turned her focus to the establishment of care programs for AIDS victims. Although she was the recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979, as well as the Presidential Medal of Freedom and Foundation for Hospice and Homecare's Lifetime Achievement Award in 1985, Mother Teresa felt most honored by the joy of providing comfort and care to those in need. As her beatification by Pope John Paul II nears, we pause to reflect upon the example set forth by Mother Teresa of Calcutta. Mother Teresa demonstrated true and unconditional love for her fellow persons, giving herself fully to their care, and shall forever be remembered as one of the world's most generous and inspiring human beings.","word.count":369,"sep11":2.14325842696629,"years":2004.00280898876,"days":3205,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.01842401134412,"Topic 2":0.445070138995431,"Topic 3":0.0354858989488073,"Topic 4":0.28205070398766,"Topic 5":0.11253753570566,"Topic 6":0.00196694464224624,"Topic 7":0.00400404466476495,"Topic 8":0.0210813460748562,"Topic 9":0.0714379006798943,"Topic 10":0.00794147495656051},{"id":"10419950075548","body":"Dirk Kempthorne: I thank my chairman for yielding to me Let me close with this thought.

Res. 1071 provides for consideration of H.R. 4847, the United States Fire Administration Reauthorization Act of 2008 under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate, controlled by the Committee on Science and Technology, and makes in order all three amendments that were submitted for consideration. I am proud to rise today in support of this rule and the underlying bill. Mr. Speaker, twenty-seven years ago, in 1971, over 12,000 citizens and more than 250 firefighters tragically lost their lives due to fires. In response to those tragic occurrences, this body passed the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act into law, establishing the United States Fire Administration, also known as the USFA, and the National Fire Academy, known as the NFA. The USFA was created to reduce the incidence of death, injury and property loss from fire through public education, data collection, research and training. Mr. Speaker, we have made great progress. Since the creation of the USFA in 1974, the number of fire deaths has been reduced by more than one-half. Besides providing training and educational programs for over 30,000 fire departments across this great Nation, the USFA promotes fire safety and prevention programs to the public. Mr. Speaker, these educational and outreach programs undoubtedly have saved thousands of lives and thousands of dollars, and will continue to do so. Reports published by the USFA provide essential information to help reduce the risk of fires. For example, the USFA releases a report in December to encourage fire safety during the holiday season. According to last year's report, ``Fires occurring during the holiday season claimed the lives of over 400 people, injured more than 1,650, and caused $990 million in damage.'' The report outlines precautionary tests to help American families avoid devastating but often preventable accidents. The USFA also collects reliable data on civilian and firefighter deaths and injuries. In 2006, there were 3,245 civilian deaths from fires and 81 percent of all civilian fire deaths occurred in residences, which represents 25 percent of all fires. Direct property loss due to fires was approximately $11.3 billion, $755 million of which was the result of 31,000 intentionally-set structure fires. Mr. Speaker, sadly, 106 firefighters were killed in the line of duty in 2006. For nearly 30 years, the USFA has collected data on the number and causes of firefighter fatalities. The analysis of this invaluable research allows the USFA to find solutions to specific problems and reduce the number of fatalities with our firefighters. While the number of firefighter deaths has been greatly reduced, approximately 100 brave firefighters make the ultimate sacrifice to protect our loved ones and our communities each year. We must continue to strive to prevent fires, to learn the lessons from unpreventable fires, and to properly train and equip our firefighters. It is vital that our Federal Government ensure that our brave firefighters have the training and the support they need to keep our families and communities safe. Mr. Speaker, this reauthorization bill will promote national consensus standards for safe fire fighting at all levels of Government. H.R. 4847 will also help to provide training for firefighters who are increasingly called on to handle modern-day challenges and catastrophes, including fire fighting in the wildland-urban interface and responding to hazardous material incidents. Firefighters are the first on the scene and the last to leave. Captain Robert Livingston echoed these sentiments in his testimony before the House Subcommittee on Technology and Innovation when he said, ``The days of firefighters whose primary function was to `put the wet stuff on the red stuff' are long gone. The men and women of the 21st century fire service have evolved into highly-trained, highly- skilled all-purpose emergency responders with broad responsibilities.'' Firefighters in my district know this all too well. With the recent and reoccurring damaging floods in cities like Barberton, North Royalton, Elyria and Lorain, our firefighters have been called upon to provide emergency flood assistance. And we must never forget, Mr. Speaker, the heroics our Nation witnessed on September 11th as these brave men and women ran into the Twin Towers to save as many people as possible. Three hundred forty-one of New York City's finest firefighters, three fire safety directors, two paramedics and one volunteer firefighter died in the line of duty at the World Trade Center on that fatal day. It is our responsibility to provide the resources necessary to train those who protect us, and today, with passage of this act, we will be providing the support to meet the needs of our firefighters for the 21st century. By reauthorizing and improving this act, we are ensuring that the USFA continues to provide training, education and the tools to the firefighters we entrust to protect our communities and our families. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.","word.count":334,"sep11":5.56741573033708,"years":2007.42696629213,"days":4424,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.00462974619620722,"Topic 2":0.287490770656809,"Topic 3":0.174625855593768,"Topic 4":0.00120846136220402,"Topic 5":0.0394966746303034,"Topic 6":0.476624515385834,"Topic 7":0.00754007565127423,"Topic 8":0.00218425260711104,"Topic 9":0.00222921251513955,"Topic 10":0.0039704354013493},{"id":"10419950059910","body":"J.D.

I think this amendment is a moderate, measured approach to medical liability reform. It is very difficult for us to debate any type of liability reform in the Congress, in the Chamber of the Senate or in the House of Representatives, without getting into worst case scenarios. There is none that we are more sensitive regarding, I think, than medical liability reform. I have a great deal of confidence in the Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell] and the Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Lieberman], who have spent a lot of time trying to bring forth the difficult aspects of this issue in the most acceptable consensus that really does give us some successful and constructive results to a problem that really troubles everyone in one way or another. I know that we have already heard some of the specific provisions of the McConnell amendment, but if I may, Mr. President, I would like to reiterate some of them that I think are particularly useful and important to remember. One, that there is full recovery of economic and noneconomic damages. [[Page S5783]] The amendment allows injured patients to recover complete compensatory damages. It places no limitations on the amount claimants may recover for economic damages such as out-of-pocket medical expenses, rehabilitation costs, lost wages, cost of domestic services, and noneconomic damages such as pain and suffering, mental anguish, and loss of companionship. The amendment that is before us currently contains a cap on punitive damages of $250,000 or three times the economic losses, whichever is greater. I understand there are discussions ongoing now with Senator Snowe and others about punitive damages. I would just like to say for myself, Mr. President, whatever agreement can be reached--I think Senator McConnell as well is a party to this--if we can reach an agreement with the chairman, Senator Gorton, on what type of punitive damages language we would want to have, I think there would be strong support for that. So that is still ongoing and debated. There is a limit on attorneys' fees to ensure that injured patients recover a greater share of their medical liability awards. The attorneys' contingency fees are limited to 33\\1/3\\ percent of the first $150,000 award and 25 percent of awards in excess of $150,000. This is identical to the provisions contained in the bill that Senator Kennedy introduced last year. There is also the State alternative dispute resolution. Many in the legal profession and outside the legal profession believe we need to do more to encourage alternative dispute resolution, to promote the resolution of claims in a more convenient and timely--and let me stress timely--manner because years can go by in which most of those who need assistance are frequently tied up in the courts waiting to see what happens. This will be a means of getting a more timely redress and in an affordable manner. The amendment encourages States to experiment with the alternative dispute resolution and requires the U.S. Attorney General to provide technical assistance to States regarding various ADR mechanisms. Finally, thanks to the contributions of Senator Jeffords, the amendment requires the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, in consultation with public and private sector entities, to establish guidelines on quality assurance, patient safety, and consumer information. This is a small step in the right direction and one that has to be taken with some care, but I think we would all agree that a better means of obtaining information for consumers would be beneficial and useful. Much has been said in the Chamber today both pro and con, and I do not like to be repetitive, but I think there are some things that are worth repeating. While we have different thoughts on this, I think all of us are struggling to find some better means of addressing tort reform and answering the problems that exist today in a society in which we have all become so very litigious, that as we weave this web of ever greater litigiousness, I think we are doing a great disservice to those perhaps most in need of redress in the courts. The current liability system carries great human and economic costs. It does not work well for anyone--not for doctors, not for hospitals, not for families, and not for injured patients. Under the present system, it takes an average of 5 years from the time a patient is injured to resolve a malpractice case. That is really inexcusable. The Rand Corp. has found that only 40 cents of every dollar spent in medical liability litigation reaches injured patients. The rest goes to court costs and attorneys' fees. The United States has the world's most expensive tort system. At 2.3 percent of GDP, U.S. tort costs are substantially higher than those of any other country and two and a half times the average of all developed countries. The Harvard Medical Practice Study, based on a review of 31,429 medical records in 51 New York hospitals, found that only 1 in 16 injured patients actually received compensation. On the other hand, the study concluded that half of the malpractice claims that were filed were without merit. Moreover, according to a 1992 survey by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 12.3 percent of the OB/GYN's nationally gave up obstetrics in 1992 as a direct result of liability concerns. I know in my own State of Kansas, it is becoming increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to find obstetricians and gynecologists who will go into the smaller, more rural communities because of the high cost of insurance that they must carry versus the number of patients that they may see. So it becomes an increasingly difficult problem in ways that we perhaps do not realize. I would just like to say a few additional words about the preemption provisions of the McConnell amendment. I know this is a concern to some and I am sympathetic to that. How far do we go at the Federal level to preempt the various State laws that provide, in this case, guidance for litigation? I do not believe there is a need for absolute uniformity in this area. But I do believe it is important to set some very clear, minimum Federal standards that all States must meet. Let me just explain why I think that is important. The amendment does not preempt States from going further with medical malpractice reforms that they may decide are necessary. They may go further. California, for instance, now caps noneconomic damages at $250,000. I think this is the best way to balance the need for some State flexibility with the need for greater certainty and predictability in the system. When I mention California capped noneconomic damages, let me just reiterate, this amendment does not cap noneconomic damages. But California would not be preempted because it would go even further. What this does, to a certain extent, is set a floor below which there could not be changes made and, therefore, it adds a certainty and a predictability that I think will enable cases to be resolved in a timely fashion. Without some sense of specificity, I think we lose this timeliness, lose the ability to move the process forward. I believe that setting a minimum level of medical liability reforms is necessary to continue development of a cost-effective private health care system. Moreover, there is a direct and compelling Federal interest in reforming our outmoded medical liability system. One-third of the total health care spending in this country is paid by the Federal Government through Medicare and Medicaid Programs. Finally, as my colleague, Senator Frist, knows perhaps better than anyone else in this body, health care services are increasingly becoming regional, if not national. Senator Frist from Tennessee was a surgeon prior to his coming to the U.S. Senate. For example, some of the finest medical facilities in the United States, such as the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, Stanford University in California, Barnes Hospital in Missouri, and the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio--and I do not want to leave others out--are examples of important regional centers that treat patients from across the Nation and around the world. That is why, it seems to me, the more we can begin to start with some very important but moderate approaches to medical liability reform, I think we take a big step forward in assuring not only the access and timely access to redress, but we also provide the stability and some assurance of what actually is out there in the way of costs. It should not, in any way, close the doors to those who need redress in the courts. But it should make us all mindful of being able to change the system that is getting out of hand. And in our own responsibility, whether it is here on the floor of the Senate or individually, we have to address and take responsibility for a growing environment that I think creates problems for each and every one of us. Mr. President, I would just like to strongly urge my colleagues to support the McConnell-Lieberman-Kassebaum amendment. I know that we have a somewhat bumpy path ahead on this, but I am hopeful that we can move forward with the debate. Those who object have laid out some of their objections. But I think it is time for us to vote and move forward and get to the heart of the matter. [[Page S5784]] Thank you, Mr. President.

The Republican leadership should be ashamed of itself to be so readily willing to undermine every American citizen's constitutional protection of privacy in order to give some political help to an endangered Republican Congresswoman from New Mexico. This bill gives the executive branch unilateral powers to operate outside of the law. The FISA court has worked well for the past 30 years. Through the issuance of warrants, it provides our intelligence agencies expedited access to listen in on private communications but while safeguarding our civil liberties. The FISA court has refused only four requests for surveillance out of 10,000. Four requests refused out of 10,000. And the Attorney General already has the ability to collect information without a court order in emergency situations. But this bill will retroactively approve the President's wiretapping program, one that our judicial branch has held is illegal. It even allows the Justice Department to coerce telephone companies to give up their records. To date, the administration has never articulated to Congress or the relevant committees why such expansive new authority is necessary. Congress and the American people deserve an answer as to why we should give this President unilateral authority to erode our constitutional rights. Mr. Speaker, we believe that every communication to and from al Qaeda should be monitored. In doing so, however, Congress should not give the executive branch a blank check to expose millions of innocent Americans to warrantless surveillance.

Homeownership is a significant part of the American dream. It has been called the backbone of our economy. It is widely considered the primary means by which American families create middle-class wealth and build financial security. Homeownership is all those things and more. It is the cornerstone of healthy communities across our Nation. It is good for families, good for our schools, good for our neighborhoods. Equity in homes is the leading source for collateral for small business start-up borrowing, and home equity loans are the leading provider of funds for a college education. Some experts even say home owners are more likely to vote. Despite the many benefits, there are still too many Americans for whom the American dream of homeownership is unreachable. There are too many American families who pay rent month after month, never accumulating equity, never experiencing the joy of raising their children in a home they own, and look forward to passing along to future generations. That is especially true among Americans from minority populations. Though nationwide nearly 70 percent of Americans own their own home, homeownership rates among African-Americans and Hispanics is less than 50 percent. There are any number of obstacles to homeownership, but there is one problem that is widely considered the single biggest obstacle: the lack of funds for a down payment. Again, this is disproportionately true among minority families, which frequently have less accumulated wealth that can be used for a down payment. President Bush has proposed creating the American Dream Down Payment Fund, which would provide down payment assistance to 40,000 families every year. I support that effort, and I applaud President Bush for proposing this bold new initiative. The President has set a goal of increasing the number of minority homeowners by at least 5.5 million by the end of this decade, which the Department of Housing and Urban Development estimates would create $256 billion in economic activity. I believe that is an important goal for us as a Nation. I also believe that as we work to find ways for the Federal Government to increase homeownership, we need to encourage the private sector to do the same. There are a number of non-profit organizations in our country doing just that by providing a gift of down payment assistance to potential homeowners. These gifts of down payment assistance go to families and individuals who have the income to afford a mortgage, but who would otherwise be prevented from buying a home because they lack funds for a down payment. Last year non-profit organizations provided gifts of down payment assistance to over 85,000 home buyers--and the number will likely be much higher this year. One organization alone has helped over 160,000 individuals and families become homeowners, by providing a gift of funds for a down payment. And all without collecting a single dime of government funding. That is why I am so pleased to be introducing this legislation today. I want to be sure the private sector can continue playing such a vital role in increasing homeownership by providing down payment assistance. Although many charities holding tax exemptions under section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code provide down payment assistance, IRS regulations do not clearly address down payment assistance programs. Our legislation will clarify that, under certain circumstances, the provision of down payment assistance to American families for use in purchasing low or moderate price homes constitutes charitable activity. Rather than developing our own standard for eligible home purchases, we have relied on the National Housing Act rule for FHA-insured loans. Our provision applies to purchases of a principal residence if the amount of the mortgage is less than the maximum mortgage amount eligible for FHA insurance in the geographic area in which the home is located. That will ensure that a charitable down payment assistance program is not used to support the purchase of rental properties or expensive homes. Our legislation also includes one other provision designed to protect the Treasury. Home sellers often contribute to charitable down payment assistance providers in connection with the sale of a home. Those contributions are used to replenish the pool to make available gift assistance for other home buyers. Although the contributions are being made to a charity, they are not charitable in nature; they are expenses of selling a home. The legislation clarifies that a party to a home sale transaction may not claim a charitable contribution deduction for a contribution to a down payment assistance provider made in connection with the sale. Although IRS regulations do not clearly address down payment assistance programs, our legislation merely codifies current practice. As a result, I do not anticipate that the legislation will result in a significant change in tax revenues. Non-profit providers of down payment assistance help tens of thousands of Americans every year become homeowners. These organizations are changing lives, changing families, changing our communities--and they are doing it all without a single dime of taxpayer funds. I am pleased my colleague from California, Senator Feinstein, has joined me in introducing this legislation. I ask all of my colleagues to join us in this important effort.","word.count":892,"sep11":2.25,"years":2004.1095505618,"days":3243,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.142283388704395,"Topic 2":0.0305825708220028,"Topic 3":0.00900715404472875,"Topic 4":0.00829203165147842,"Topic 5":0.256866724430271,"Topic 6":0.00397762943936308,"Topic 7":0.00485583624558258,"Topic 8":0.150337714937687,"Topic 9":0.0696381198059053,"Topic 10":0.324158829918585},{"id":"10419950105726","body":"Russ Feingold: Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about what has happened with regard to the concurrent budget resolution. The Republican leadership have unveiled their final conference budget proposal. I just have to say that I am appalled at the fiscal irresponsibility that it represents. I, for one, disagree with some other Democrats in that I am glad the President came in with a budget that had a date certain for balancing the budget. I am glad that the Republicans are working on a date certain to balance the budget. I happen to think both of them wait too long. I think it can be done before the year 2000, if you really put everything on the table. I recognize that the President himself has proposed a tax cut-- certainly, a much more modest tax cut than the various Republican proposals. I happen to disagree with any tax cut at this time if we are going to balance the budget as fast as we can, Mr. President. But this agreement last night really takes the cake. It includes a massive, $245 billion tax cut--not the $50 or $60 billion the President was talking about, or $90 billion that some said the process would end up with, but really an unbelievably high figure, at a time when this country has a $5 trillion debt. A $245 billion tax cut over the next 7 years. Mr. President, such a tax cut at this time is so fiscally irresponsible as to be downright reckless. To me, Mr. President, this is not just a budget compromise, it is a compromising of the economic health of the American people. It could not come at a worse time. It could not be more irresponsible. This is a deal cut in the back room by members of one party, which sacrifices the whole principle of fiscal discipline for very shallow political ends, Mr. President. I am afraid the Senate budget conferees have totally caved in to political gamesmanship, Presidential politics, and the Contract With America. I was watching TV this morning. On the Today Show, I saw the Speaker's comment when the reporters asked him what this deal was all about. With a wink, the Speaker said, ``You are going to have more take-home pay. You will like it.'' He knows what he is doing. He is trying to tell the American people they can have their cake and eat it, too. They can have a $245 billion tax cut and a balanced budget by 2002. But the American people know better. They know that cannot be done. In fact, I would almost understand it if this deal was based on a political understanding of what the people in America really want. But I cannot find anywhere in the State of Wisconsin, which I represent, people clamoring for a tax cut. I have been watching this carefully every day since last November. The people of my State, whether Republicans or Democrats, millionaires or working-class people, are not clamoring for tax cuts. They know you cannot have a $245 billion tax cut and balance the budget by 2002 or 2005, or any time in the foreseeable future. So I find this hard to understand. It does not seem to fit politics. It certainly does not fit policy, and certainly does not fit in with our economic needs and the goal of eliminating the deficit. I remember a few months ago that the chair of the other body's Budget Committee went to a town meeting in his district, and he got confirmation that the American people in his district want a balanced budget. He said, ``You folks want a tax cut, too, do you not?'' Guess what, the crowd overwhelmingly told the budget chair in the other body they did not want a tax cut because we need to balance the budget now. Well, the chair of that committee completely ignored the wishes of the people at his town meeting, and he went ahead and joined in this deal to take $245 billion that could be used for deficit reduction and give it particularly to those who are the wealthiest among us. Mr. President, the proposed tax cut jeopardizes not only an opportunity to eliminate the Federal deficit and balance our books, it risks our Nation's economy. Mr. Greenspan and the Federal Reserve may be considering lowering interest rates because of the possibility now of some sort of recession. But a fiscally irresponsible tax cut of $245 billion could put any plans to lower interest rates on hold, and might even lead to an interest rate increase. To accommodate this unnecessary tax cut and to accommodate an unjustified increase of $58 billion, to an already bloated defense budget, this document that was cooked up in the last few days adds to defense and forces draconian cuts in the most important programs in the budget. There are stark parallels between the level of the tax cuts, also, and the proposed cuts to Medicare, Mr. President. The tax cut figure from last night is $245 billion. The Medicare cuts that the Republicans say we have to have is $270 billion. It is not hard to conclude, Mr. President, a very simple proposition: Medicare cuts are being made to fund tax cuts, especially for upper income people. I happen to be one who has said on this floor repeatedly that some cuts in Medicare can be made. Certainly, we can make some cuts in administrative aspects, in some formula-driven overpayments, and other areas. But what this tax cut means is that the very harsh Medicare cuts included in the budget agreement have to happen. They could be reduced significantly, cut in half, or almost completely eliminated, if we did not have this $245 billion tax cut. The same goes for the Medicaid cuts. There has been a lot of talk about Medicare, but what about the impact on the poor because of these $180 billion in Medicaid cuts? You could completely wipe out that cut and still have $65 billion left over if you did not do this irresponsible tax cut. The Senator from Massachusetts has prepared a list here of what the priorities really are represented by the decision to do tax cuts instead of having an earlier balanced budget while taking care of people. The priorities for the Republican agenda here with this big tax are slashing Medicare, slashing education, reducing college opportunities that are already very thin, and lowering wages for working families. Mr. President, we do not even have to have most of the Medicare cuts. We do not have to have the Medicaid cuts. We do not have to have the cuts in student loans, if we use a little willpower and resist the temptation to hand out goodies to people in the form of tax cuts they do not want anyway. Mr. President, this budget imposes devastating cuts to essential programs in order to fund increases to the defense industry. In fact, the way I like to talk about it, there are at least three sacred cows protected by this budget resolution: The first one is the tax cut; a $245 billion sacred cow that could help solve our problems and should be taken care of and eliminated. Second, corporate tax loopholes, growing at a rate of 24 percent, second only to entitlements at 27 percent, are not touched. They are completely protected by this budget resolution. Finally, almost unbelievable to my constituents, the third sacred cow--the Defense Department budget, which not only is not cut, it is actually increased. Everybody in this game at this point says, ``Gee, we have to increase the defense budget at a time when we are trying to balance the Federal budget.'' More important than Medicaid, education, and college is protecting tax loopholes, protecting tax cuts, and giving up more money to the Defense Department. Mr. President, possibly an even greater tragedy of this budget agreement is that it missed an opportunity. This compromise missed maybe the opportunity to set forth the plan to balance the budget that would have had bipartisan support in Congress, and more importantly, broad-based support from the American people. I suppose there is a tiny hope that this budget agreement still could be prevented. I do not hold much hope for it, but there is a chance, nevertheless, if we defeat this irresponsible budget agreement, we could go back to the drawing board. I know we could fashion a budget plan that would have the support of the majority of this body, and in this case the Members on both sides of the aisle. It would be a plan that could achieve a balanced budget not only by the year 2002 or 2000, but even earlier; a plan that would have a very good chance of enacting all the ensuing appropriations and reconciliation bills into law. Most importantly, Mr. President, it would be a plan that would have the support of the American people. I know the votes are there. In their hearts, I think many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle know it, too. If the leadership would allow Senators to do it, I bet we could have a plan drawn up and passed within a week. Of course, that is almost certainly not going to happen. The leadership will not permit Members to vote their conscience. There are many Members in this body on the other side of the aisle who know and have said to me that tax cuts do not make sense at this time. Whatever happened to the charade in the Senate during the budget resolution debate? We heard Members on the other side say there is no tax cut in the budget resolution; what are you talking about? Some Members tried to point out there was a $170 billion item that said if certain things happened, we would have $170 billion available that could be used for a tax cut. On the television and on the Senate floor the fraud was perpetrated that that $170 billion was not specifically devoted to tax cuts. Some of the Members on the other side were more straightforward, including the Chair. He did not mess around. He put out an amendment that said if there is $170 billion, it shall be used for a tax cut. That at least was honest. He was not pretending. The Chair does believe in the tax cut and was straightforward about it. He had a good day yesterday. Not only did that $170 billion get locked in, he got it up to $245 billion with the help of the Members of the other body. This whole charade that was played out in the national media that the Sen","word.count":2085,"sep11":-6.38202247191011,"years":1995.47752808989,"days":170,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.711361936235958,"Topic 2":0.0994078279367986,"Topic 3":0.0202083457408,"Topic 4":0.0417868664024063,"Topic 5":0.0222644291182421,"Topic 6":0.0188638084951062,"Topic 7":0.0170793983423007,"Topic 8":0.0353805290302666,"Topic 9":0.0237940017070618,"Topic 10":0.00985285699106059},{"id":"11020070075067","body":"Frank Lautenberg: Mr. President, once we were able to see beyond the death, destruction, and suffering that Hurricane Katrina wrought, we saw that America is unprepared for a megacatastrophe. We learned that lesson at the expense of those in the gulf states. Nevertheless, our vulnerability is not limited to Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, or to our Southern Atlantic States. Fifty-seven percent of Americans live in areas prone to earthquakes, hurricanes, or other massive disasters. We know about the quakes that have rocked California, Oregon, and Alaska. But the largest earthquake to strike the continental U.S. was centered in New Madrid, MO, in 1811. It rattled a swath of land that spanned from Mississippi to Michigan, from Pennsylvania to Nebraska. Twenty States, including Hawaii, and States that share a shoreline with the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico, face the threat of hurricanes or severe storms every year. New Jersey experienced the second most severe storm in its history just last month. These downpours forced nearly 5,000 New Jerseyans to evacuate their homes and led to the deaths of at least three. Increasing numbers of people make those areas of vulnerability their homes every day. Eight out of the eleven most costly U.S. natural catastrophes have occurred since 2001. The failures of Katrina--from neglected levies to negligent leadership--must be acknowledged and addressed now, before the next catastrophe strikes. We have a moral obligation to learn from that experience. America needs an integrated program that unifies State and Federal policies to prepare and protect American families from the devastation of natural catastrophes. There are steps we can and must take--and we must take them today. We must prevent unnecessary loss of life and property by encouraging State and local governments to enact sensible building codes and land use policies that recognize the exposure to natural catastrophes. We must support first responders with the equipment, training, and personnel needed to save lives and reduce property damage. We must educate consumers and provide them the tools they need to prepare for catastrophes and protect their families and homes from harm. We must establish a rigorous process of continuous improvement by learning from past mistakes and assessing recovery efforts after every disaster to identify ways to continually improve our ability to recover from catastrophes. My Senate colleagues, the warnings before Hurricane Katrina were shamefully ignored and unheeded, the response was slow and erratic, and this Nation paid an enormous price. We have been warned. We must learn from the lessons of Katrina and exhibit the leadership America needs to be prepared and protected from catastrophes to come.","word.count":430,"sep11":5.80056179775281,"years":2007.66011235955,"days":4507,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.004168274815005,"Topic 2":0.301067653145622,"Topic 3":0.081058697454359,"Topic 4":0.00143532273635027,"Topic 5":0.207788064559088,"Topic 6":0.345543292344384,"Topic 7":0.0119364802577813,"Topic 8":0.00363194928577759,"Topic 9":0.0417335659402741,"Topic 10":0.00163669946135867},{"id":"10619990086693","body":"Bob Graham: Mr. President, last night, surprisingly, our session adjourned early. This morning, even more surprisingly, we had no session at all. I am sad to say I am suspicious enough to think that the reason for the early adjournment yesterday and the absence of a session this morning was in order to reduce the opportunity for those such as myself who believe the issue we are debating is extremely fundamental, albeit also extremely sensitive to some, and therefore deserves a full discussion. By the shortening of the session yesterday and this morning's termination of the session, we lost several hours that would have otherwise been used to discuss this issue with our colleagues and with the American people. But there were some benefits of the fact that we were not in session last evening and we were not in session this morning. And that is that some of us--I hope many of us-- had an opportunity to see a repeat of a lecture that was given in 1995 by the eminent American historian, David McCullough. The lecture was given at the LBJ school at the University of Texas in Austin, TX. It was on a general topic of ``Character Above All''--``Character Above All.'' The topic of David McCullough's lecture was Harry Truman, a man who served in this Chamber with great distinction, presided over this Chamber briefly as Vice President of the United States, and then for the better part of 8 years served as President of the United States. In his lecture, Mr. McCullough outlined a number of the characteristics of Harry Truman that made him such a distinguished figure. Mr. McCullough said that he was a better American than he was a President; that he was the embodiment of the essential value of his country--a man who had been raised in rural circumstances in Missouri, was not particularly well educated but, in fact, by his own efforts became classically educated, and then rose to the highest position in the land at a time of extreme national urgency during those critical years immediately after World War II. Mr. McCullough said one of the characteristics of Harry Truman that made him such an effective American, an effective President, and revered citizen of this land was the fact that he had a set of core values. He knew who he was; he knew what he stood for; he did not have to wake up in the morning and put his finger in the air to find out which direction the wind was blowing. I suggest that this debate today is essentially about character-- individual character, yes, but more importantly the character of our Nation, the character of our democracy at the end of the 20th century. This debate is also about fundamental values. In what do we believe? What do we consider to be worthy of asking our fellow citizens and ourselves to sacrifice for? Mr. McCullough talked about the fact that some Presidents who do not rise to the highest ranks of history's estimation were Presidents who were reluctant to ask the American people to do great things; that the Presidents who have challenged us to our fullest potential as a people have been those Presidents whom we mark as being our most revered. I believe those comments about character, about values, about who we are as Americans, are significant in this debate this evening because we are talking about an issue that goes to the heart of our society, to the heart of the relationship between our society of America and the formal institution of government, which is the embodiment of our society. I regret to say that today the abuses, the pernicious effects of money in our political system, represent a cancer, a cancer that is eating away at the heart of our values, the heart of our compact as Americans, the heart of our democracy. There are symptoms of this cancer. They include the increased feeling of disaffection between citizens and their government, a feeling that government is not a part of the ``we'' of which we all belong, but it is the ``they'' who are in confrontation with our own personal desire; and the low level of participation--not only the low level of participation in the act of voting, but also the low level of participation in people's willingness to serve in civic activities. There was a long essay recently by a Harvard professor called ``Bowling Alone,'' about the fact that some of the institutions such as civic clubs and even sports organizations that have previously been a source of our national coherence have been increasingly shredded--low participation in people's willingness to accept positions of appointed responsibility, whether it is to the local PTA or to a governmental position, low participation of people in basic citizens' responsibilities such as jury duty, the very difficulty of our voluntary military to get an adequate number of persons to fill the ranks of our Army, Navy, and Air Force. I was struck over the weekend, which, frankly, was spent in part watching some football games, at how many ads were run by our services to try to entice people to join the military. Those ads are themselves an indication of the difficulty of securing the kind of citizen participation associated with our democracy--the difficulty of attracting people to run for public office. Unfortunately, many people today are running away from public office. I have had some considerable personal experience trying to encourage people who I thought had talent and integrity and would bring the experience of their lives to enhance public decisionmaking. How difficult it is to get those people to be willing to expose themselves to the kind of requirements of which the necessity to raise enormous amounts of money in a way that many people believe is degrading and requires them to pander makes seeking public office unattractive and in the final analysis is an option which is rejected. Another example of the symptoms of this disease of cancer eating away at the heart of our democracy is the fact that now leading business executives are declaring that they are going to opt out of this current fundraising system, that they no longer want to pick up the phone, as one of those executives said while interviewed on television, 1,000 times for people soliciting funds, and not just soliciting what might be considered a reasonable contribution but soliciting for thousands of dollars of contributions over and over and over. And so they have opted out of the system. Our efforts today are a part of a larger effort to try to restore those values of community, those values of common sharing of the excitement, the responsibilities, and the obligations of a democratic society. I hope that our efforts this week will be the beginning of true reform--reform that puts our political system back in the hands of the people. The current version of Senator McCain's and Senator Feingold's legislation focuses on soft money. That is the money which comes into a political party that is not subject to the normal regulations and is unlimited in amount; with only minor manipulation soft money now can be used for almost any political purpose. Other than soft money which we typically refer to as hard money, the money that is regulated, the money that is limited in amount, the money that is subject to full reporting, there is virtually no difference in what today's soft money can be used for and what hard money can be used for. We will have other amendments to consider in other areas of needed reform in our campaign finance system. All of these are important and worthy of debate. I hope we will keep our focus on what I suggest is the single most important issue we face: How can we eliminate from our system the amount that is coming from the enormous faucet of soft money? How can we begin to restore the American public's trust and confidence in their government? The public should be confident their elected representatives are voting on the basis of honestly held convictions, not on the basis of who has contributed tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars to a political party, which money then is used to advance that particular public official's political candidacy. While we cannot legislate the trust of the American people, we can plant the seeds of confidence by enacting real campaign finance reform. We must change the path we are on to regain the public's trust. It is critical the American people have trust in their public institutions to assure the proper functioning of a democracy. In 1774, Edmund Burke was a member of the British Parliament. He had cast a vote which was contrary to the will of his constituency in the community of Bristol. They berated him for not having voted the way they--those who had elected him to the Parliament--would have preferred. Edmund Burke accepted the responsibility as a representative of the people to also become an educator of the people. He said to the electors of Bristol on November 3 of 1774, your representative owes you not his industry only but his judgment; and he betrays instead of serving you if he sacrifices it to your opinion. The people of Bristol may have temporarily been disappointed that Edmund Burke did not do what they felt at the moment was their desire, but they were satisfied with the fact he was giving them more than just a weather vane of their opinion; rather, he was giving them the benefit of his informed judgment. Today, unfortunately, many citizens believe their representatives follow neither their judgment nor popular opinion. Instead, they believe it is only the donors of huge amounts of soft money who hold the ear and the vote of their elected representatives. We are not the first branch of government to recognize the connection between our actions and our appearances and the public's confidence and willingness to respect and legitimize our actions. For many years, the Judiciary has imposed upon itself strict rules governing the conduct of judges and lawyers. These rules do not exist because it is assumed judges will engage in unethical behavior; rather, it is to make certa","word.count":3788,"sep11":-1.94662921348315,"years":1999.91292134831,"days":1749,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.168106764916851,"Topic 2":0.0265547765958279,"Topic 3":0.0173423228058843,"Topic 4":0.338664605533208,"Topic 5":0.00687683449891112,"Topic 6":0.382204571220192,"Topic 7":0.00436842900030768,"Topic 8":0.04069272232483,"Topic 9":0.00359976321785877,"Topic 10":0.0115892098861285},{"id":"10820040032966","body":"James McGovern: I want to thank my good friend, Mr. Wolf, for sponsoring this resolution and for his leadership in the fight to end hunger here in the United States and around the world. I also want to thank Chairman Goodlatte, Ranking Member Stenholm, and the members of the Agriculture Committee for moving this resolution forward for consideration by the full House. I rise in support of H. Res. 261. America's Second harvest, the food banks that operate across the country, and the volunteers who help provide assistance at these organizations deserve to be recognized and thanked for their diligence and hard work in combating hunger in America. Mr. Speaker, I believe hunger is a political problem. There is no reason people--both here at home and around the world--should go without food. America is known as a country of plenty, and it is shameful that our prosperous nation still has children, veterans, seniors, and other individuals and families who simply do not know from day to day whether they will have enough to eat. The system of food banks throughout the United States provides a safety net where individuals and families can go to get a meal when they really need one. In my own congressional district and hometown of Worcester, Massachusetts, the Worcester County Food Bank provides this invaluable service to the people of Central Massachusetts. Jean McMurray, the executive director of the Food Bank, helps provide food for soup kitchens and food pantries throughout Worcester County. The food bank also runs and operates a kitchen where they prepare food for soup kitchens and train people in food service and food preparation skills in order to find good-paying jobs. These are excellent programs and an excellent food bank, and I am so very pleasing that this resolution recognizes and honors the work of Jean McMurray, her staff and their counterparts across the country. Mr. Speaker, our food banks are stretched thin. Every day they are called upon to provide more and more assistance. Sadly, more people go without food every day in our country, and the safety net provided by these food banks, the assistance that help the food insecure escape starvation, is strained to the breaking point. As Co-Chair of the Congressional Hunger Center, I have worked closely with America's Second Harvest and local food banks. The Congressional Hunger Center, dedicated to training tomorrow's leaders in the fight against hunger, places Emerson Trust Fellows in food banks and other anti-hunger organizations across the country so that they may see and learn first-hand from the work carried out by these groups. Mr. Speaker, like my colleague Mr. Wolf, I am committed to ending hunger in America. We have a blueprint researched and developed by the Alliance to End Hunger on how Congress and the American people, working together, can achieve that goal. This resolution honors many of the groups and individuals who are on the front lines of that battle, and I thank Congressman Wolf once again for his leadership. I hope passage of this resolution will help energize this body to make a full commitment to ending hunger in America once and for all.","word.count":524,"sep11":3.14606741573034,"years":2005.00561797753,"days":3562,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.621295275029767,"Topic 2":0.0862656902491917,"Topic 3":0.0205567176691107,"Topic 4":0.0346333425874296,"Topic 5":0.0131552969842913,"Topic 6":0.0205637706754323,"Topic 7":0.0908798720989077,"Topic 8":0.0355827451408038,"Topic 9":0.0696307465756024,"Topic 10":0.00743654298946328},{"id":"11020070024631","body":"Speaker: Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. As a Member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of H.R. 5506 which names the postal facility in Jersey City, New Jersey, after Bishop Ralph E. Brower. H.R. 5506, which was introduced by Representative Albio Sires of New Jersey on February 27, 2008, was reported from the Oversight Committee on June 12, 2008, by voice vote. This measure has the support of the entire New Jersey delegation and provides this body a chance to recognize the contributions and accomplishments of a distinguished and highly respected gentleman from the Garden State of New Jersey, the admirable Bishop Ralph E. Brower. Unfortunately, Representative Sires is unable to join us on the floor today, but nonetheless, he asked that his statement of support be submitted for the Record. Born into humble beginnings in North Carolina as the eldest of six children, Bishop Brower's educational aspirations led him to attend Laurinburg Institute and Kettle College of North Carolina. He received his master's degree from Kings College in Briarcliff Manor, New York, his master's in divinity from Florida State University, and his Ph.D. from Grambling State University. Bishop Brower began to make his mark on New Jersey and the community of Jersey City in the early 1950s when he took the helm of St. Michael's Methodist Church. Over the years, he has overseen the growth of the congregation from six members to the thousands that now worship at St. Michael's. Largely responsible for helping the church and its congregation blossom into a positive force for change in the community, Bishop Ralph E. Brower undoubtedly deserves the honor of having a United States postal facility named after him. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in support of this measure by voting in favor of H.R. 5506. I reserve the balance of my time.","word.count":125,"sep11":5.88202247191011,"years":2007.74157303371,"days":4536,"party":"Other","chamber":"","Topic 1":0.149580769565832,"Topic 2":0.5631023350536,"Topic 3":0.0335869256280956,"Topic 4":0.0155006349814049,"Topic 5":0.00527790782285268,"Topic 6":0.194139888003601,"Topic 7":0.00291280506951122,"Topic 8":0.00565597919220085,"Topic 9":0.0247314029298301,"Topic 10":0.00551135175307084},{"id":"10820040051745","body":"Jeff Sessions: Mr. President, I express my appreciation to Senator Alexander of Tennessee for his wise remarks. Listening to the Senator, it reminded me of that advertisement: When E.F. Hutton speaks, you should listen. When Senator Alexander talks on education, we ought to listen, and, indeed, when he speaks on a lot of subjects. He has served as Secretary of Education for the United States. He has been the president of the University of Tennessee. He has also been the Governor of Tennessee who had to run their school systems. He brings tremendous wisdom and experience and insight to this issue. It must be our goal to improve the quality of education for children in America today. We have to work on that issue. We are not where we ought to be. There is too much inequality today. I also think about Brown v. Board of Education, as we celebrate that historic decision today, and that Senator Alexander clerked for Judge John Minor Wisdom, one of the judges who is famous in the old Fifth Circuit for enforcing Brown v. Board of Education. Brown v. Board of Education had more impact than most decisions have ever had from the Supreme Court. As a young student in school, I rode a bus every day 15 miles to school. As we went north on the road to my school, we would pass a bus with African American children heading south. So the white kids went to the school up in the northern end of town, and we would pass one another. I went further than I should have traveled to get to school, and they went further than they should have traveled to get to their school. In addition, the schools of the African-American community were not as good, and their schoolbuses were not as good, for the most part, either. It was not an equal system. The Supreme Court of the United States considered the issue in 1954, and they evaluated what was happening. They said the laws of the United States should treat people equally, and that it is not equal treatment to say to a person: You cannot go to this school, although you may live quite close to it, simply because of the color of your skin. We had grown up with that situation. People did not give it much thought. They accepted it as the way things were. The Supreme Court ruled differently, and people complained about it. Some even said it was activism and the Supreme Court was overreaching. But if you read the Constitution and the law, it seems to me the Supreme Court at that point was not an activist court, it was not an overreaching court; it was a court founded on law, and they went back and read the plain language of the Constitution, and they said this process of denying one person the right to attend a school simply because of the color of their skin violated our Constitution. I think that was a plain ruling, a fair ruling, and a good ruling. I know we are about to take up the defense bill in a few minutes, but I would say this: Things have changed in many different ways. My two daughters grew up in Mobile, AL, not too far from Murphy High School. Murphy is one of the oldest, largest schools in Mobile. The Mobile County school system is a very large system. I believe they have 60,000 students. It is a great historic school. Fifty years ago, it was an all-white school. There were all-African-American schools in the community. They have, as a result of Brown, integrated the school system. My daughters went to that school, and the racial mix was almost exactly 50-50. They enjoyed their time at Murphy High School. It is an excellent high school. In fact, I remember Secretary Bill Bennett, when he was Secretary of Education, came down and gave them a blue-ribbon, topflight national school award for the excellence in education there. They loved that school. They had friends who were White, friends who were African American, friends who were Asian, and friends who were from India. They were all in that school system. They benefited from that experience and did well as a result of it. I believe the decision was beneficial legally. I believe the decision was beneficial for the children. It made a statement, with crystal clarity, that people could not be denied the right to public activities simply because of the color of their skin. That is an important principle in this country. We were very slow to recognize it. The South was openly segregated in so many different ways, and this decision broke it down. It took many years before the decision would be fully implemented, but it has been implemented, and much good has come from it. President Bush has said in his philosophy of education that we must not let children fall behind. He has used the phrase ``the soft bigotry of low expectations.'' What he means is, if our children are going to a public school that is doing pretty well, and they are doing fine, and minority students are going to a school that is not doing so well, we should not have the attitude, well, we are not too concerned about that. In fact, more dangerous than that is a philosophy that we have low expectations, and we are not going to demand the same quality in all school systems in America. That is not acceptable. Our children can learn. All children of all races can learn. We need to challenge all students to be their very best. We cannot allow children to fall behind. We need to identify children who are falling behind early. If you love children, if you care about the poor, if you care about minority students, and you want them to succeed, you will find out how they are doing. That is why the President said we want to test. The Government plan of No Child Left Behind is not to test to punish or to put down a child; it is to find out how they are doing in school. If they are falling behind, we need to intervene promptly and quickly to lift them up so they can reach their fullest potential. Secretary Rod Paige, our Secretary of Education today, is an experienced educator who was the dean of a school and was the superintendent of the huge school system in Houston, TX--he has said by the time children get to the ninth grade, if they are not up to speed, if they are substantially behind in reading and math and cannot compete, that is when they drop out. So the President's legislation--what we worked on--is designed to find out much earlier if children are falling behind, to give them that intensive support and extra resources necessary to have them catch up so they will no longer be behind, so when they get to the 8th grade, the 9th grade, or the 10th grade, they will be able to function and do high school work and go on and complete their degree and be successful in the world rather than becoming frustrated or becoming a discipline problem, and maybe even dropping out of school because they know they are so far behind they cannot keep up. That is what we focused on when we crafted the No Child Left Behind Act. That is ultimately one of the keys to American movement in this new century; and that is, are our children reaching their highest possible level of achievement. The more children who achieve their highest and greatest potential, the greater the benefit will be for our country. I see my time is up. We are about ready to go to the defense bill. I again express my appreciation to Senator Alexander for his insights and commitment to education. There is much we can do to make our system better. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.","word.count":1343,"sep11":2.75,"years":2004.6095505618,"days":3421,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.282927410775488,"Topic 2":0.351640368136433,"Topic 3":0.0282588752017587,"Topic 4":0.0847435468521415,"Topic 5":0.03862284876784,"Topic 6":0.0368337759060035,"Topic 7":0.00936988795538689,"Topic 8":0.124729053320444,"Topic 9":0.0158257674581991,"Topic 10":0.0270484656263055},{"id":"10920060020138","body":"Frank Wolf: Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume The gentleman stated that this bill was below the Administration's request.

The House has adopted Representative Frost's amendment which establishes a Federal crime for repeat sexual offenses against children. I now ask my colleagues to go further to protect the other vulnerable members of communities who are terrorized by repeat sexual predators. My amendment would allow Federal prosecution for offenders accused of a second rape or other serious sexual assault. If convicted under this Federal prosecution, the sexual predator would be imprisoned for life without parole. This amendment is designed to change our approach to repeat sex offenders. The American people are outraged that our criminal justice system releases these obsessive criminals after just a few years. Some national statistics indicate that rapists are 10 times more likely than other convicts to repeat their crimes. Yet the average convicted rapist serves only about 5 years in jail. Even the repeat sexual offenders themselves recognize the problem. The convicted killer of Polly Klaas has been quoted as saying that he should not have been on the street. Since we cannot change the behavior of these sexual predators, we need to keep them behind bars. The amendment does just that. Repeat rapists would receive life sentences in Federal prison. It seems you open the newspaper every week and read about another monster committing a horrific crime. In the last several years, residents of California, Florida, Massachusetts, Indiana, Texas, Virginia, Washington, Vermont, Oregon, Idaho, New York, and Maryland have experienced the terror of serial rapists and molesters. Too often these fiends have long histories of preying on women and children, but they have been released to attack again and again. For example, in California Leo Anthony Goodloe began his grisly career by raping and severely beating a 17-year-old woman in 1956. Over the next 39 years, he served 16 years in prison for 10 felonies, but was released to rape again and again. Even with such a record, he served less than 2 years for a rape and sodomy conviction in 1990. Four months after his release, he raped and beat yet another victim. While he has finally been sentenced to 43 years in prison without the possibility of parole, his reign of terror continued far too long. Similarly, in 1994, police in New York City arrested Robert Daniels for four rapes. Daniels had been paroled 10 months earlier after serving less than 10 years for his second rape conviction. Besides his first rape conviction in 1969, he had also been convicted of sex offenses in 1974 and 1976. This sickening litany is all too common. In my hometown of Rochester, we know all too well the horror of serial rapists. Arthur Shawcross had served less than 15 years for the sexually motivated murders of two children. A model prisoner, Shawcross was released and his parole officer lost track of him. Before he was caught again, Shawcross had raped and killed 10 women. In the last Congress we instituted a Federal data base of sexual offenders, first proposed in the protection from sexual predators bill I introduced in 1994. That was an important first step in giving police departments the resources needed to catch repeat sexual predators, like Shawcross. Today we have taken another step by providing a means to protect our communities from the monsters that sexually attack children. But as legislators, our job is not yet complete. When I speak with my constituents they are especially worried about the threat posed by violent, repeat offenders--and particularly by the sexual predators who seem to be released from prison over and over, only to commit the same sickening crimes once more. These monsters prey on the most private aspect of our lives. They often invade the sanctity of our homes as well as our streets, and unfortunately, no community is safe from this threat. It is time to stop fooling ourselves and to lock up these repeat offenders for good. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It will give prosecutors across the Nation the ability to ensure that our communities are safeguarded from these revolving door rapists. It will tell the victims of these sexual fiends that we do not find this behavior a minor aberration; that we understand that the lives of the victims of rape are forever changed, and that we, as a society will not stand by and let the same person wreak this havoc and destroy life after life after life. In the name of past and future victims of these unspeakable rapists, I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.","word.count":347,"sep11":-6.69943820224719,"years":1995.16011235955,"days":57,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0720451227584656,"Topic 2":0.162413834555386,"Topic 3":0.0440752368411355,"Topic 4":0.00268661414781487,"Topic 5":0.180437925214017,"Topic 6":0.0238824869208191,"Topic 7":0.0295504802027806,"Topic 8":0.168494034520923,"Topic 9":0.0821911760570296,"Topic 10":0.234223088781628},{"id":"10820030054180","body":"John Breaux: Mr. President, this morning the Senate has convened again to allow Members to pay tribute to the life of Ronald Wilson Reagan, our 40th President.

This bill provides funding for both improved education in the information technology fields and grants to partner colleges with companies to train today's students to be tomorrow's leaders.

Mr. Speaker, this bill will create information technology research centers where multi-discipline research can be combined for the greatest results. It will allow the National Science Foundation to produce new state- of-the-art computer systems through a competitive bidding process that will help fight disease, track and predict weather and allow grant recipients access to the computer hardware they need to carry out their research at a new level of excellence. In the 20th century, Federal research money brought us the Internet, which has revolutionized computing and information technology for all of us. H.R. 2086 will help make the United States the leader for the next generation and the next century in the information revolution and will continue to lead the world in information technology far into the next century. Mr. Speaker, I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting the rule and the bill.","word.count":630,"sep11":-2.65168539325843,"years":1999.20786516854,"days":1498,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.00626552196168298,"Topic 2":0.437463559564394,"Topic 3":0.071717320322452,"Topic 4":0.00385120482163561,"Topic 5":0.377202905939813,"Topic 6":0.00293414297156347,"Topic 7":0.0385216296245444,"Topic 8":0.0216323740476231,"Topic 9":0.00689220507997804,"Topic 10":0.0335191356663135},{"id":"10720010003240","body":"Donald Manzullo: Pursuant to House Resolution 367, the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania and a Member opposed each will control 10 minutes.

What we are suggesting is that the Federal Government ought to make an effort, because the children who are doing the poorest most likely are in the poorest condition schools. We ought to try to target some effort so that those local communities could fix up those schools and make them appropriate for the education of our young children.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer support for this resolution, House Concurrent Resolution 292. I recognize my good friend and colleague, the gentleman from New Jersey who has been in many ways my tutor in matters of great importance to my heart, and particularly in this difficult area of the Horn of Africa. What can we do in this resolution, Mr. Speaker? We can do very little. I recognize that. But at the most basic level we can say that we notice and we care that things that happen in what would be considered by most Americans a remote part of the world, the Horn of Africa, does touch all of us in the United States as lovers of freedom. We have nothing but praise for the way the people of Eritrea and Ethiopia fought for their freedom from a tyranny of many years, from artifacts of the Cold War, and, eventually, in the case of Eritrea itself, in receiving independence from Ethiopia. And at the time there was such optimism because this was a peaceful transition, which is regrettably rare in the world and regrettably rare in Africa. The first thing we can do is say we observe, we know what is happening, and we do care. Second, this resolution which I drafted with the help of my colleague, the gentleman from New Jersey , and I wish to say the help as well of the administration, does not choose sides. This resolution does not say that we have decided which side is right. And it is important that we do not enter into that judgment. Nevertheless, I do wish to call attention to the fact that the Assistant Secretary of State, Susan Rice, has been a substantial player in bringing about what cease-fire exists right now; that she deserves a great degree of credit; that I here give her that credit on the floor. I know I will be joined by my colleagues in so doing. And that in the achievement of a cease-fire, we have at least some progress. Mr. Speaker, the next step is for the people of Eritrea and Ethiopia, of course. But it seems to me, and I believe many members of our committee, that the delineation of the border between Eritrea and Ethiopia should be given to an international organization, whether it is the Organization of African Unity or the United Nations Secretariat or the World Court. That even while there is no actual settlement of the conflict, the beginning of the delineation between the two countries can proceed--from which, both countries say, all of the conflict follows. So the second main point I would say is whereas we are observing and we do care about this, we are not choosing sides, but the delineation of the border ought to proceed while the bullets are not flying. And then whoever is determined to own what property at the end of that delineation will be the result of a neutral, a third-party process. Lastly, Mr. Speaker, a personal note. I have traveled to Africa with the gentleman from New Jersey , my good friend and colleague, my tutor, as I call him, and have made Africa my focus. And it is of great personal sadness to me that this war broke out. I address these words more to my friends in Eritrea and Ethiopia than to our colleagues here today, Mr. Speaker, when I say it is difficult to draw the attention of the United States to the tremendous amount of good that we can do with a small investment of caring, a small investment of our resources in this part of the world, and whatever success the gentleman from New Jersey has had for the years that he has been here doing this before I came back to Congress and began to work with him, whatever success we have had, is cast into jeopardy. Cast into jeopardy by the illustration of war between these two countries-- because the easiest thing is to say no. The easiest thing is to find a reason not to be concerned, to turn one's back, to vote for foreign aid to countries that will help one politically instead of for a little bit of assistance that can save some lives or make a child see who would otherwise go blind, and vindicate the trust that the people of Eritrea and Ethiopia have given to their democratic leadership. So, I conclude by making that observation. Mr. Speaker, to those watching in the governments of Eritrea and Ethiopia, know the harm that this war has done to those of us in this country who would seek to help the progress of people who have done so much on their own to the commendation of all of those who have observed it. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York for allowing me to present the argument in favor of H. Con. Res. 292 and for his courtesy to me on the committee on this and everything else.","word.count":167,"sep11":-4.06741573033708,"years":1997.79213483146,"days":994,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.455316416308959,"Topic 2":0.203046114088644,"Topic 3":0.038465914563313,"Topic 4":0.0718676413561735,"Topic 5":0.0187948235476295,"Topic 6":0.0163803216917941,"Topic 7":0.0765344202239078,"Topic 8":0.0543030688004076,"Topic 9":0.0567541654362642,"Topic 10":0.00853711398290669},{"id":"11020070078135","body":"Christopher J. Dodd: Mr. President, last week the Senate and House of Representatives voted to adopt a budget resolution for the upcoming fiscal year. I was proud to support this budget, which, in my view, represents an important first step towards returning our nation to a healthy and strong fiscal and economic course. Like the budget of any family or business, the federal budget provides a framework for responsibly meeting our nation's most important priorities while ensuring that we are living within our means. This year's budget restores much-needed fiscal discipline while better targeting our resources towards the investments that will best promote economic growth, national security, and broad-based opportunity. First, the budget resolution reinstates pay-as-you-go rules, which require that any new spending or tax cuts be paid for with spending cuts or new sources of revenue--rather than simply adding the cost to the national debt for our children and grandchildren to repay with interest. These rules played a major role in helping us to achieve Federal budget surpluses in the late 1990s. The resolution also puts a stop to procedural abuses that had been used by the previous leadership in the Congress, notably the use of budget reconciliation protections-- designed for legislation that reduces the deficit--to ram through passage of budget-busting tax bills. These procedural improvements, combined with reasonable and responsible spending limits and revenue targets, provide for much-improved--and much-needed fiscal discipline on both the spending and revenue sides of the ledger. In the 1990s, we saw how responsible budget policies and economic growth reinforced each other in a cycle that lifted Americans' standard of living across the board. Under the current administration, by contrast, Americans have seen the opposite effect, as irresponsible and poorly targeted fiscal policies have squandered the previous decade's fiscal gains while economic growth has accrued more and more narrowly to a smaller segment of the population. The Federal budget has declined from a surplus of $236 billion in 2000 to a deficit of $248 billion last year, while the national debt has grown from $5.6 trillion to $8.8 trillion. Over the same period, real median household income in our country has fallen by nearly $1,300. Within the context of fiscal responsibility, the budget adopted last week puts in place a framework for restoring the investments necessary for broad-based economic growth and a return to budget surpluses. Rather than leaving middle-class families behind, it focuses on strengthening the middle class--the backbone of our economy. This begins with promoting an agenda of innovation and entrepreneurship. The President's budget this year--for the second consecutive year--proposed the largest cut to education in the history of the Department of Education, along with cuts to research and development and technology transfer. It would be hard to find a worse idea than to cut the investments that allow our children to fulfill their maximum potential and drive our nation's economic growth now and in the future. This budget rejects the president's cuts, providing an additional $6.3 billion for education from preschool to graduate school. As I have said numerous times before, we can be confident that the investment we make here will be returned to us many times over. This year's budget also directs more resources towards improving heath care quality and coverage, and reducing cost--an issue that affects every American family and businesses' bottom line. The resolution includes a deficit-neutral reserve fund to help cover uninsured children and funds for health information technology and comparative effectiveness to help reduce skyrocketing costs. Just as importantly, with our military being stretched to its limits, the budget includes full funding for restoring force readiness and adequately equipping our military personnel serving in harm's way. It also includes $3.6 billion above the Bush administration's budget to address the needs of veterans when they return home, because the brave Americans who have served our country deserve much better than the conditions that were revealed in the recent Walter Reed Army Medical Center scandal. The priorities laid out in the budget adopted last week contrast sharply with the agendas of recent years. Where the Bush administration and previous leadership in the Congress sacrificed all else at the altar of high-income tax cuts, this year's budget will keep taxes low while restoring the importance of education, health care, clean and renewable energy, and the needs of our military. This change is a welcome development that puts our Nation on a better, stronger, more prosperous, and more secure course for the future.","word.count":741,"sep11":5.84550561797753,"years":2007.70505617978,"days":4523,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.315475507463777,"Topic 2":0.214751875275464,"Topic 3":0.0543361581163982,"Topic 4":0.155601851311255,"Topic 5":0.120725668221948,"Topic 6":0.00974550003032494,"Topic 7":0.00641126577872081,"Topic 8":0.0215870477253358,"Topic 9":0.0235947813956108,"Topic 10":0.0777703446811658},{"id":"10419960080049","body":"Carl Levin: It is in line with the question of the Senator from Utah Is it not true that when the Justice Department was asked for that prosecution memo by the House, it did everything in its power not to give that prosecution memo to the House, and, as a matter of fact, it was only after the House subpoenaed that prosecution memo that it was then delivered to the House?

Ferguson Post Office Building''. Mr. Ferguson was a distinguished public servant who began his postal career at the Harvey, Illinois Post Office, where he worked as a city carrier from 1954 to 1957. He then moved to the Flora, Illinois Post Office where he worked his way up from clerk/carrier to Assistant Postmaster to Postmaster in 1986. During the final three years of his career before he retired in 1988, Robert Ferguson served as Postmaster in Collinsville, Illinois. In recognition of his hard work and dedication, Mr. Ferguson received five Outstanding Superior Accomplishment Awards and qualified as a Postmaster Trainer on October 1, 1976. He worked tirelessly on behalf of postal workers and traveled throughout Southern Illinois training newly appointed Postmasters. He was well liked by his colleagues who knew they had a leader they could trust. In addition to his active professional life, Robert Ferguson found time to serve his community. As President of the Clay County Shrine Club in 1992, he organized events to raise thousands of dollars for the Shriner's Hospital for Children. In 1996, he raised money to assist a local family after a storm destroyed their mobile home. In 2002, Mr. Ferguson created a Hospital Directory for Southern Illinois, which aid local citizens by providing phone numbers and addresses of local hospitals. In 1996, the Flora Chamber of Commerce named Robert Ferguson the ``Outstanding Citizen of Flora''. Mr. President, post offices are often designated in honor of individuals who have made valuable contributions to their community, State, and country. I can think of no more fitting way to permanently and publicly recognize Robert Ferguson's work than to name the Flora, Illinois post office in his honor.

Mr. Speaker, this is a time when seniors seem to be taking the brunt of the cuts in health care costs, specifically in areas such as home health care and venipuncture. So I am honored to support legislation that would make prescription drugs affordable for our seniors. Today our parents and our grandparents are being forced to pay much steeper prices for prescription drugs than the so-called most favored customers of drug companies, such as HMOs, large hospital chains, and indeed the Federal Government. This is wrong. These entities are able to buy drugs at discounted prices, and drug companies subsequently raise their prices to seniors and others who pay for needed prescriptions for themselves. A Federal study that was initiated by the gentleman from Texas , who was the originator of this bill, and we congratulate him, asserts that our senior citizens are paying twice what the most favored customers are paying. This bill provides the solution to the problem by creating a level playing field. It allows retail pharmacies to buy medications used by senior citizens directly from the General Services Administration of the Federal Government. Because the GSA is one of the entities that is able to purchase these prescription medications at much lower prices, this procedure will allow pharmacists to pass on significant cost savings to our senior citizens. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this concept, and I congratulate the gentleman from Texas for his foresight in working on this issue, and all of the other cosponsors who have joined, such as the gentlewoman from California , to make sure that we lift this issue up to our Nation's consciousness and that as soon as possible we try to provide some relief for our seniors in the purchase of their much-needed prescription drugs.

We should not allow the heinous killing of a partially delivered baby to be lawful any longer. In a partial-birth abortion, the abortionist pulls a living baby feet-first out of the womb and into the birth canal, except for the head, which the abortionist purposely keeps lodged just inside the cervix. The abortionist then punctures the base of the skull with a surgical instrument, such as a long surgical scissors or a pointed hollow metal tube called a trochar. He or she then inserts a catheter into the wound and removes the baby's brain with a powerful suction machine. This causes the skull to collapse, after which the abortionist completes the delivery of the now-dead baby. H.R. 4965 would ban performance of this abhorrent procedure except if it were necessary to save a mother's life. It defines partial-birth abortion as an abortion in which ``the person performing the abortion deliberately and intentionally vaginally delivers a living fetus until, in the case of a head-first presentation, the entire fetal head is outside of the body of the mother, or, in the case of breech presentation, any part of the fetal trunk past the naval is outside the body of the mother,'' and then kills the baby. The bill would permit use of the procedure if ``necessary to save the life of a mother whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, physical illness, or physical injury, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself.'' According to Ron Fitzsimmons, executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers, partial-birth abortions are performed 3,000 to 5,000 times annually, usually in the fifth and sixth months of pregnancy, on healthy babies of healthy mothers. It has also been used to perform abortions as late as in the third trimester, which is the seventh month and later. Many of these babies are old enough to live, and many of them are developed enough to feel the pain of this horrendous procedure. The Congress has voted to ban partial-birth abortions twice, only for the ban to be vetoed both times.

That day, President Roosevelt said that the bill ``Gives emphatic notice to the men and women in our Armed Forces that the American people do not intend to let them down.'' Since 1944, nearly 8 million veterans have benefitted from the GI bill. Nearly 8 million men and women, home from war, provided with the opportunity to advance their education, get better jobs, and afford a brighter future for themselves and their families. Among them, seven now serve in the United States Senate: Dan Akaka graduated from the University of Hawaii, Chuck Hagel graduated from the University of Nebraska at Omaha, Dan Inouye graduated from the University of Hawaii and George Washington Law School, Frank Lautenberg graduated from Columbia University, Ted Stevens graduated from UCLA and Harvard Law School, John Warner graduated from Washington and Lee and the University of Virginia Law School, and Jim Webb, a Naval Academy alumnus, graduated from Georgetown Law School. There is no doubt that if you ask any of these seven distinguished Americans, they would tell you that along with hard work, the GI bill was a major reason for their success. The 8 million veterans on the GI bill became an army of prosperity here at home. They became doctors, teachers, scientists, architects, and, like the seven I mentioned, public servants. They saved lives, built cities, enriched young minds and expanded the opportunities available to a new generation of Americans. Every dollar invested in the GI bill by the Government returns $7 to our economy--and the returns on our cultural prosperity are impossible to calculate. In his time, President Roosevelt promised to never let our troops down. Now it is our time to do the same. The new GI bill, sponsored by Senator Webb and cosponsored by nearly 60 Senators, Democrats and Republicans alike, does just that. It increases educational benefits to all members of the military who have served on active duty since September 11, including reservists and National Guard and it covers college expenses to match the full cost of an in-state public school, plus books and a monthly stipend for housing. This is a bipartisan accomplishment we can all be proud to support. A small minority of voices in the Bush administration oppose it on the faulty logic that it would decrease retention rates. On the contrary, there is every reason to believe that it would increase recruitment rates. I urge all of my colleagues to support this crucial bipartisan bill-- supported by those among us who have served and understand the military best. Democrats are committed to honoring our troops in deeds and not just words. This call should be a cause for all of us. Passing this new GI bill will send that message loud and clear. Once this GI bill reaches the President's desk, I urge him to do the right thing for our troops and veterans by quickly signing it into law.","word.count":519,"sep11":6.86797752808989,"years":2008.72752808989,"days":4887,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.866411329280597,"Topic 2":0.0461731341632768,"Topic 3":0.00916278560721278,"Topic 4":0.0216494668698863,"Topic 5":0.00955607349592349,"Topic 6":0.00951044011418037,"Topic 7":0.00756307150584545,"Topic 8":0.0159870387844517,"Topic 9":0.00991784972722046,"Topic 10":0.00406881045140511},{"id":"10419960025207","body":"Toby Roth: Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding me this time Like so many of my colleagues, Bill Emerson was a personal friend of mine. So many nice things have been said about him on the floor today and rightly so, he deserves all of them. I do have many pleasant memories of Bill Emerson like my colleagues do. I remember the last time we were over with Bob Dole over at the Cannon Caucus Room. So many remember Bob Dole took a few minutes to talk about Bill Emerson in his last speech in the Congress, and I thought that was a wonderful tribute that Bob Dole did. I noticed every speaker spoke about Bill Emerson's attitude, and that is the thing that struck me. I do not think I would have had nearly the courage that Bill Emerson had. I remember the last time I saw him here. I shook hands with him, and I said: ``You have a strong handshake.'' He said: ``I am strong, I just cannot get enough oxygen.'' There was never any doubt that this man just had 100 percent confidence. The gentleman from West Virginia [Mr. Wise] spoke here on the floor. He said that he was in Cape Girardeau, I was at Cape Girardeau with you and some others, and it is true he was really loved and respected. When I first came to Congress here, we had a Congressman by the name of Bill Steiger. He died just before we were sworn in. Tip O'Neill was the Speaker. And Tip O'Neill summed up Bill Steiger's life in four words. He said: ``This man had respect.'' And that is what I would say about Bill Emerson, this man had respect. That is the best I think we can say when a man leaves this Congress, a man or woman leaves this Congress. We also remember when Bill Emerson was in the chair. No one did a better job in the chair than Bill Emerson. Not only was he fair, but he had total command of what was going on on the floor. But Bill Emerson left a legacy to you and to me, and that legacy was courage. I mean real courage. We saw that courage daily here in his wheelchair; his attitude was always 100 percent. I think the thing that we can remember about him, when we think things are tough here on the floor, let us remember Bill Emerson, and things will be made easy.","word.count":416,"sep11":-5.34831460674157,"years":1996.51123595506,"days":538,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.942208054323591,"Topic 2":0.018720537747624,"Topic 3":0.00396760709900234,"Topic 4":0.00820304091254706,"Topic 5":0.00337602386003542,"Topic 6":0.00654406132603498,"Topic 7":0.00356304211256947,"Topic 8":0.00720352555942627,"Topic 9":0.0047995032421655,"Topic 10":0.00141460381700363},{"id":"10419950038439","body":"Anthony C.

To my esteemed colleague, the gentleman from Maryland, I thank him very much for those wonderfully kind words. Dad was incredibly unique for many, many reasons; and he is missed. First, I would like to start off saying that I stand here today in opposition to this bill. It is a difficult time to stand here against a bill that does contain some very good language and make some giant strides in election reform. The drawbacks, though, basically will cancel out the true benefits of this bill. I will start off by giving credit where credit is due, and that is for everyone who worked so hard out of this House to get out a decent bill that took the best parts of what the Senate had to offer to attempt a compromise, bring it in here in some form that would be acceptable to a majority of the Members. I know that took a lot of work, and there has been progress. I thank the Members for their efforts. For the first time in the United States election history, an ID requirement is mandated. I attended hearings in Pennsylvania; missed a couple, I believe, in Illinois; was in Florida and Texas, California, because we had committees, we had commissions, that conducted hearings throughout this Nation. Not once, not once was there ever pointed out that there was a problem that would require a national ID requirement. This came out of the clear blue. The Members that sit in this House tonight will tell us in their conversations, it did not emanate out of this House, not from Members of the House of Representatives. What am I talking about? I will tell the Members what I am talking about: They have made voter registration, and the very act of voting, more difficult. As good as this bill is, it complicates the process, and it will disenfranchise individuals, individuals that live in my community, because all of the Members run for office. We know the registration process, and we know the voting process because we become part of it, and we are in those neighborhoods. What this bill does for mail-in registration: no driver's license, no ballot; no utility bill, no ballot; no government check, no ballot; no bank statement, no ballot; no Social Security number, no ballot. Now, Members may say, we will provide them provisional ballots. Those do not count. Those do not really count. We are talking about what happened in Florida. This gives some sort of a voting right, whatever a provisional ballot really is, because that vote truly is not going to be counted until something is cleared up. On top of it, on top of it now, we are going to have a driver's license or a Social Security or a special four-digit assigned number. That is not just for mail-in ballots, Mr. Speaker, that is anybody, first-time registrants within a State. Even if they cross the county line, they still go through all of this. If they do not have a driver's license, they should give us the last four digits of their Social Security number. If they do not have that, we will assign them a number. But if they do have a driver's license, if they do have a Social Security number and we use the last four digits, we need those verified. We are going to have those verified before we have a database system in place by 2004, because all this goes into effect. States will get waivers, move it to 2006. We will not even have the ability to do this. If any Member has ever been part of a voter registration drive, they know how it is done. There is a deputy that goes up there, because no one can simply go and have something filled out and take it back. They will be asking for the driver's license. They do not have it? Then the Social Security. But for a mail-in ballot, which a majority of the ballots in my community are submitted in this fashion, why? How long has it been since these Members have actually looked at the voter registration card in their counties? It is simple, it is unique, it is efficient. There has never been a problem that would mandate the type of requirement that we will be instituting on a nationwide basis. This will impact communities. It will impact the Latino communities. I end by advising everybody that the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the National Council of La Raza, the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, and the National Puerto Rican Coalition all oppose this legislation.","word.count":797,"sep11":1.10674157303371,"years":2002.96629213483,"days":2836,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.00745415325667812,"Topic 2":0.0377807143129033,"Topic 3":0.0124272343184068,"Topic 4":0.0229418343191532,"Topic 5":0.0250559292763542,"Topic 6":0.00263465933905428,"Topic 7":0.0141628926270425,"Topic 8":0.0107111808525508,"Topic 9":0.852354182003193,"Topic 10":0.0144772196946635},{"id":"10419950091225","body":"Ernest Hollings: Mr. President, right to the point.

Let me just reiterate that this amendment is not applicable to countries on the terrorism list or which are major producers or traffickers in illegal drugs. This provision is specifically intended to enable the U.S. Government to conduct a broad range of rule of law programs, as well as other programs   , so long as there is some component of the program that includes educating or providing information to persons. Mr. President, the United States has been working for a long time to try to find ways to help the most vulnerable populations around the world. Allowing the United States to continue to provide assistance in education and anti corruption training is something which ultimately is in our own interests. In many parts of the world, we are up against elements like the Wahhabis, the Saudis, the Iranians and the likes of Bin Laden and others, who are pouring money into the poorest regions of the world to set up schools which are dedicated to teaching children anti-Western attitudes, as well as how to carry weapons. In many countries, because of the dire poverty, such schools are the only game in town. And the single common element which allows these schools to flourish is poverty and ignorance. There is no other option for many people. The poverty and the lack of education leads to radicalism, and violence, often directed first against women, and a host of problems which every one on this floor can list. The growth of this radicalism comes back and haunts us and affect American lives and American security. The popularity of Bin Laden for example, and the anti-Western fervor which is rampant in the Middle East and South Asia can too often lead to terrorism and attempts to destabilize developing countries that are trying to remain secular and pro-west. Ultimately, this is a threat to U.S. security. This lack of education also leads to tragic global phenomena like the trafficking in women and children: Education would substantially increase awareness regarding the insidious practice of international sex slavery. This involves forcing women and children into prostitution against their will, who are held in slavery-like conditions, having been transported into a strange country. There is a general sentiment in the Congress these days that sanctions have gone too far, that they don't work and that we should remove all of them. I do not share this view, I believe sanctions have a role to play and are appropriate in certain situations. But denying ourselves the opportunity to provide education in a variety of fields in certain parts of the world is counterproductive. We are only hurting ourselves. Instead of being able to implement education programs which would help bring a secular alternative to the lack of education, or the types of schools I mentioned earlier, we find our hands are tied when assistance is denied to a country or when general sanctions are imposed on a country--including sanctions on countries that for one reason or another default on their loans. Yes, we should be able to take political action against countries that are doing bad things; but we should not be put in a situation where programs in education or in anti corruption training is involved. We shouldn't be mandating sanctions in an area, like education, which are of long term assistance to the United States. We sit and complain about such things as corruption or lack of environmental awareness, or lack of democracy, or child labor, or trafficking in women and children. Education could help make a dent in such things, from helping to set up elementary schools, having exchanges at higher school levels, to such things as providing information to people in such areas as economic reform, equitable distribution of wealth, growing their economies, implementation of tax reform and tariff regulation, development of rational and transparent budgeting procedures, development of rule of law and democratic institutions, and privatizing or drafting a commercial code. And yet we occasionally find ourselves in the position of having to deny assistance in the very area which would help fix these problems. That is why I am introducing this amendment today. Denying U.S. assistance to a country is a right we should preserve, but we shouldn't be cutting our ability to influence countries at such a basic level as education and we certainly should do what we can to combat anti- corruption. The most effective way to overcome the anti democratic threats and the lure of terrorism is to go to the root of the problem and to encourage the development of civil society.","word.count":804,"sep11":-1.25561797752809,"years":2000.60393258427,"days":1995,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0898723554050455,"Topic 2":0.120595309770017,"Topic 3":0.0233742580884089,"Topic 4":0.0063592288288286,"Topic 5":0.0104619595372991,"Topic 6":0.0173234356161328,"Topic 7":0.00418710565162885,"Topic 8":0.711293182889958,"Topic 9":0.0103490247907209,"Topic 10":0.00618413942196031},{"id":"10619990039458","body":"Eva Clayton: Reclaiming my time, Mr. Speaker, I thank my distinguished friend, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.

I mean this is the most extraordinary fakery I have ever heard in my life. We are going to shut down the Government but we are not going to shut down the Government. People are still going to get paid, in effect. This is going to cost the American people more money, and the farce of it is the revolution is paying people not to do their jobs. Boy, that is a heck of a change in Washington, DC.","word.count":171,"sep11":-5.98033707865169,"years":1995.87921348315,"days":313,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0238570329194314,"Topic 2":0.0422374630783622,"Topic 3":0.0102209854789551,"Topic 4":0.0128755944904929,"Topic 5":0.00743916101978561,"Topic 6":0.0949643856615252,"Topic 7":0.00551249395756741,"Topic 8":0.400290060728701,"Topic 9":0.355473036254047,"Topic 10":0.0471297864111321},{"id":"10820040045105","body":"Mitch McConnell: Mr. President, let me say in response to my good friend from Nevada, as he knows full well, we have already voted on this once.

This week we celebrate National Police Week. As we honor those who protect us, it is important that we remember those who have fallen in the line of duty. However, more than mere remembrance is necessary. We must work to ensure that the loved ones these officers leave behind are comforted and assisted in every way. The Care for Police Survivors Act does just that. This legislation modifies the Public Safety Officers Death Benefit program, which--as my colleagues know--establishes national programs that counsel and assist the families of slain police officers. The purpose of the Care for Police Survivors Act, which the House of Representatives passed overwhelmingly , is to enhance these national programs. It does so by directing more funds to these programs that counsel and support these families in the aftermath of tragedy. Under current law, these counseling programs have a ceiling of $150,000, this bill changes this to a floor of $150,000. Mr. President, I have long been concerned about the plight of families of public safety officers killed in the line of duty--last year, Senator Specter and I introduced the Public Safety Officers Educational Assistance Act which provides for the education of the spouse and dependent children of law enforcement officers who die or are totally disabled in the line of duty. In that vein, this legislation offers assurance to those in the public safety profession-- and even to those considering service as public safety officers--that there is a well established support system in place to comfort and assist their families and loved ones in the event that they die in the line of duty. Mr. President, it is critical that we not only remember, but offer real help to the families of those police officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice to keep our streets and homes safe.","word.count":339,"sep11":-3.41292134831461,"years":1998.44662921348,"days":1227,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.223111165528664,"Topic 2":0.475687470888745,"Topic 3":0.014477645479714,"Topic 4":0.100308005704537,"Topic 5":0.0616680864666067,"Topic 6":0.0363293466826751,"Topic 7":0.00583430444873153,"Topic 8":0.0333545702676467,"Topic 9":0.0149224434459499,"Topic 10":0.0343069610867303},{"id":"11020070048430","body":"Lamar Smith: Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Missouri for making enormous common sense on a subject where, frankly, the Congress can only be characterized as having a schizophrenic approach to our energy crisis today. Congress always seems to talk a good game, but when it comes to actually doing something about it, the solutions seem to be few and far between. I, too, think it is important to remember that since Speaker Pelosi made that promise 2 years ago, we have not had anything happen in the Congress that would indicate that this ``commonsense plan to help bring down skyrocketing gas prices'' is any closer today than it was 2 years ago. You would think, if any party has a commonsense solution to help reduce the pain at the pump, they would be eager to unveil it and to debate it on the floor, to show it off. But, of course, as we finished out the 2006 session of Congress, we got no such bill. So again, as elections are heating up, and, as we all know, our constituents back home are feeling the pain at the pump--and whereas there is a lot of concern today about food prices--a lot of the increase in food prices is caused because of increased costs of production on the farm, primarily energy costs. Again, we see that as it becomes a political football, it has become something to talk about in election season. But when it comes to the fact that now our Democratic friends have control of both Houses of Congress, we have seen no action--zero action--taken to reduce the price of gas. The price of gas, as we know, has continued to go up. Here is a chart that indicates--right here on Capitol Hill--that back in, I guess we can call it, the good old days, unleaded regular was $3.09 a gallon. Today, in April 2008, it is $3.49 a gallon, right here in Washington, DC. In some parts of the country, it is approaching $4 a gallon. While $3.09 is certainly not a low price by anybody's reckoning, it certainly looks pretty good today. But, frankly, we have not seen our colleagues on the other side of the aisle work with us to support any legislation that would be calculated to bring down the price of gas at the pump. As a matter of fact, this is calculated into the inaction as a result of the energy policies by the majority, and you see it costs the average American family $1,400 a year in additional energy costs, additional gasoline costs. So while the majority, which really runs the Congress, is quick to blame others for high oil prices, it is, in fact, their inaction that continues to raise gas prices. I wonder how long it will be before our friends on the other side of the aisle--who won the last election, who claimed a mandate as a result of that election--are actually going to act like the majority that they now are and help work with us to bring down prices at the pump. How long will it be before they stop pointing the finger of blame and start looking in the mirror for the solutions? The only way we are going to resolve this schizophrenia when it comes to our energy policy is by Republicans and Democrats working together to pass commonsense legislation which will have the effect of bringing down the price of gasoline at the pump. I will talk about some of those in a minute. The simple truth is, those who have been entrusted with the majority in the Senate and the House have failed to act to lower energy prices at all. Rather than show us their commonsense solution, as Speaker Pelosi talked about, they have opted to pursue political posturing, which has done nothing to deal with the problem. So, as we see, the problem just gets worse and worse and worse. Now, our side does not have all the answers, but we have proposed some good solutions, I think, which would help address America's growing energy crisis that we should and could act upon to start bringing the price of gas down. Let me say, first of all, there are several reasons why the price of gasoline is so high today. First and foremost is skyrocketing consumption in other parts of the world. This commodity is in great demand, and we are competing literally with the entire world for this scarce commodity known as oil that is then refined to make gasoline. Of course, we know there remains political unrest in producing countries as well. Every one of these problems could be mitigated, if not solved outright, by promoting and investing in America's natural resources rather than continuing to be so dependent on imported oil and gas from dangerous parts of the world and from our enemies such as Hugo Chavez in Venezuela. We are a politically stable nation with the resources to invest in maintaining our infrastructure and to add production that would greatly increase the available oil and gas supply. All of that adds up to lower costs at the pump and more money in the pockets of American citizens. There is a lot Congress can do that would be positive, but the one thing we can't do is to repeal the law of supply and demand. When you have a fixed supply and the demand goes up, the price invariably goes up. I don't know why Congress refuses to acknowledge that simple law of economics of supply and demand, and add to the supply. First and foremost, we need to increase American energy production right here at home. Unfortunately, we see time after time and, again, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle block commonsense energy policies that would give American companies access to valuable resources such as oil deposits in the Arctic, in Alaska, the Outer Continental Shelf, on Government lands, and shale oil sites that have great promise in terms of the volume of oil that can be produced, the major component of gasoline. Of all of the cost drivers in gasoline, it is the price of oil that causes the greatest increase. If we could increase the supply of oil by increasing America's supply of oil by developing the resources we have in our country, it would vastly improve the situation we are in now. In addition to lowering prices at the pump and increasing domestic energy production, it would also create more jobs in America. At a time when Congress is passing economic stimulus programs, spending enormous sums of taxpayer money, one of the best things we could simply do is to change the policies that would allow us to explore and develop our own natural resources rather than depend on imported oil from foreign sources. Personally, I have always liked to see the ``Made in America'' label when I buy a product. Wouldn't it be nice to see that on the side of a gas pump here at home? Think of the thousands of jobs that could help kick-start our economy if we actually encouraged American energy production and less dependence on foreign sources. Beyond increasing the supply of oil, we also need to increase our refinery capacity, the place where that oil is then made into gasoline. We haven't built any new refineries in this country since the 1970s because of restrictive policies of the Federal Government. One of the most costly steps in producing gasoline is refining oil to make it usable in vehicles. Since we have limited refining capacity--again, the law of supply and demand--a fixed supply and increasing demand is driving up the cost of gasoline because we don't have the refinery capacity to make the gasoline out of the oil. So prices continue to go up. Finally, any American energy policy must, of course, include alternative sources of energy. We need to look to technology in our American legacy of innovation and research to help reduce our need on oil and gas, whether domestic or foreign. But that is not going to happen overnight. It is not going to happen even in the near term. But long term, clean coal technology, nuclear energy, even biofuels and wind energy can help reduce the strain on our gas supply by taking some of the energy load off of oil. We need to be careful not to cherry-pick a few politically correct solutions. We have already seen the increase in the cost of food, in significant part because of food being used for fuel. Even with the best of intentions of an ethanol policy, it has created an impending crisis when it comes to using food for fuel. I think it is time for us to take definitive steps to help reduce the cost of gasoline at the pump. We have some solutions, if we would get some cooperation on the other side of the aisle. Since the Democrats are now in charge, we would expect them to lead, to keep the promise that Speaker Pelosi made 2 years ago. We wish to help them come up with a commonsense plan to help bring down skyrocketing gas prices. But continued obstruction, continued schizophrenia, and continued reliance on politically correct solutions which sometimes end up backfiring is not the way forward. The American people are looking to us for a solution and it is high time we deliver. I yield the floor.","word.count":328,"sep11":6.25280898876404,"years":2008.11235955056,"days":4668,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.122646571161531,"Topic 2":0.311300442187003,"Topic 3":0.0279034223889049,"Topic 4":0.0089772421203354,"Topic 5":0.136975400733998,"Topic 6":0.21267295029165,"Topic 7":0.00616267779073056,"Topic 8":0.128282742801581,"Topic 9":0.0342077838217722,"Topic 10":0.0108707667024932},{"id":"10619990029094","body":"Charles Taylor: Mr. Speaker, let me begin by stating there is no Member of this body who wants to tax seniors.

It is unfortunate that government continues to burden its citizens with excessive and unfair taxation. Indeed, America's income tax system reduces freedom and economic growth. An embarrassing example of this inequity is the marriage penalty--essentially, a quirk in the income tax code that causes some married couples to be penalized and taxed at higher rates, simply because they marry. The treatment of marriage provides an important example of why we need to support equity in the tax code. Consider that two couples who are exactly the same--except one is married and the other couple is not. A peculiar feature in our tax code is that these two couples may pay different taxes. Simply put, when a man and woman get married, their tax liability can rise and the federal government can take more of the married couple's money. This is a fundamental problem in the tax code. I believe in fairness and simplicity when it comes to taxes. A married couple should not pay more taxes than an unmarried couple with the same total income. This is poor policy. Marriage neutrality is the principle that when two people get married, their total bill should not change. Unfortunately, the U.S. income tax is not marriage neutral. According to the Congressional Budget Office, almost half of all married couples--22 million--suffered from the marriage penalty last year. In my home state of Idaho, 129,710 couples were adversely affected because of this system. These married couples on average paid an extra $1,500 in income tax. Moreover, as women are working hard to achieve salary equity, it is unfortunate that as women approach income levels similar to their husbands, the marriage penalty increasingly kicks in and the federal government simply takes their money back. Under this bill, beginning next year, Congress will restore marriage neutrality to the code. The Marriage Tax Penalty Relief Reconciliation Act will increase the standard deduction for married couples to approximately $8,800. This is twice the basic standard deduction for a single tax filer. The bill will also widen the 15 percent and 28 percent income tax brackets for married couples filing a joint return to twice the size of the corresponding rate brackets of single individuals. This is a commonsense solution to ending any disparity for married couples who find they are paying a penalty. Fortunately for them, the rules under which we are debating the Marriage Tax Penalty Relief Reconciliation Act will also shield senators from excess delay and we will have an up-or-down vote. True to the bill's name, we are here to reconcile an unfair tax provision that is counterproductive to our goal of equity and fairness. Today, we have finally put an end to expensive entitlements and the reckless fiscal behavior that created large deficits in the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s. Indeed, the surging U.S. economy has produced an unprecedented tidal wave of federal tax receipts. This year, the country will see a $76 billion dollar surplus--over the next ten years the non-social security surplus is estimated at $1.9 trillion. This raises the question: when will the government start returning money to the people? With these surpluses there is no doubt that there is room for marriage tax relief and additional debt reduction. Therefore, we should seize this opportunity to return these surplus dollars, before the bureaucrats in town start spending them. If we do not, an opportunity to restore horizontal equity to the tax code will be lost, because surpluses--like we have today--will certainly invite an irresponsible flurry of new spending. Americans have historically and consistently expressed their discontent for excessive and unfair taxation. I have stacks of letters in my office from honest and hard-working Idahoans who rightfully want to know where their tax cut is. Let us take this opportunity to return something to those American families who are married and working to support families and loved ones. Let us make good on our constituent promise by voting to eliminate the marriage tax penalty and let us give the President an opportunity to honor his State of the Union promise by signing this bill. The federal tax code remains intrusive, overly complicated, and excessively burdensome. As part of my effort to bring tax relief to the American people, I have co-sponsored or voted for legislation to reduce the death tax, gas tax, beer tax, and telephone excise tax. Today, we have an opportunity to vote for a bill that I hope will have broad bipartisan support. Senators should be mindful of the opportunity to provide needed relief to married couples. Death and taxes are certainties in life. Let us vote to ensure that fairness is too. I urge my colleagues to support repeal of the marriage tax penalty. It is the right thing to do.","word.count":809,"sep11":-1.18258426966292,"years":2000.67696629213,"days":2021,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.522909608043082,"Topic 2":0.121897635201131,"Topic 3":0.0372720540874255,"Topic 4":0.021150665766391,"Topic 5":0.0102366677539048,"Topic 6":0.0207404200081413,"Topic 7":0.036483297444184,"Topic 8":0.0285898409172291,"Topic 9":0.194632314810553,"Topic 10":0.00608749596795888},{"id":"10720010011431","body":"Dennis Kucinich: Mr. Speaker, I want to take this time, and I will be joined by some of my colleagues a little later, I hope, to talk on this special order on the floor this evening about a very important issue facing this country today, maybe one of the key issues.

I had the occasion over the last couple of weeks, and I make an effort to visit schools about every week, but I went to a school down in part of my district, Anderson Creek Elementary, and visited with the principal, Ms. Cobb, and an awful lot of the teachers and students. They have a program where they encourage children to read. It is really a kindergarten through about fourth grade reading program. Some of the schools I am going to mention actually do it in the higher grades. She got those young people so excited about reading by giving them certificates and tee shirts, and getting the parents involved through kindergarten, that those youngsters in that school, and there are about roughly 700 elementary school students, over 545 of them read at least 100 books. They had read a total of over 155,000 books this year; probably more than that by now. When we talk about good things, those are the kinds of things that make a difference. Because if a youngster learns to read and they learn to do math and they learn to communicate, that will make a difference. They will be successful students. I went to North Harnett Elementary the same day, where the leading reader in that school had read 410 books. It is amazing to me that a youngster would read 410 books and still do his or her homework. At Anderson Creek, they had one student who read 545 books. The children in that school had read a substantial number. It is sort of contagious. These are good things happening in Harnett County. Lafayette Elementary, the same thing. They went in, had an assembly, and they honored the students. Their program was titled Reading Around the World, where they actually put flags of nations around the world about which the youngsters had read. They got involved. They had tee shirts and they got certificates, and they honored top readers. These are the things we do not hear a lot about, but we always hear people critical of those people who are giving so much time in the classroom who really are creative, innovative, and thinking about how do we make things better for children. Then I went to Cleveland Elementary School, a school in the community I grew up in. The same kind of thing: a very caring principal and assistant principal, with an awful lot of hard-working, focused teachers. They were doing the program not only in reading, but in a number of other areas, and they were giving out certificates. Children were really and truly getting ready to build a strong foundation for the future, things we were not doing 10 or 20 years ago. I went over to East Clayton Elementary School over near Clayton, and the same kind of thing: a very focused principal providing great leadership, and teachers who were caring, creative, and making a difference. I only mention these schools because they are representative not only of just schools in my congressional district or in my State of North Carolina, but I happen to think they are representative of teachers and students and principals and administrators all across this country. Do we have problems? Sure. Do we need to improve? Absolutely. But they are about making a difference. This is the way we improve it. I have learned a long time ago that if we want to improve education, we lay out a plan, we work with the people, and we give them encouragement. It is awful easy to be critical. It is a lot like a little poem I use many times, and I think my colleagues would benefit from that, because it reminds me of being an architect. It takes a long time to go to school to be an architect. It takes a number of years. But the last time I checked, if we want to hire somebody to tear a building down, we can put them in a machine and put a ball at the end of a chain and we can knock it down pretty quick. Too many times we have people who unfortunately are willing to tear down, but are not willing to help be architects. We not only need architects to build buildings, we need architects in our classrooms. We have them in teachers; we need more. Yes, we need resources to help train them better, because the needs for our teachers are changing every day. I think that is the key issue in education, is that we give encouragement where it is needed. Certainly, we give counsel when it is not working out. If we have people who are not doing the job, then we need to take appropriate action, like we would do in any other area. But we ought to acknowledge when our teachers and our administrators and people who work with our children every day are doing a good job. Let me just share with Members, if I may, before I get to some prepared remarks, I read an article recently that I want to just read some pieces out of. It is by Gerald Bracey, and it was in The Washington Post. I think it is right on target when we are talking about education. It says, ``Why do we scapegoat the schools?'' I could not help but think, there is a lot of truth in this. I think I know a little bit about this. I said to my colleagues when they came here, I served as State superintendent of schools of North Carolina for 8 years. That is an elective office in North Carolina, like the governor and some others. There is one thing I learned. We may not know all the answers of what to do, but I know some of the things that do not work. Sometimes that is worth an awful lot. Gerald Bracey made this point: ``There is no pleasing some people, even when they get what they want. So why do we keep listening to them? For more than 20 years now, people have been bashing our schools.'' He goes all the way back to the time when the Russians put up the Sputnik, and we got all carried away in this country and said our math and science programs are in shambles, our schools are failing us, our schools need to be fixed, so we put together a program. Lo and behold, with President Kennedy's focus and commitment, and yes, this Congress, the House and Senate put in resources behind it, and I emphasize, resources, and translated, that is money behind it, we put a man on the moon before the end of the decade. But Bracey goes on to say, we didn't say to the public schools, you are no longer in crisis, you have done a good job. You make this happen. Then all of a sudden, we walked along, and they did not get credit for what they had done. We stayed quiet. All of a sudden, after that happened, he said that there was no declaration that the crisis in education was over, and the question was raised, do pigs fly? Translated, that is that we did not give them the credit; it was assumed they had to do it. He goes on to talk about, again, he says, ``I don't mean to suggest, of course, that America's public schools are perfect. The dreary state of some urban and poor rural school systems is well documented.'' I would agree with that. He said, ``But I have been following the anguish over our competitive capabilities since the '83 report, and I've noticed the same pattern. In the early nineties, as the economy tanked and the recession set in, many variations of `Lousy schools are producing a lousy work force and it is killing us in the global market' could be heard, but those slackards somehow managed to turn things around. By early 1994, many publications featured banner headlines about the recovery that later became the longest sustained period of economic growth in the Nation's history. And then, `The American economy, back on top,' was the way that The New York Times summed up the turnaround in February of 1994.'' Well, did the public schools have anything to do with that? Were the people that were employed in those businesses all of a sudden better 2 years later than they were 2 years before? Did we give them any credit for that happening? No. They continued to be hammered. He goes on to say, ``Looking at a number of the different rankings of schools and school reports, the United States looked particularly bad in one DEF category: the difference in quality between rich and poor schools. We finished 42nd lower than any other developed nation, which is shameful for a rich nation.'' So if 26 nations had better schools, how did we wind up being number 2 in competitive ranking of all the nations in the wor","word.count":621,"sep11":-0.23314606741573,"years":2001.62640449438,"days":2359,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.00387382920545596,"Topic 2":0.0331577583881033,"Topic 3":0.273781870034703,"Topic 4":0.00263005917723134,"Topic 5":0.190292938076554,"Topic 6":0.0155314376386872,"Topic 7":0.0182769390499973,"Topic 8":0.372541832555195,"Topic 9":0.0731051172799074,"Topic 10":0.0168082185941653},{"id":"11020080040336","body":"Mitch McConnell: Reserving the right to object, let me just make the point once again that we just passed this bill 68 to 29 in its initial form, which was preserved on the Senate floor.

This legislation, which I am cosponsoring along with Chairman Filner is a bipartisan measure consisting of the construction bill the House of Representatives passed on May 21, 2008, as well as language from the bill I introduced on August 1, 2008, H.R. 6802, the Veterans Authorities Extension Act of 2008, and additional authorizations. The provisions included from the Committee reported and House passed construction bill, H.R. 5856, would authorize major VA medical facility projects and leases for fiscal year 2009. Included in this legislation is an authorization of $66 million for construction of a fifth Polytrauma Rehabilitation Center in San Antonio, Texas. VA's four existing Polytrauma Centers are located in Richmond, Virginia; Tampa, Florida; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Palo Alto, California. Mr. Speaker, this past February, I had the pleasure of visiting the Audie Murphy VA Medical Center in San Antonio for a briefing on this new project, which will provide state-of-the-art care to our severely injured heroes. The VA Polytrauma Centers are designed to provide comprehensive inpatient rehabilitation services for individuals with complex, severe and disabling traumas. By creating a fifth Polytrauma Center in San Antonio, our commitment to veterans and servicemembers is reinforced by expanding access to the southwestern United States. H.R. 6832 also will provide the extension of a number of important authorizations. These include: Repeal of the sunset on inclusion of non-institutional extended care services; Extension of recovery audit authority; Permanent authority for provision of hospital care, medical services, and nursing home care to veterans who participated in certain chemical and biological testing; Extension of expiring collections authorities; Extension of nursing home care; Extension of authority to carry out income verification; Extension of certain home loan guaranty programs; Extension of requirement to submit an annual report on the Special Committee on PTSD; Permanent requirement for the biannual report on the Women's Advisory Committee; and Permanent authority for VA's Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans . The bill will also increase the number of veterans participating in the VA's Independent Living Program, and will enhance the refinancing of home loans by veterans. I would like to thank Chairman Filner, as well as Health Subcommittee Chairman Michael Michaud of Maine and Ranking Member Jeff Miller of Florida, for their efforts to bring this legislation through the Committee and on to the House floor for consideration. I would also like to commend the Committee staff for their hard work and bipartisan efforts throughout this Congress. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6832, the Department of Veterans Affairs Construction and Extensions Act of 2008.","word.count":566,"sep11":5.94101123595506,"years":2007.80056179775,"days":4557,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.252812162803037,"Topic 2":0.0857787720238962,"Topic 3":0.011943898218032,"Topic 4":0.251881420441358,"Topic 5":0.097078221150527,"Topic 6":0.00492518355129454,"Topic 7":0.0475622825969555,"Topic 8":0.0748472882233992,"Topic 9":0.132093389455388,"Topic 10":0.0410773815361124},{"id":"10519980016701","body":"Carolyn Maloney: Mr. Speaker I rise today to discuss the 2000 census and in particular the two lawsuits that have been generated because of the 2000 census. As many of my colleagues know, Speaker Gingrich and the gentleman from Georgia each have filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the use of statistical methods when conducting a census. What my colleagues may not know is that 25 other Members of Congress who support the use of statistical methods when conducting a census have joined those two lawsuits to make sure that our position is represented in the court system. As a Member of that group of 25, I want to give the Members of this House a status report on the two lawsuits. On Monday, April 6, 1998, the administration moved to dismiss both lawsuits on the constitutional grounds that the plaintiffs, Gingrich and Barr, lack standing to sue the Census Bureau because they will not be harmed by the proposed plan and that the cases are not yet ripe for adjudication because the census is 2 years away. The rhetoric from Members opposed to an accurate census suggests that the administration is hiding behind the procedural issues of standing and ripeness. This is simply not the case. As everyone knows, each case brought before a court must be reviewed procedurally before it can be reviewed on its merits. A case cannot go forward if it is not procedurally sound. The administration has repeatedly stated that it is eager to argue the merits of the case; however, it believes it has a legal obligation to also argue standing. Even if the administration did not bring up the issue of standing, a court has an obligation to dismiss a case if it is not procedurally sound, regardless of what the parties to the lawsuit allege. My colleagues should remember that standing is also a provision of the Constitution. You cannot violate the Constitution, even with a wink and a nod, in order to get a ruling on the use of modern technology in the census. What is not mentioned by my friends opposed to a fair and accurate census is that the administration in its motion to dismiss also argued the case on the merits, stating that the statistical method plan is both constitutional and in accord with the Census Act. Therefore, in addition to the procedural issues, the administration points out that the two cases should be dismissed on substantive issues as well. Some of my colleagues may remember that there was a court challenge to the Line-Item Veto Act by some Members of Congress in January 1996. Congress passed the Line-Item Veto Act effective January 1996. Within the act, Congress created the right of expedited judicial review and attempted to create standing for Members of Congress. Therefore, shortly after the effective date, some Members of Congress filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the Line-Item Veto Act. The defendants in the line-item veto case filed a motion to dismiss on procedural grounds. In that case, the Supreme Court upheld the Federal court's dismissal of the January 1996 Line-Item Veto Act challenge stating that the Members did not have standing to sue. Likewise, with regard to the 2000 census, we have the 1998 Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations Act creating the right to expedited judicial review and attempting to create standing for Members of Congress to sue. Just like the January 1996 line-item veto case, these two lawsuits are being challenged on procedural grounds. Constitutional scholars agree that these two cases lack the necessary procedural requirements to move forward. The courts cannot give advisory opinions as these two cases request. My anti-accurate census friends continually point to the Constitution when discussing the sampling details of the 2000 census but ignore the part of the Constitution that states that there must be a case in controversy in order for it to proceed and considered on the merits. The Constitution is very clear on that point. I am as eager as anyone to have the courts review the substantive issues surrounding the use of modern statistical methods when conducting a census. I believe that if these cases reach the merits, the courts will determine, and the Supreme Court will uphold, that the 2000 census plan is constitutional and in accord with the Census Act. I would love to have these issues decided by the courts which are in the business of interpreting statutes and the Constitution. In the meantime, I think it is imperative to set the record straight. Neither the administration nor the 25 Members who have joined the two lawsuits are afraid of discussing the merits of the two cases. We have said it before and we will say it again and again. The Census Bureau will obtain a fair and accurate count only by using statistical, modern methods. This week in both the District and Virginia courts, there will be hearings at which each side will plead its case. On Thursday, arguments will be heard in Washington, D.C. and on Friday in Virginia. I am confident that we will prevail in the courts and in the court of public opinion. The American people deserve a fair and accurate census in which every person, rich or poor, black or white or Hispanic or Asian, is accounted for. The President has put forward a plan that will account for all Americans. The opponents of this plan want to repeat the errors of the past because they believe it is to their political advantage. The President's plan is true to the Constitution in both word and spirit, and it is the only plan that is fair to all people.","word.count":944,"sep11":-3.34269662921348,"years":1998.51685393258,"days":1252,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.042585536393139,"Topic 2":0.133296988327522,"Topic 3":0.177765712933312,"Topic 4":0.00641037069309726,"Topic 5":0.178012103483885,"Topic 6":0.441345577611675,"Topic 7":0.00721797464268053,"Topic 8":0.00735721952375461,"Topic 9":0.00386870708772691,"Topic 10":0.00213980930320673},{"id":"10419950140924","body":"Kit Bond: Mr. President, I thank Senator Warner, Congressman Shuster, and the other conferees for agreeing to include a provision in the National Highway System bill ensuring that public highways connecting the NHS to ports, airports, and other intermodal transportation facilities will be eligible for NHS funds without further delay. One of the main reasons for creating the NHS was to establish intermodal facility connections. But few of the connectors are included on the current NHS map and the Department of Transportation is not expected to have a list of additional connectors ready until after enactment of this legislation. To ensure that NHS funding for the connectors on DOT's list is not further delayed, the bill makes them eligible for such assistance on an interim basis. While I would have preferred the Senate passed bill language, this provision represents a reasonable compromise and should achieve the same results. There is one matter dealing with the interim eligibility provision on which I would appreciate the chairman's clarification, however. The provision refers to a project to construct a connector to an intermodal transportation facility. It is my understanding that the word ``construct'' is to be read very broadly to include not only construction and reconstruction projects, but also ones involving resurfacing, restoration, rehabilitation, and operational improvements, such as the installation of traffic surveillance and control equipment and computerized signal systems.","word.count":226,"sep11":-5.96910112359551,"years":1995.8904494382,"days":317,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0632253367987028,"Topic 2":0.0922622594115225,"Topic 3":0.171500349165599,"Topic 4":0.0305238696405731,"Topic 5":0.37292946684451,"Topic 6":0.012536109449275,"Topic 7":0.215047972580554,"Topic 8":0.0192894466299721,"Topic 9":0.0173137519226114,"Topic 10":0.00537143755668083},{"id":"11020080027774","body":"Wally Herger: Mr. Speaker, I rise today in the strongest opposition to this dangerously irresponsible resolution. For over 40 years, millions of seniors across America have enjoyed longer and healthier lives as a result of the health care provided through the Medicare program. Yet as a result of demographic changes and rising health care costs, Medicare is now in dire financial straits. The numbers are absolutely staggering. According to the most recent report by Medicare's Board of Trustees, Medicare's unfunded obligations have surpassed $85 trillion. That's more than six times the annual output of our entire economy, and more than fifteen times the current federal debt held by the public. We have a choice to make: Are we going to take action now to save Medicare for the future? Or are we going to ignore the problem and hope that it just goes away? I understand that many members might prefer not to deal with this issue in an election year. But the Medicare funding warning trigger was designed precisely to force Congress to confront an issue that many would rather ignore. And that's what the American people sent us here to do: confront the tough challenges facing our country's future. Even when that means taking some political risks. The President has proposed some fairly modest reforms to begin shoring up Medicare's future. I personally thought his suggestions made sense. But under the trigger rules, the Majority was entirely free to reject the President's ideas and develop their own proposal for reining in the growth of Medicare. Instead, the Majority has chosen to take the easy way out and do nothing. Today, we are sending a message to the American people that this Congress is simply not up to the task of solving our nation's problems. The truth is, Mr. Speaker, we are gambling with our future. I believe we have an obligation to do our best to leave America better off for the generations that will follow us.

Since its inception, Democrats have been the party to keep Medicare working for America's seniors and disabled. Contrast that with Republicans when they were in charge. During their majority, Medicare funding increased dramatically so they could shower their pals in the insurance industry with higher reimbursements than regular Medicare, all in an effort to privatize the program. Republicans are willing to look past all of that, pat themselves on the back and call themselves the party of fiscal responsibility because of some arbitrary policy that they inserted into the Medicare Modernization Act that pretends to address Medicare financing. This provision is more about smoke and mirrors than it is about ensuring Medicare remains intact. Republicans say it is about cost containment; I say it is about cost shifting. The sad truth is that the 45 percent trigger is designed to reduce the obligation of the Federal Government to fund part of Medicare, thereby shifting more costs to beneficiaries. Since taking control of Congress, Democrats have set out to put Medicare on a sustainable track. During our first year in charge, the House passed the CHAMP Act which would have extended Medicare solvency by 2 years by reducing wasteful overpayments to Medicare Advantage plans. And just a couple of weeks ago, we enacted the Medicare Improvements for Patient and Providers of 2008 against the President's objections.

Although we are both people who love liberty and justice and value our freedom that we have here in the United States and in various countries throughout the world, we have a different view on exactly what policies the United States should follow to ensure that there is the maximum of peace and liberty and justice in this world. Today I would like to talk a little bit about where we are at in the world and why we are there and some thoughts, some basic thoughts about American foreign policy. First and foremost on this subject, we must recognize that our military forces are at this moment in action in various parts of the world, especially in Afghanistan, and they are there and they are fighting and sometimes they are taking casualties in order to avenge the slaughter of nearly 3,000 of our fellow Americans on September 11 past. This forceful and deadly response in the form of American military forces being unleashed against persons in different parts of the world is totally justified. It will and, in fact, already has deterred other terrorist attacks upon us. It is, yes, part of an act of vengeance, and I see nothing wrong with the United States Government avenging the death of 3,000 Americans who were killed, 3,000 innocent Americans, people who were not combatants who were slaughtered by evil forces overseas. And in this vengeance we will, as I say, deter other evil forces in this world from targeting Americans and from committing other heinous acts that have caused us so much grief here with the loss of friends and family. All Americans should be grateful for the magnificent job that has been done by our military personnel, and let us remember as we are watching this great victory that we have just had in Afghanistan that there were naysayers who were warning us not to do anything militarily in Afghanistan, that it would become a quagmire and that any time we commit military forces anywhere that it is so risky that we should just forget it. There is a saying of a captain of a ship, if a captain of a ship believes that his number one job is preserving the ship, well, then he will never leave port. Well, the ship of the United States has one important purpose, they have many purposes, our ship of state, but the most important purpose of our Federal Government is to protect the people of the United States and to protect our freedom. It is not simply to watch events go by. It is not simply to have a military for which we pay for our military, only to see it there and to caress it and to salute it and to say good things about it. No, our military is there and the people who are in our military understand they have a job to do. At times that means that they must leave port and they must go to foreign destinations in order to protect the national security interests of our country and in order to prevent our people from suffering the kind of attacks that we suffered on September 11. When we do not do that and when dictators and tyrants and evil-doers around the world see the United States has no more stomach for that type of conflict in distant places, then we will indeed become the target because there are evil people around the world who hate everything that the United States stands for and envy the prosperity and freedom of our people. The naysayers, if we remember, said the same thing about Saddam Hussein's attack and invasion and subjugation of Kuwait. The naysayers said we better not get into that war because Saddam Hussein kept playing on their psyche, the Vietnam psyche. This is going to be the mother of all wars. Well, what happened in Kuwait and in Iraq 10 years ago and what just happened in Afghanistan in these recent months should indicate to us when America is on the right side and we are doing what is right and opposing aggression and supporting those people who believe in freedom and democracy, that we will, we will win, and that we will be on the side of those people in those areas on which we are fighting, and that it will not become a quagmire because we are doing what is right and just. For the record, not aggressively responding to the invasion, Iraq's invasion of Kuwait or not aggressively responding to the atrocities committed against us on September 11 would have been a much riskier strategy than unleashing a military counterattack, which is what we did. But Americans need to understand that these two conflicts, while our military have went in in these conflicts and altered the course of history and defeated the tyrants, defeated the terrorists, the American people need to know that that military action might not have been necessary had we in place policies which would have prevented the attacks in the first place. It was bad policy on the part of the United States that led Saddam Hussein to attack Kuwait. It was bad policy on the part of the United States that led bin Laden and the Taliban to conclude that they could conduct murderous attacks on the people of the United States and that they would not suffer the consequences. The fact is in terms of Iraq, during the fast moving and somewhat confusing days at the close of the Cold War, a high ranking foreign policy official from George Bush's administration, meaning George Bush, Senior, the first President Bush, an Ambassador April Gillespie, misinformed Saddam Hussein as to our country's position on Iraq's claim to Kuwait. She stated that we considered Iraq's claim on Kuwait and the threats of Saddam Hussein to invade Kuwait to be an internal matter of Iraq. She stated it very clearly and it has been printed since, an internal matter. That is what Saddam Hussein contemplated when he tried to decide whether to unleash his military forces against Kuwait. It was a miscalculation on his part, but due to a bad policy statement by our own government, a mistake by our own government, a mistake by the previous Bush administration. Well, that classic misstatement on Ambassador April Gillespie's part led to the invasion of Kuwait and the Gulf War that followed. That was a policy error, and I might add, when some people suggest when I criticized the last administration for its mistakes and misdeeds that they are claiming that I am being partisan, let me just note that I am fully recognizing that mistakes often have happened in Republican administrations, and I just gave an example of that. What we must do in order to fully understand what happened on September 11 is to take a look at the government policies and the events that led up to September 11. I worked in the White House during the Ronald Reagan years, during those years when Reagan put an end to the Cold War, and ended those Reagan years with the dismantling of the Communist dictatorship that controlled Russia and the puppet states. Part of that effort on the part of Ronald Reagan, of course, to bring the Soviet Union down or at least end the Cold War was President Reagan's strategy that the United States should support people throughout the world who are struggling to free themselves from Communist tyranny, especially those people who are struggling to free themselves from Soviet occupation. The bravest and most fierce of these anti-Soviet insurgents were in Afghanistan, and the American people can be proud that we provided the Afghan people with the weapons they needed to win their own freedom and independence. That Cold War battle was a major factor in breaking the will of the Communist bosses in Moscow and thus ending the Cold War. By ending the Cold War, we made everyone on this planet, especially those people who live in the Western democracies, we made them safer, we made them more prosperous. In our own country, it resulted in 10 years where spending on the military was able to decrease in the range of hundreds of billions of dollars, which then went into our economy in different ways, and all of this can be traced back to Ronald Reagan's strategies and traced back to the people of Afghanistan who fought for their freedom and independence and under the Soviet bosses and the crack in the Soviet leadership led to its downfall. However, we must take a look here at this strategy and at this moment in history at the end of the Cold War to fully understand the crime of September 11. One of the common errors found in trying to understand September 11 is the suggestion that those holding power in Afghanistan today are the same people that we supported who were fighting against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s. This by and large is wrong. It is inaccurate. Yes, some of those who are currently or were in power during the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, some of those in the Taliban regime did fight the Russians, there is no doubt about it, but by and large those people who were in the leadership of the Taliban were not in the leadership of those people who fought with the Mujahedin that fought against the Russians, the Soviet Union. In fact, I do not know of one of the major factional leaders of the Mujahedin who fought the Russians when the Soviets occupied Afghanistan; not one of those became a major leader in the Taliban. So those who fought Soviet occupation, the Mujahedin, were different from those people who later took over as the Taliban.

Now, let me just give you a little bit of history about this. Originally the goal was to consolidate the four USGS mapping sites and find the office that would be most competitive against the private sector. This is according to the former USGS Director. And Rolla, Missouri, the facility that we have today, has scored the best out of all of the criteria that the USGS committee put together for this planning. As a matter of fact, it scored 4.18 out of a possible 5, and Denver scored 2.84 out of a 5. The USGS planning committee actually recommended that the mapping center be located in Rolla, but it was subsequently decided by one individual within USGS to move it arbitrarily, so that it would lose against private competitors. And let me also say that the Inspector General who did a report at the request of Senators Bond, Talent and I, has found that USGS ``failed to effectively and transparently demonstrate the entirety of its criteria or communicate the magnitude of its rationale.'' In effect, the decision was made by one person who dismissed an entire team and planning process which was convened to select the site.

Dicks: Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend from California yielding time to me. I want to talk today about a rather complicated issue, and I am pleased that the rule allows us to consider this amendment. This is an issue that involves the continued existence of California's marbled murrelet. The marbled murrelet is a rare sea bird that nests in forests along the Pacific coast. It is a small bird that spends much of its time at sea feeding on fish. However, during certain crucial months each year it nests in California's coniferous forests. The marbled murrelet is listed as endangered under the California Endangered Species Act and threatened under the Federal Endangered Species Act. My colleague and member of the Committee on Appropriations, the gentleman from California [Mr. Riggs], has a rider on the Interior bill attached in committee last week which could lead to the extinction, unfortunately, of the California marbled murrelet. The Riggs amendment prohibits implementation of critical habitat designation under the Federal Endangered Species Act for the marbled murrelet. The rider would apply to most of the private lands in the northern coastal area of California that has been identified as critical habitat for the marbled murrelet. If critical habitat in this California area does not continue to be designated, there is strong likelihood of the marbled murrelet extinction in northern California, which will most likely affect the bird throughout its Pacific Northwest range. The Riggs amendment excludes from its coverage 3,000 acres commonly called the ``Headquarters Grove,'' but this exception does not include headwaters areas that are crucial for survival of the bird in California. For example, the exception does not include the Owl Creek Forest, a 440-acre stand of old growth coastal coniferous forest that contains a key 137-acre marbled murrelet nesting area. The Riggs amendment does not provide needed protection for private property because critical habitat designation does not stop private activities. Critical habitat designation on private land does not stop activities, but it results in more careful consideration before Federal agencies carry out, approve, or fund activities. Critical habitat designation impacts only Federal, not private, actions. For private land, critical habitat will come into consideration when the landowner seeks some Federal permit or approval, such as an incidental take permit. Moreover, while critical habitat designation may change the Fish and Wildlife Service's calculus in granting a take permit, it does not trigger the incidental take process. If marbled murrelets will not be injured or killed by logging or designating habitat, the logging can proceed without a permit. The marbled murrelet is dependent on little areas that remain. In California, over the past 150 years, we have taken and harvested much of the marbled murrelet's nesting habitat. The number of birds in California has dropped from an estimated historic population of 60,000 to only about 6,000. Because of the marbled murrelet's precarious situation, further destruction of its significant habitat makes extinction of the northern California population probable. The marbled murrelet has special nesting requirements. Every year the species loses a majority of its chicks to predation; therefore, it can nest successfully only where foliage is thick enough for the chicks to hide from predators. In addition, marbled murrelets do not build typical nests; instead, they lay eggs in natural depressions on tree limbs, so they require large limb structures. Critical habitat designation has focused on Federal land. In May 1996 critical habitat was designated for the marbled murrelet along the Pacific coast. Slightly over 1 percent of the designation occurred on private land, because the Fish and Wildlife Service worked to designate non-Federal lands as critical habitat only ``where Federal lands are limited or nonexistent and where non-Federal lands are essential for maintaining marbled murrelet populations and nesting habitats.'' A total of about 48,000 private acres were designated as critical habitat for the bird. The Riggs amendment applies to almost all this area, most of which is owned by the Pacific Lumber Co. The marbled murrelet draft recovery plan emphasizes the importance of these acres for marbled murrelet recovery. Suitable nesting habitat on Pacific Lumber Co. lands in Humboldt County, CA, is the only, and I underline that word, only, available nesting habitat for the southern portion of zone 4. This area is situated in a key area close to the coast with no Federal lands in the immediate area that are able to provide similar recovery distributions. That is why I am offering my amendment today, to strike this provision. I wanted to emphasize to my colleagues that there are remedies here. If we want to get around the designation of critical habitat, I should not say get around, but if we want to deal with it, what we should do is what I have asked the companies in my State and in the Northwest and in Washington State to do, and that is to enter into a multispecies habitat conservation plan with the Fish and Wildlife Service. Through doing a multispecies habitat conservation plan, a person can achieve 100 years of certainty on his lands. Now, yes, there is a negotiation and certain areas have to be protected on these private lands, but that is the way to proceed. If one gets a multispecies habitat conservation plan, then they are entitled to an incidental take permit, so that if there is a take on private lands there will be no Federal sanction. The companies in the State of Washington are entering into these agreements. Now, if my friend from California can walk in here into the Congress and overturn a Federal court decision which directed that critical habitat be designated and get relief for his individual company, then how am I to ask all of my companies to do the right thing, and that is to negotiate a multispecies HCP with the Federal Government? So if we do this, the administration has stated in their letter to all of us up here on this bill that they will veto the bill. Last year we got ourselves into trouble by giving in to these substantive riders on this bill. So I urge my colleagues to support my amendment today to strike this out. It is the right thing to do for the ESA. It is the right thing, I think, to do for the private companies because then it will force Pacific Lumber Co., which has not negotiated in good faith with the Fish and Wildlife Service, to establish a habitat conservation plan; that they cannot come here and get around this provision. My judgment is that they should go back, sit down with the Fish and Wildlife Service, and do what Murray Pacific, Weyerhaeuser, Plum Creek, and the major companies in my part of the world are doing, and that is negotiating a multispecies habitat conservation plan. So let us defeat the Riggs amendment and stand behind the Endangered Species Act. I might say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, Mr. Speaker, that this will be one of the most important environmental votes of this Congress.","word.count":1178,"sep11":-5.36516853932584,"years":1996.49438202247,"days":532,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0398024566241522,"Topic 2":0.313303417968305,"Topic 3":0.00829592314465737,"Topic 4":0.0222611237203732,"Topic 5":0.380162524561609,"Topic 6":0.00165520747883696,"Topic 7":0.00141455848482424,"Topic 8":0.226197280569933,"Topic 9":0.00244527244869138,"Topic 10":0.00446223499861641},{"id":"10519970002694","body":"Joe Moakley: Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on the question of whether Puerto Rico will become our 51st State. Last year I was the only member of the Committee on Resources who voted against this bill on the final committee vote. I did not speak against this bill at the time or try to get anyone else to vote against it, primarily due to my great respect for and friendship with Chairman Young, the primary sponsor. Chairman Young and I agree on almost all issues, particularly on the need to open up a very small portion of Alaska to further oil production. After I cast this lone dissenting vote, I was asked to visit Puerto Rico by its government and some of its leading citizens, and in an attempt to be as fair as possible, I went there for a weekend visit 8 or 9 months ago. While there, I met some of the nicest people I have met anyplace in this world. I was greatly impressed with the beauty of the island and the great progress that is being made toward freedom and a strong economy and away from the shackles of socialism. I was impressed with the close ties and favorable feelings most Puerto Ricans have with and for the United States. I was told that Puerto Rico had sent more soldiers and sailors to the U.S. military than any other State per capita, and I really appreciate this. I had never thought much about this before I went there, but Puerto Rico is closer to Washington, D.C., and the Southeastern United States than are some of our Western States. I believe that Puerto Rico is fast on its way to becoming an island paradise. Some of it already is. Puerto Rico has a great future, if it continues moving even further toward a free market economy and lower taxes. The island is in a strategic location and could be a valuable asset to us militarily. However, in spite of all the many good things there are about Puerto Rico and its people, I do not believe Puerto Rico should become a State at this time. First and foremost to me, the American people do not support this expansion. In every poll or survey, the people of my district hold opinions almost identical to the national average. I have not received even one phone call, comment, letter or postcard in favor of this from my district. Every local contact has been against this. This is very important to me. Second, according to the Congressional Research Service, Tennessee would potentially be one of six or seven States to lose a House Member if Puerto Rico becomes a State. This would not have much effect on me because most of the growth in our State has been in and around Knoxville and Nashville, so my district will be about the same or even possibly shrink in size for the foreseeable future. However, it would definitely hurt our State if we lose the equivalent of 11 percent of our House delegation. Third, the GAO and others have estimated this could cost American taxpayers $3 to 5 billion a year in added costs to the Federal Government. We are not in nearly as strong a shape economically as some people think with the stock market at record levels. Also in about 8 to 10 years when the baby-boomers begin retiring, we are about to face some of the greatest costs we have ever seen in the history of this country. With national debt of $5.5 trillion right now and a debt almost quadruple that when you figure in future pension liabilities, we really cannot afford to do this until Puerto Rico strengthens its economy significantly. Fourth, when I went to Israel 3 or 4 years ago, our group met, among many others, with the woman who headed Israeli immigration. She told us they gave all immigrants to Israel up to 2 years of intensive language training if they needed it because Israel felt that it was very important to have a common, unifying national language. It is fine with me if everyone in this country learns Spanish or some other second language, but I think all U.S. citizens need to be truly, honestly fluent in English. We need a unifying national language. Look at the problems Canada has now with many in French-speaking Quebec wanting to split Canada in the middle. English is and should be our national language, even if some do not like it. I am told that a little over 20 percent of the people in Puerto Rico are fluent in English. I believe Puerto Rico should greatly emphasize the English language training if they want to become a part of our Union. Fifth and finally, some say only a little over half of Puerto Ricans want to become a State of the United States if they are given a truly free choice with fair definitions. I do not believe we should add any State unless an extremely high percentage, at least 75 percent or even more, want to become citizens. We certainly do not need to add a State where almost half of the people do not want it. Puerto Rico should vote first. They can hold a referendum without our permission. The Congress should not take a vote that as a practical matter we cannot get out of unless, and until we have a truly fair, accurate assessment of how many Puerto Ricans really want this. For all of these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I believe we should maintain our present friendly, close relationship with Puerto Rico as a U.S. Territory.","word.count":691,"sep11":-4.61797752808989,"years":1997.24157303371,"days":798,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.278417441583825,"Topic 2":0.0460358059880146,"Topic 3":0.0067811395896207,"Topic 4":0.0576323008635188,"Topic 5":0.00402916211539436,"Topic 6":0.00747458656320503,"Topic 7":0.0542438884608847,"Topic 8":0.0358666788604686,"Topic 9":0.504193786895866,"Topic 10":0.00532520907920142},{"id":"10419950144035","body":"Dianne Feinstein: Mr. President, our flag is recognized as unique, not only in the hearts and minds of Americans, but in our laws and customs as well. No other emblem or symbol in our Nation carries with it such a specific code of conduct and protocol in its display and handling. Here are just a few sections of the Federal law: Why then, should it be permissible conduct to urinate on, to defecate on, or to burn the flag? That is not my definition of free speech. Until the Supreme Court's decision in Texas versus Johnson in 1990, 48 of 50 States had laws preventing the burning or defacing of our Nation's flag. I do not take amending the Constitution lightly. However, when the Supreme Court issued the Johnson decision and then the Eichman decision, those who wanted to protect the flag were forced to find an alternative path. The Nation's flag is a revered object as well as a symbol. I believe that it should be viewed as such--as a revered national object, not simply as one of many vehicles for free speech. Everything about the flag in its tangible form, in its very fabric, has significance. The shape, the colors, the dimensions, and the arrangement of the patterns help make the flag what it is. The colors of the flag were chosen by the Continental Congress in the 18th century. In 1782, the Congress of the Confederation chose the same colors for the Great Seal of the United States: Red for hardiness and courage; white for purity and innocence; blue for vigilance, perseverance, and justice. If one were to change the colors, the orientation of the stripes, or the location of the field of stars, it would no longer be the American flag. What I am saying is that I believe that the physical integrity of the flag is crucial. Despite this fact, because the flag also has symbolic value, the Supreme Court has determined that physically burning or mutilating the flag does not destroy the symbol. Therefore, a prohibition on burning or mutilating the flag would not serve a ``compelling'' governmental interest and could not be justified under the first amendment. I do not agree. I believe that burning, tearing, and trampling on the object undermines the symbol. The process may be incremental, but over time the symbol erodes. The Supreme Court arguably has placed the flag in a kind of catch-22 situation. Because the flag is so important, because the flag is unique, because the flag has such powerful symbolic value, it, ironically, goes unprotected. I support Senate Joint Resolution 31 because it will return the Nation's flag to the protected status I believe it deserves. The authority for the Nation to protect its central symbol of unity was considered constitutional until 5 years ago. In the Senate Judiciary Committee's markup of Senate Joint Resolution 31, I proposed alternative legislation with more specific, narrowly tailored language. Although this was not voted on in committee, Chairman Hatch offered to work with me to see if we could develop language we could agree upon. He has now proposed the substitute amendment that I believe represents a vast improvement over the original language of Senate Joint Resolution 31. The original language would have allowed Congress, as well as each of the 50 States, to develop legislation prohibiting the desecration of the flag. In other words, each State would have been authorized to define ``flag,'' and each State would have been authorized to define ``desecration.'' The proposed substitute amendment offered earlier this afternoon would give Congress, and Congress alone, the authority to draft a statute to protect the flag. This will give Congress the opportunity to draft, carefully and deliberatively, precise statutory language that clearly defines the contours of prohibited conduct, something along the lines of the language I offered in committee. It would allow Congress to establish a uniform definition for ``flag of the United States,'' rather than allowing for 50 separate State definitions. Because we are protecting our national symbol, it makes sense to me that Members of Congress, representing the Nation as a whole, should craft the statute protecting our flag. Let me add that, from a first amendment perspective, a specific constitutional amendment prohibiting flag burning may be preferable to a statute. Harvard Law Prof. Frank Michelman made this point in a 1990 article, ``Saving Old Glory: On Constitutional Iconography.'' Although not himself an advocate of flag protective prohibitions, Professor Michelman argued that a specifically worded constitutional amendment related to flag burning could be preferable to a statute, posing fewer potential conflicts with the first amendment. An amendment pertaining exclusively to the flag would have little risk of affecting other kinds of expressive conduct. The premise of his argument is that, when the Constitution is amended, Supreme Court review is not required. By contrast, a statute, if challenged, could only survive if the Supreme Court ultimately determined it to be constitutional. In other words, the Court would need to justify that the statute conformed to existing freedom-of-expression doctrine. In so doing, the Court arguably would need to develop a rationale that could ultimately serve to justify prohibitions on other kinds of symbolic expression. So, I believe that those who say we are making a choice between trampling on the flag and trampling on the first amendment are creating an unfair dichotomy. Protecting the flag will not prevent people from expressing their ideas through other means, in the strongest possible terms. Furthermore, the right to free speech is not unrestricted. For example, the Government can prohibit speech that threatens to cause imminent tangible harm, including face-to-face ``fighting words,'' incitement to violation of law, or shouting ``fire'' in a crowded theater. Obscenity and false advertising are not protected under the first amendment, and indecency over the broadcast media can be limited to certain times of day. Ever since Justice Brennan's 1964 decision in New York Times versus Sullivan, statements criticizing official conduct of a public official may be sanctioned if they are known to be false and if they damage the reputation of the official. There is much that is open to debate about the proper parameters of free speech. In voting for this legislation, however, I extend a cautionary note. This amendment should not be viewed as a precedent for a host of new constitutional amendments on a limitless variety of subjects. The Constitution was designed to endure throughout the ages, and for that reason it should not be amended to accommodate the myriad of issues of the day. My support of a constitutional amendment to protect the flag reflects the gravity of my belief in the purpose. I recognize that by supporting a constitutional amendment to protect the flag, I am choosing a different course from many Democrats in Congress and, quite frankly, from many of my close friends for whom I have the greatest respect. But my support for this amendment reflects my broader belief that the time has come for the Nation to begin a major debate on values. I believe that this country must look at itself in the mirror and come to terms with those values. I do not wish to imply that one set of values is necessarily superior to another. But we cannot keep pressing the envelope and still remain a functional society. We need to ask ourselves what we hold dear--Is there anything we will not cast contempt upon? We need to ask ourselves: How can we foster respect for tradition as well as for ideological and cultural diversity? How can we foster community as well as individuality, nationhood as well as internationalism? These are all important values, and we have to learn to reconcile them. We must not jettison one at the expense of another. The Framers of the Constitution recognized two important elements of our constitutional tradition: a liberty element and a responsibility element. Without responsibility, without a rule of law, there could be no protection of life, limb, or property--there could be no lasting liberty. I believe there is a danger of moving too far in either direction--toward too restrictive order, or toward unlimited individual liberty. In this instance, I believe we cannot tilt the scales entirely in favor of individual rights, when there exists a vast community of people in this country who have gone to war for our flag. And there are mothers and fathers and wives and children who have received a knock at their front door and have been told that their son, or husband, or father had died alone, in a trench. They were given a flag on this occasion, a flag which helps preserve the memory of their loved one, and which speaks to his or her courage. Last June, the Senate Judiciary Committee heard testimony from Rose Lee of the Gold Star Wives of America, an organization representing 10,000 widows of American servicemen. This is what she said: Requiring certain individuals to refrain from defacing or burning the flag, I believe, is a small price to pay on behalf of the millions of Americans for whom the flag has deep personal significance. Just 5 years ago, when 48 States had laws against flag burning, the first amendment continued to thrive. I believe that this legislation will protect the integrity of the flag while keeping our first amendment jurisprudence intact. I urge my colleagues to support it. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.","word.count":1573,"sep11":-5.90168539325843,"years":1995.95786516854,"days":341,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0546173656974036,"Topic 2":0.118629133860367,"Topic 3":0.00876144459733351,"Topic 4":0.00433476069964525,"Topic 5":0.317760996822688,"Topic 6":0.0467329372962203,"Topic 7":0.00169850229724832,"Topic 8":0.322756019811329,"Topic 9":0.00366748001601596,"Topic 10":0.121041358901748},{"id":"10519970025154","body":"Frank Pallone: Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the Chair announces that he will reduce to a minimum of 5 minutes the period of time within which a vote by electronic device may be taken on each amendment on which the Chair has postponed further proceedings.","word.count":206,"sep11":-4.22752808988764,"years":1997.63202247191,"days":937,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.192916296247953,"Topic 2":0.193272349196368,"Topic 3":0.0539149980712338,"Topic 4":0.0696645711352633,"Topic 5":0.0279361178372478,"Topic 6":0.0023172297939112,"Topic 7":0.32693495689214,"Topic 8":0.0777579836489581,"Topic 9":0.0522081655846169,"Topic 10":0.0030773315923076},{"id":"10920050029888","body":"Wally Herger: Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX and the Chair's prior announcement, further proceedings on this question will be postponed.","word.count":127,"sep11":4.15449438202247,"years":2006.01404494382,"days":3921,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.6230115558357,"Topic 2":0.0892927428348022,"Topic 3":0.0359511199772847,"Topic 4":0.0646522627408798,"Topic 5":0.0248629742501088,"Topic 6":0.0433626865705472,"Topic 7":0.0188385163001616,"Topic 8":0.0591074922494392,"Topic 9":0.0287126785096798,"Topic 10":0.0122079707313973},{"id":"11020080029297","body":"Speaker: The Acting CHAIRMAN.

I want to express my condolences to the International Committee of the Red Cross and the families of the deceased. The ICRC staff were attacked as they returned from a project providing humanitarian relief to the civilian Burundian population. ICRC is the largest humanitarian organization in Burundi, providing water to over 200,000 people, as well as cans, pots, and blankets. The Red Cross agricultural programs keeps 150,000 people alive. Over the years, when I have traveled in Africa, I have always been impressed with the courageous work of the ICRC. From Somalia to Rwanda, Angola to Liberia, the ICRC performs critical functions--often, as we saw yesterday, at great personal risk. In many of these crises, I simply do not know what we would do with the ICRC. The International Red Cross has long been identified as a neutral organization which meticulously avoids taking sides in armed conflicts. For that reason, the brutal attack on the relief officials--in a vehicle clearly marked with Red Cross emblems--is particularly outrageous. Mr. President, while much of the rest of the world--and even most of Africa--is moving forward into the 21st century, some countries continue to deteriorate into almost medieval levels of brutality with a total disregard for human life. Over the past year, the violence in Burundi has increased dramatically as both the Burundian military and rebels based in Zaire have killed civilians at will. While the extremists pursue a strategy of intimidation, the civilians of Burundi suffer. In recent months, thousands of innocent people have been killed. Tens of thousands have been displaced from their homes, many forced into Zaire and Tanzania. As the level of violence grows, Burundi risks spiraling totally out of control into a cycle of genocidal brutality. Mr. President, it is difficult to know what to do in this type of situation. Clearly, as security permits, we will support humanitarian relief operations. The United States and our Europeans allies will continue to engage in active diplomatic efforts to stop the killing. I commend the administration, particularly National Security Adviser Tony Lake, for taking a trip to Burundi to signal high-level concern. And the United Nations is exploring a numbers of options to address the continued violence. But I believe the primary responsibility--and the most effective means--to stop the killing lies with those on the African Continent. First and foremost, the Burundians themselves must stand up and say that enough is enough. The military--the primary perpetrators of the violence--must end the brutality and perform as a neutral, professional force protecting, not killing, their citizens. The Hutu rebels based in Zaire must stop their campaign of terror. All parties must stop spreading fear and pursue their goals through dialog. Mr. President, the neighboring states--those most affected by the insecurity in Burundi--must play an active role in reestablishing stability in the region. Former President Nyerere of Tanzania is leading an active diplomatic initiative to bring the Burundian parties together. I commend President Nyerere for his efforts, and the United States should continue to strongly support him. I would urge the Organization of African Unity to become more engaged in Burundi. The Secretary General of the OAU has issued a statement on Burundi. But the OAU, in order to be relevant, must stop talking about ending conflict and begin to take actions to stop conflicts. Finally, as the primary host to refugees from Rwanda and Burundi, Zaire has a clear interest in promoting peace in Burundi. Yet, all evidence points to the continued destabilizing role of Zaire in central Africa. President Mobutu and Prime Muinister Kengo must use their influence to stop the arms trafficking to the Hutu rebels based in Zaire. They must arrest the intimidators spreading fear among refugees. And they must improve security on the border. Over the years, I have been one of the first to criticize President Mobutu for his human rights and economic policies in Zaire. He has destroyed the physical and social infrastructure of his country, potentially one of Africa's richest and most powerful. Now he is feeding instability in Burundi and Rwanda despite the interests of the Zairian people in stability. President Mobutu should understand that his role in central Africa will be noted and remembered by the United States. Mr. President, once again I want to express my deep sadness over the brutal murder of the three International Committee of the Red Cross relief workers in Burundi. They died in a noble cause: helping innocent civilians stay alive. It is my hope that their deaths will be among the last in Burundi--and not just one more tragic event in the continued slide into uncontrollable ethnic brutality.","word.count":328,"sep11":-5.98033707865169,"years":1995.87921348315,"days":313,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0132390206399833,"Topic 2":0.00936773107653834,"Topic 3":0.00716022926736974,"Topic 4":0.00363614872594573,"Topic 5":0.00417103789180446,"Topic 6":0.627899913644885,"Topic 7":0.00359050691194852,"Topic 8":0.240160218796884,"Topic 9":0.0708744989072806,"Topic 10":0.0199006941373598},{"id":"10619990048544","body":"Russell Feingold: Without objection, it is so ordered","word.count":454,"sep11":-2.57584269662921,"years":1999.28370786517,"days":1525,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.121427863360152,"Topic 2":0.349825285913078,"Topic 3":0.0207781545778587,"Topic 4":0.0544845553142164,"Topic 5":0.0268582199044803,"Topic 6":0.0387901246574135,"Topic 7":0.241601280611492,"Topic 8":0.078105377210379,"Topic 9":0.015488627841864,"Topic 10":0.0526405106090648},{"id":"10820040013485","body":"Edward Markey: Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me time.

When single moms in Orlando, Florida are paying $80 to fill up their minivans, this is a crisis. I spent my time in August touring the northern slope of Alaska to learn more about the oil drilling situation as well as touring the Florida Solar Energy Center in Central Florida where they have the cutting-edge solar energy technology of tomorrow. The straight talk is we need a comprehensive approach to address this energy crisis. We need more drilling here in America, in both Alaska and offshore. We need more renewable energy like wind and solar. We need more conservation like hybrids and higher fuel efficiency standards for our cars. We need all of the above. That is why I am proud to be the cosponsor of the American Energy Act. It's also why the American people deserve an up-or-down vote in this Congress on the American Energy Act. Now, those who say ``no'' to drilling completely ignore the facts. The main component of a price of gasoline is crude oil. Crude oil is a commodity governed by the law of supply and demand. Therefore, we must increase our supply of crude oil and reduce our demand. Well, where is the largest untapped source of crude oil in America? It's in Alaska, in a place called ANWR. The critics say three things: Don't let us drill in ANWR because it's only a trivial amount of oil. It will ruin the pristine wilderness, and it will hurt the wildlife in that area, particularly the caribou and the polar bears. I went there on a factfinding mission to find out the answers to those questions myself. Let's address each one. Is it a trivial amount of oil? I learned from our independent experts and employees of the U.S. Department of the Interior that there are 10.4 billion barrels of crude oil under the lands in ANWR. 10.4 billion barrels of oil are enough to provide all of my home State of Florida with its energy needs for 29 years. 10.4 billion barrels of oil are enough to pump 1 million barrels of oil a day every single day for the next 30 years. Does that sound like a trivial amount of oil to you? The next thing I heard is it will ruin the pristine wilderness area. Well, I stood right here in the only village in ANWR called Kaktovik, and I looked south from the Arctic Ocean, and I didn't see any trees. It's a flat, frozen, barren tundra. It's 30 degrees in the middle of August, and it's 30 below in the winter. I sat there with the head leader from the Eskimo tribe, Mr. Fenton Rexford, and I said, ``Where are the trees?'' He says, ``Well, Congressman, there's not a tree within 100 miles of where the drilling would take place.'' So much for the pristine wilderness we hear about. The next thing we hear is that we'll hurt wildlife. I learned from our fish and wildlife experts that, in reality, there are over 5,000 polar bears in Alaska and 800,000 caribou, and their numbers have increased every year for the past 30 years. In fact, in the current largest oil field in America, Prudhoe Bay, they started drilling in the mid-1970s. At the time, there were 3,000 caribou there. Now caribou have increased tenfold in Prudhoe Bay, and there are over 30,000 caribou there. I saw them peacefully coexisting. So, when you take away their real arguments and you see it firsthand that you can drill for oil and that you can do it in an environmentally friendly manner, what is the bottom line for why some of these environmental extremists don't want us to drill? Well, we don't have to guess. This is what the president of the Sierra Club says. His name is Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club: ``We are better off without cheap gas.'' They don't want gas prices to go down. Tell the single mom in Orlando who just paid 80 bucks to fill up her minivan that she is better off without cheap gas. Tell the thousands of airline employees who just lost their jobs because of skyrocketing fuel that they're better off without cheap gas. Tell the people in Orlando, Florida who are losing their jobs in the tourism industry because tourism is down that they're better off without cheap gas. Tell the small businessman who has just had to lay off his employees because he can't make the payroll anymore because of gasoline prices that he's better off without cheap gas. Tell the school districts that are having to go to 4-day-a-week school because they can't afford the gas for their buses that they're better off without cheap gas. Let's bring some sanity back into this program. Let's have a vote, up or down, on the American Energy Act. Let's have it right now, this month, before we adjourn.","word.count":833,"sep11":7.17696629213483,"years":2009.03651685393,"days":4997,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.221695860923758,"Topic 2":0.135045336454385,"Topic 3":0.0265439724818896,"Topic 4":0.0260111261127675,"Topic 5":0.0162154673587729,"Topic 6":0.0076266464477137,"Topic 7":0.00642492933111388,"Topic 8":0.333634655372957,"Topic 9":0.0495648460194144,"Topic 10":0.177237159497228},{"id":"10519980015066","body":"Eva Clayton: Mr. Speaker, this rule is, indeed, unfortunate, because agricultural research provided for in the committee bill is much needed, for a variety of reasons.

Now that they will be naming this courthouse after Jimmy Quillen, Mr. Speaker, I think that every single building, medical school, and road in eastern Tennessee should be named after Jimmy Quillen. Mr. Speaker, that is the way it should be. I served with Jimmy in the House Committee on Rules for over 21 years, and I can tell my colleagues from first-hand experience that he deserves every accolade that comes his way. Jimmy joined the Committee on Rules back in 1965 with another dear friend of mine, Claude Pepper, and he served until 1996, at which point he became the longest-serving Republican on the House Committee on Rules. He also served in Congress longer than any other representative from Tennessee, some 34 years. Jimmy Quillen rose from a humble background to serve in the Navy in World War II. He served the Tennessee State House, where he became the minority leader. In 1963, he went on to represent the first district of Tennessee in the United States Congress. Jimmy believed in old-fashioned, constituent-oriented representation. To prove his point, Jimmy even took his office door off its hinges to represent his open-door policy, and that open door served as an inspiration for many of us who followed him. Jimmy was a true Southern gentlemen whose word was his bond. I can remember in the 1980's when we were working on the S&amp;L bailout and someone proposed eliminating some of the benefits that were promised to the people who bought these failing S&amp;L's and Jimmy Quillen stood up and fought that amendment tooth and nail, saying, ``a deal is a deal.'' And, Mr. Speaker, he was right. But every time after that we would look at Jimmy and say, ``a deal is a deal.'' What was important to Jimmy was comity and good faith above all else. He was a distinguished, hard-working, kind member of the Committee on Rules and a very worthy adversary. Every once in a while, I catch myself looking for Jimmy in the second seat in the second row on the House floor. He is sorely missed here in the Congress.

We are going to increase the limit on how deep this government can go into debt. Every year we spend more tax dollars and we add more government services, and my concern is that too many Americans are becoming too dependent on government. By the next election, this fall, a majority of Americans will be dependent on Federal Government for their health, their education, their income, or their retirement benefits. Some suggest that as many as 60 percent of households receive more than $10,000 a year from government in the form of retirement, health care, welfare or other benefits. At the same time, Mr. Speaker, the number of taxpayers paying for these benefits is rapidly shrinking. The question is, how well can any free nation survive when a majority of its citizens heavily dependent on government services no longer have the incentive to restrain the growth of government? As we all know, over the last 50 years, American attitudes have been shifting from cherishing self-sufficiency and personal responsibility to wanting a little more security from the Federal Government to assure them of a certain number of benefits. Government benefits, once concentrated on the needy, now extend into the middle and upper-middle class households, even as more and more Americans see their income tax liabilities decrease. Today, the majority of Americans can vote themselves more generous government benefits at little or no cost to themselves. As a result, they have really little incentive to restrain the continued growth of big government and the benefits big government dangles before them. Fifty percent of Americans now pay less than 4 percent of the total individual income taxes, while the top 5 percent pay nearly 55 percent of the individual income taxes. At the same time, the folks who are paying the least for government are receiving the most benefits. Americans who receive nearly half of the Federal Government benefits pay only, listen to this, Mr. Speaker, pay only 1 percent of the individual income taxes. Many of these beneficiaries are poor, but an increasing number are middle-class retirees who enjoy extra income and health care through Social Security and Medicare. This is help we say from government, but it is from the other taxpayers of this country. Our founders created a system where taxes are the price for government benefits and services. The idea is that voters would restrain the growth and expansion of government because of the personal costs to themselves in taxes. Our founders built into the original Constitution a provision that prohibited taxes based on income because they wanted people to achieve. That was the motivation. This provision, however, was amended by the 16th amendment. As a result, a near majority of voters now pay little or no income taxes while they receive an increasing number of government benefits. The extreme progressiveness of our Tax Code has reduced, and in some cases eliminated, any cost of government for a growing number of voters. At the same time, many of these voters are dependent on government for much of their income, their health care, and other government services. It is like handing someone a menu at a restaurant and saying this bill is already paid for, and then asking them to make an order. I think it is a difficult offer to refuse, and it is the same way with government. Limited government is ultimately essential to our economy's strength and freedom. The success of the United States is built on the free enterprise motivation that those who learn, work hard, and save are better off than those who do not. As that becomes less true with bigger and more intrusive government, we not only diminish that motivation, we lose more of our personal liberty and freedom. This is a growing threat to our way of life, and we can no longer ignore the kind of influence that it generates.","word.count":659,"sep11":0.530898876404494,"years":2002.3904494382,"days":2631,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.746514949327888,"Topic 2":0.0844070894213396,"Topic 3":0.0183637780457605,"Topic 4":0.0390154274246368,"Topic 5":0.0187238754093806,"Topic 6":0.0175150798849644,"Topic 7":0.0146157205104219,"Topic 8":0.0319025652509988,"Topic 9":0.0203689196321107,"Topic 10":0.00857259509249873},{"id":"10619990070919","body":"Chuck Robb: I yield my 5 remaining minutes to the Senator from North Carolina.

My colleague from Arizona, who will speak in opposition to this resolution of disapproval, is here to make a presentation and my colleague with whom I have worked on this resolution of disapproval, Senator Lott from Mississippi, is here and will make a statement. I believe others will arrive as well. Let me describe what we are doing. There is a provision in Federal law that allows the Congress to effectively veto a rule offered by a Federal agency under certain circumstances. This is called the Congressional Review Act. I call it a legislative veto. It is rarely used. In fact, this is only the second occasion on which it will be used. It requires 35 signatures of Senators to discharge a proposition from a committee and bring it to the Senate floor, with 10 hours of debate. Following the 10 hours of debate, there is then a vote on the resolution of disapproval. The specific rule that brings us to the floor today with a resolution of disapproval is a rule by the Federal Communications Commission dealing with broadcast ownership rules. This is an issue that is controversial. It is highly charged and very significant. Some Members believe very strongly that what the Federal Communications Commission has done is horribly wrong for the interests of this country. I said at the Commerce Committee when we discussed this, especially in the aftermath of the FCC making and announcing its rules, never have I seen a Federal agency that is supposed to be a regulatory agency cave in so quickly and so completely to the large economic interests. That is exactly what I think has happened. It has happened at the expense of the public interest. The foundation of our democracy is information. The free flow of information is what nourishes and refreshes this democracy of ours. When what the American people see, hear, and read is controlled by fewer and fewer interests, in my judgment, it is detrimental to this government and to our country. The ruling by the Federal Communications Commission says, among other things, this will be just fine in the future; in America's largest cities, one single company can own the dominant newspaper, the dominant television station, and two other television stations, eight radio stations, and the cable company in that same town. It is just fine. And they can do it in that town and another town and another town and another town, and that is just fine, according to the FCC rule. Pardon my expression, but I think that is absolutely nuts. It is not fine--not fine with me, not fine with a good many of my colleagues. What we design to do is to pass a resolution of disapproval in the Senate to say to the Federal Communications Commission: Do it over, and do it right. The Federal Communications Commission held only one public hearing before embarking on the largest rule change in the history of this country with respect to ownership of broadcast properties. Having held only one hearing, they then said: Well, let's do this Katie-bar-the- door approach to allowing the additional concentration and this new orgy of mergers that almost certainly will occur as a result of this rule. They said: Let's allow newspapers to own television stations in the same town, have the same television stations and radio stations marry up. We know what has happened since the 1996 act. Ownership rules have changed; we have seen galloping concentrations. One company in this country now owns nearly 1,300 radio stations. In one city in North Dakota, we have eight radio stations. One of them is a religious station, one is a public broadcast station, and six are commercial stations. All six are owned by the same company. I ask my colleagues, does anyone think there is a public outcry in this country for the need to have more concentration in broadcast ownership? Has anyone heard that public outcry? I have not. The airwaves in this country belong to the American people. They do not belong to the broadcast companies. They do not belong to a television or radio company. They belong to the American people. We license them for use by companies that want to send a television or radio signal and we say that, attendant to that use, you have certain responsibilities and obligations: Competition, diversity, and localism. What does localism mean? It means we anticipate that when you have a property to broadcast radio or television signals in your local community, you have a responsibility to that community to broadcast some of those local basketball games, talk to the people in the community about the local charity event this weekend, tell them about what is happening on Main Street. That is localism. What do we have these days? All too often we have the concentration that has developed in all broadcast media. Now we have something instead of localism; it is called voice tracking. Do you know what voice tracking is? With this massive amount of mergers, with one company owning many stations, voice tracking is that which occurs when you drive down the street in Salt Lake City, UT, and turn on your dial on the radio station and hear someone saying, ``It is sunny out here in Salt Lake City this morning,'' and that person may be in a basement in Baltimore, MD, broadcasting from a broadcast booth. Do you know what that is called? Voice tracking; ripping a sheet off the printer from the Internet that shows the sun is shining in Salt Lake City so they can pretend they are broadcasting from Salt Lake City, UT, from a Salt Lake City station, when in fact they are not 1,000 miles near Salt Lake City, they are halfway across the country pretending there is some local element to that radio station. That is not moving in the public interest. As we engage in this debate, I want someone to tell me that localism is old fashioned. I want someone to tell me that what I consider to be a transcendent truth about the value of requiring localism in exchange for being able to use the airwaves with a radio or television license is somehow an old-fashioned value. For me, it is not. There is so much to say about all of this, and I will speak at great length, but I have a chart that shows where we are with respect to these broadcast properties these days. I will not attempt to tell you about all of this, but the News Corporation, of course, is Fox and Rupert Murdoch; Clear Channel; Viacom; Disney; AOL/Time Warner. Let me use Disney as an example: Ten television stations, including in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Houston, Raleigh, Fresno, Flint, Toledo; 53 radio stations. The ABC Network, Disney Channel, ESPN, A&amp;E, SoapNet, History Channel, Lifetime, Disney Pictures, Touchstone, Hollywood, Caravan, Miramax. It goes on and on and on. People say: What is the big deal here? We have so many more outlets in which you can get information. We now have the Internet. We didn't used to have that. You have so many different outlets. Do you know something. Go to your cable system and find out who owns the major channels. The same people. Go to the Internet and find out who owns the top sites on the Internet. The same people. So you have many different voices; yes, from the same ventriloquist. Many voices, one ventriloquist or two or three or four--at least fewer ventriloquists in terms of what the American people see, hear, and read. I do not accuse the Federal Communications Commission of bad faith. I happen to like the Federal Communications Commissioners. I believe I know all of them personally. The chairman is someone I have had lunch with a couple times. I like him a lot. I just think they have made a horrible mistake, and I think they did it without the due diligence that is required of those in a regulatory commission position. We expect them to be the referees of sorts. We expect them to wear the striped shirts with the whistles that say: We are here to call the fouls. We are here on behalf of the public interest to call the game. The fact is, this regulatory agency did exactly what the big economic interests and the broadcasting industry wanted. And they did it cleanly and quickly, with minimum nuisance of public participation. There was only one hearing in Richmond, VA. Well, they did get three-quarters of a million pieces of mail and communications over the Internet saying: Don't do this. It is against the public interest. But it did not matter to the FCC. They did it anyway. As a result, I hope this Senate will send a message to the Federal Communications Commission: This rule is a bad rule. This rule opens the gates to massive additional concentration, mergers, and acquisition to fewer and fewer companies owning more and more properties, at least in the circumstance with respect to broadcasts and newspapers. And, by the way, they also eliminate the ban on cross ownership. At least in this circumstance, we don't think it is in the public interest. That is what I hope the Senate will tell the Federal Communications Commission today. By this vote, it will be the first step--a big step--in a process of saying to the Federal Communications Commission: We in Congress veto this rule. You must go back and do it again. Do it over and do it right. Mr. President, I have a lot to say today, and I know my colleagues do as well. But I think in the interest of time, having described why we are here, and the origin of this effort, I will yield the floor. My colleagues from Arizona and Mississippi want to make presentations, following which I will again then amplify my remarks. I yield the floor.","word.count":1687,"sep11":2.05056179775281,"years":2003.91011235955,"days":3172,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.373004424109125,"Topic 2":0.425938974320996,"Topic 3":0.0107065337650163,"Topic 4":0.0228124170913639,"Topic 5":0.0841332804685646,"Topic 6":0.00616623831879962,"Topic 7":0.0127387155794475,"Topic 8":0.0153913669039443,"Topic 9":0.0273055323586321,"Topic 10":0.0218025170841108},{"id":"11020080005809","body":"Speaker: Pursuant to House Resolution 1036 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the concurrent resolution, H.

Mr. Chairman, as chair of the Terrorism, Human Intelligence, Analysis and Counterintelligence Subcommittee, I have been directed to ensure that the intelligence community has the resources necessary to complete the thousands upon thousands of intelligence operations conducted each year in direct support of our Nation's diplomatic and military efforts worldwide, all during a time of war. Although the risks involved in intelligence operations are inherently high, they are significantly greater when conducted against blood- thirsty insurgents and radical extremists, both of which accept that the mass murder of innocent men, women and children is justifiable. When faced with an enemy that is so brutal and remorseless, we must ensure that the intelligence community has the personnel and the operational tools needed to collect, analyze, and disseminate the type of intelligence that allows us to disrupt the activities of such an enemy. H.R. 5020 does this as it provides the resources needed to increase human intelligence operations, enhance analytical capabilities, and sustain intelligence collection platforms. Insightful, accurate and timely intelligence has always been the key to understanding the plans and intentions of our adversaries. It is not a secret that some of these adversaries have little respect for human rights or the internationally accepted rule of law. They are determined to destroy growing democracies and strip their citizens of the liberties we as Americans often take for granted. They are committed to bringing the war back to the homeland, where our families and friends might be subjected to similar horrors as were experienced on 9/11. We cannot and we will not let this happen. We cannot appear irresolute in our goal to ensure our political and military leaders have the best intelligence possible while we are waging this war. It is our duty to ensure that the Nation is protected, and H.R. 5020 strives to guarantee that the right type of intelligence is provided to our leaders so that they may protect our Nation. It is also our duty to provide resources to improve the ability of our servicemembers and intelligence officers as they confront terrorism worldwide and combat insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan. Authorizing any amount less than the full funding requested for the global war on terrorism or operations in Iraq would place members of our armed services and our intelligence community under greater peril than they are today. Not authorizing the full amount would be tantamount to compromising our national security. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and, once again, I congratulate my chairman on his outstanding effort.","word.count":464,"sep11":4.74157303370786,"years":2006.60112359551,"days":4130,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0111381594119413,"Topic 2":0.506129548838508,"Topic 3":0.00773196071084975,"Topic 4":0.00293585402589004,"Topic 5":0.00706044148911866,"Topic 6":0.429569666904129,"Topic 7":0.00541705648936905,"Topic 8":0.00841895423932301,"Topic 9":0.0195611942329962,"Topic 10":0.00203716365787534},{"id":"10920060010481","body":"Marsha Blackburn: Mr. Speaker, the topic of this week, the topic of discussion with our constituents, with those who are calling us is illegal immigration and their concern over Mexico's choosing and wanting to sue the United States for defending our borders.

Mr. Chairman, the concern I have about this amendment is the way it is drawn and the actual application when it is out in the schools. This amendment, I think, could create a violation of the Constitution, specifically the 5th and 14th amendments, and the equal protection. I think it sets up a good equal protection argument, that it gives the States the ability to decide, whether it is in Texas or California, New Mexico or Arizona. It think we would see that come back to the Supreme Court, and they would probably rule the same way they did on an earlier Texas case. The amendment would give the power of Congress to the States to decide whether they could deny that education to the children of illegals. Mr. Chairman, the other concern I have is the procedure in the amendment. Again, I am trying to bring what we do on the floor down into what is going to happen into the Houston Independent School District, or the Alvin District, or any of the districts in the country. A child may be a citizen, but their parents may be illegal. What is the procedure in this amendment to the affidavit that is going to be signed? Are the parents going to sign? That that child is entitled to an education because that child is a citizen, even though the parents may not be here legally. I think there are so many questions about this amendment that cause us concern. It would place an enormous burden on our educational system. Mr. Chairman, we want teachers to be teaching. We want to take away some of the paperwork that is being required, not just by Federal law, but by State and local rules, and we want teachers to be teaching. What this amendment sets up is that our teachers would be doing more administrative work than they should be.

In my district in western Pennsylvania, most working families and retirees depend on Social Security as the keystone of their retirement security. These families are clearly at risk because of the grim shadow of looming bankruptcy that has fallen on Social Security, casting doubt on its long-term viability. The collapse of Social Security is not immediate, but it is inevitable without major changes in the program, changes that will become more draconian the longer they are postponed. We in Congress have a fundamental responsibility to move quickly and decisively, free of cant and partisanship, to place Social Security on a sound financial footing. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3546, legislation to establish a national dialogue on Social Security and a bipartisan panel to design long-term Social Security reform. Under this legislation, a national dialogue would be convened to engage the American public through regional conferences and through national internet exchanges in understanding the current program, the problems it faces and the need to find solutions that will be workable for all generations. In addition, a bipartisan panel would be created to design a single package of long-range Social Security reforms to restore the solvency of the system and maintain retirement income security. The process of Social Security reform created in this bill is the best hope to yield, through engagement of the American public, a solution which restores the long-term viability of the Social Security retirement system in a manner beneficial to every generation and every class. I urge my colleagues to pass this bill as the first step on the path of fulfilling our obligation as trustees and custodians of a system that has literally transformed the face of poverty among older Americans.","word.count":299,"sep11":-3.45786516853933,"years":1998.40168539326,"days":1211,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0689947677654262,"Topic 2":0.103593470469911,"Topic 3":0.330903418310062,"Topic 4":0.216766931174232,"Topic 5":0.017233948546751,"Topic 6":0.249873073993642,"Topic 7":0.00188660405761078,"Topic 8":0.00631475275982818,"Topic 9":0.00272841274081975,"Topic 10":0.0017046201817169},{"id":"10519980012032","body":"Floyd Spence: Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from Vermont made reference to getting our priorities straight. What is a higher priority than defending the lives of all the people of this great country? We are talking about cutting today. I would like to remind the gentleman that the defense budget, which includes the intelligence budget, has taken all the cuts in recent years. Spending has gone up for everything else except defense. Let me dwell on that for a minute. I do not think people realize the extent to which we have cut back on our military and our intelligence- gathering agencies, the impact these cuts have had on our national defense. And yes, in a world where the Cold War is over, but in many ways a more dangerous world today than it was during the Cold War. And I will tell my colleagues why. Because people do not realize what we have done to ourselves. We have done to our military and to our intelligence agencies what no foreign power has been able to do. We have been decimating our own defenses. That is unforgivable, Mr. Chairman. In this dangerous world in which we are living, when not tomorrow but tonight, today, at any minute, this whole world could explode for us. It is just that serious. And here we are fat, dumb, and happy going about our merry ways, not concerned about what could happen to us. Let me tell my colleagues what could happen to us. In this day and time you do not have to be a superpower to raise the horrors of mass destruction warfare on people. It could be a Third World country, a rogue nation, or a terrorist group for that matter. They can put together weapons of mass destruction in laboratories in inexpensive low-tech ways. They can marry these weapons of mass destruction with cruise missiles, which can be bought across borders. They can launch them from various platforms, airplanes, submarines, ships, tugboats, extending the range to the extent that it brings everyone under the threat of weapons of mass destruction. These weapons of mass destruction are chemical, biological, bacteriological. Can my colleagues imagine having to defend against these kinds of weapons, hideous weapons? Anthrax could be released in the air over Washington, D.C. in a simple way, killing hundreds of thousands of people, and we could not inoculate people fast enough to prevent anything happening to them. That could happen at any time and people are talking about cutting back on our ability to defend against these things or to prevent them from happening. It is unconscionable to even think about it. It borders on leaving our country defenseless when confronting the enemy and all the dangers that we are facing as a country. Aside from those weapons of mass destruction, we face all kinds of threats from various sources. This is a very dangerous world. We have to do more instead of less in defending our country and our people. Mr. Chairman, I would urge my colleagues to let reason come to this debate. Think it through.

Then I see there are other Senators seeking recognition. I will not delay them long. This is a very important amendment on which I will request we actually have a rollcall vote tomorrow. It is an amendment to invest an additional $60 million in eight different programs, in a combination of eight different programs. They are very important to the Hispanic community in this country. The eight programs are migrant education, English language acquisition programs, the High School Equivalency Program, the College Assistance Migrant Program, Dropout Prevention, English as a Second Language Programs, local family information centers, and the Hispanic-Serving Institutions Program. The amendment is strongly supported by the Hispanic Education Coalition, which is an ad hoc coalition of national organizations dedicated to improving educational opportunities for more than 40 million Hispanics living in the United States, including groups such as the National Council of La Raza, HACU, and MALDEF. The National PTA is also a very strong supporter of the amendment. The Title I Migrant Education Program was established to provide a compensatory education program designed to deal with the difficulties encountered by children of migrant workers as a consequence of their mobility. Some of these children attend three or four schools in a single school year. They have a great need for coordination of educational services among the States and local districts where they live, often for short periods of time. The MEP builds the support structures for migrant students so that they can achieve high levels of success both in and outside of school. The U.S. Department of Education reports that more than 750,000 students were identified as eligible for the program in fiscal year 2001. Additional funds are necessary to ensure that these children are able to meet the challenges mandated by the No Child Left Behind Act. This amendment will provide an additional $9.6 million in needed funding. This amendment would also increase funding to States and local school districts in order to ensure that as many of the 5.5 million children with limited English skills as possible learn English, develop high levels of academic attainment, and meet the same challenging State academic standards as all children. Title III is a formula grant program that distributes funding to all 50 States based on the number of limited English proficient, LEP, and recent immigrant students. The funds are used for developing effective language acquisition programs; training for bilingual/ESL teachers and regular teachers and educational personnel; parent involvement; and providing services for recently arrived immigrant students. This amendment requests an additional $10.3 million for Language Acquisition Grants, which restores the program's funding to its fiscal year 2003 level. This amendment would provide modest increases for the High School Equivalency Program, HEP, and the College Assistance Migrant Program, CAMP. The HEP helps migrant students who have dropped out of high school earn a GED. The CAMP assists migrant students in their first year of college with both counseling and stipends. These programs provide farmworker migrant students with education opportunities and support that will help them to become productive members of society. Migrant students are among the most disadvantaged youth in this Nation. Current estimates place the dropout rate for migrant youth at between 50 and 60 percent. Before CAMP, there was no record of a child of migrant farm workers ever having attended college. Both programs have been very successful in helping migrant students become productive members of society. According to the Department of Education, in 2003-2004, almost 10,000 students were served by HEP CAMP, and 63 percent of the HEP participants received a GED, and 84 percent of CAMP students completed their first year of college in good standing. This amendment provides an additional $5.7 million for these programs. The Dropout Prevention program helps States and school districts to implement research-based, sustainable, and coordinated school dropout prevention and re-entry programs in order to raise student achievement. At a time when schools are focused on narrowing achievement gaps between differing subgroups of students, it seems that Congress would want to retain Dropout Prevention, a program specifically aimed at providing schools with the tools to help students achieve a high school degree. Support for Dropout Prevention is even more significant when considering that the primary source of Federal funding for public schools, authorized through the No Child Left Behind Act, NCLB, focuses mainly on elementary schools. More than 90 percent of Tit1e I funds-- the principal NCLB program--are directed to elementary schools. Such an emphasis on elementary education is necessary and appropriate, but equally important is continuing an investment of resources throughout the education continuum in order to meet the needs of middle level and high school students. The Dropout Prevention program is the only Federal program actively working to reduce the Nation's dropout rates, and, as recent headlines tell us, it is a problem that is far more severe than previous data indicated. A report by the Urban Institute finds that only 68 percent of all students in the public high school class of 2001 graduated. Furthermore, it states that only 50 percent of all black students and 53 percent of Hispanic students graduate. Nearly half of all black and Hispanic students do not graduate from high school. This is a problem that has reached enormous proportions. The Dropout Prevention program was eliminated in this legislation. This amendment restores $5 million to this program. The Local Family Information Centers program was authorized under the No Child Left Behind Act to provide parents of Title I students, including English language learners, with information about their children's schools so that they can help their children to meet the high standards we have set under NCLB. The Local Family Information Centers also help parents to hold their local and State school officials accountable and become more involved in their children's education. This amendment would increase funding for these centers by $13 million. The need for increased funding for English as a Second Language, ESL, is evident by the growing demand for services and the lack of resources to meet that need. Enrollment in Adult ESL has increased 105 percent over the past 10 years, yet there is a lack of programs and funding to ensure that all who desire to learn English have access to appropriate services. Currently, community-based organizations must piece programs together with volunteer labor and facilities. The need for more targeted services is overwhelming. Demand for English-language instruction far outweighs supply, waiting lists for classes typically range from several months to years, and many States do not have the capacity to meet the demand. The current $70 million in funding is insufficient to meet the enormous demand for ESL services. As the labor market continues to require English-proficient labor, investing in ESL programs will strengthen the labor pool and return a more versatile productive workforce. This amendment provides an additional $6.5 million for ESL programs. Currently, 35 percent of Hispanics are under the age of 18. The Educational Testing Service has projected the U.S. higher education system will grow by 3.5 million additional students by 2015 and that nearly 40 percent of these new students will be Hispanic. HSIs serve the largest concentrations of the Nation' s youngest and largest ethnic population. The impending emergence of more than 100 new HSIs, mostly in California, Texas, Florida, New Mexico and Illinois, in the next few years and the rapid growth of the Hispanic college-age population underscore the urgency for immediate, major, and sustained increases in Title V funding. At a time when the current labor force is reaching retirement age in substantial numbers, Hispanics already represent one of every three new workers joining the U.S. labor force, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. By 2025, the Bureau projects that one of two new workers joining the U.S. labor force will be Hispanic. This amendment would provide an additional $9.9 million in assistance to these great institutions. We must do everything possible to provide every child with the best education we can. This amendment would provide small, but much-needed increases to programs that can make a difference in the lives of millions of children. I urge my fellow Senators to support these greatly needed programs by providing them with the proper resources. I will seek some additional time tomorrow before we actually have a vote on this amendment in order to further explain to my colleagues the reasons this amendment needs to be adopted. I yield the floor.","word.count":1424,"sep11":4.23033707865169,"years":2006.08988764045,"days":3948,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.00831586289694877,"Topic 2":0.10461752761755,"Topic 3":0.00804799138995934,"Topic 4":0.00721887087569884,"Topic 5":0.0295035655870601,"Topic 6":0.0301086583102943,"Topic 7":0.111662249848447,"Topic 8":0.0229256286931919,"Topic 9":0.612468675937086,"Topic 10":0.065130968843763},{"id":"10720020010767","body":"Speaker: OBEY. Mr. Chairman, we have heard a lot today about the need to pass this bill in order to support our troops in the field, and we have heard a lot about how we need to be tough in fighting terrorism. This amendment is the first of two amendments that I will try to offer, one to this section, the FBI, and another to the Department of Defense budget, which will do the following: With respect to the FBI, in January, the FBI argued for additional funds for several critical activities to upgrade the security of their new computer system and to make certain that it is backed up and protected against loss in the event of terrorist attack. The FBI also asked for funds to increase their access to foreign language translators and analysts, because the FBI and other intelligence agencies have huge amounts of paper lying around which they want to sift through for intelligence information but they cannot because they do not have the translators. What this amendment does with respect to that item is to eliminate the line-item veto which this bill presently contains for the President. There is a clause on line 12 of page 6 which indicates that all of the amounts that we are appropriating to the FBI cannot be spent unless the President designates them all as an emergency. What we are trying to do is to eliminate that language, to make clear that we think that this money to the FBI is a high enough priority that it needs to be provided and should not be blocked by a decision by OMB. We will also have, when we get to the next section of the bill, a companion amendment. That amendment will add $790 million to the amount that will be spent, not subject to an item veto, to assure that we do not have to demobilize nearly 20 percent of the Guard and Reserves who were called up after the events of September 11. Those Guard and Reserve forces are doing some fundamental work on behalf of this country. It is a poor policy decision that would require us for lack of money to demobilize 20 percent of those forces. The President has said that we would spend whatever it takes in order to win the war on terrorism. Yet OMB has denied the request of the Department of Defense to appropriate all of the money needed so that they do not have to demobilize these forces. The Secretary of Defense issued an internal memorandum to his senior staff complaining about the high pace of operations on regular forces and saying it was creating a strain on those regular forces. Now we have fresh warnings that a reconstituted al Qaeda is planning an attack in the U.S. bigger than that that we saw on September 11. There is good reason to keep Guard and Reserve personnel on board as long as that is the situation. I do not believe that we should continue to treat Guard and Reserve as second-class forces. They are an integral part of our military operations today. I think we need to act as such. These amendments are made possible because of the peculiar accounting practice associated with one provision in the bill. I do not particularly care for that accounting practice, but as long as it has been imposed upon us by OMB and by the senior House leadership, I think at least we ought to provide some constructive use for that language and for that provision. I would say all of you who have been talking all day long about how we need to support the troops, about how we need to be tough on terrorism, you can back up your words with your vote by supporting this amendment and the next amendment that comes along shortly.","word.count":643,"sep11":0.713483146067416,"years":2002.57303370787,"days":2696,"party":"Other","chamber":"","Topic 1":0.0118305579160499,"Topic 2":0.0211627285604607,"Topic 3":0.00218627241318805,"Topic 4":0.0634930456269635,"Topic 5":0.000847709066273829,"Topic 6":0.00173640155484473,"Topic 7":0.00510791879284761,"Topic 8":0.0101442656426409,"Topic 9":0.881061945094568,"Topic 10":0.002429155332163},{"id":"10620000080588","body":"Strom Thurmond: Mr. President, as we draw the 106th Congress to a close, I wish only to take a moment to express my appreciation to Senator Stevens and others who concluded the negotiations on this final appropriations bill.

As a member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, I must express my concerns that this legislation has not been reviewed, had a hearing, or even been seen by members of the committee with the proper jurisdiction. In fact, the contents of this legislation are not available to be reviewed by the American people, let alone my colleagues who will be required to vote on the bill. All that anyone knows about this bill that is supposed to be on the floor next week is a one-page press release the Speaker put out. Yet we will be forced to vote on this bill as soon as we get back next week. This sounds like the Vice President's secret energy task force. And what have we seen since then? The price of gas has almost doubled and the profits of the oil companies have almost tripled since those secret meetings in the White House that no one seems to know anything about. But we know gas prices continue to go up and nobody knows why. The American people deserve real answers and real solutions to these high gas prices. Consumers are currently paying an average of $2.91 per gallon for gasoline. Last summer it was $2.25. Why the almost 70-cent increase? This summer, as the real driving season begins, Americans are expected to pay even more at the pump than last summer. But in the meantime, look at these profits. Look at ExxonMobil, one of the larger oil companies in this country. Look at their profits. You can take all of the net income of the oil companies, their profits in the last year was $113 billion in profits. While the majority party has put out a one-page press release talking about things they would like to do, Democrats have real solutions that could be brought to the House floor today that would have an immediate effect and lower the price of gasoline for all Americans. For example, there are currently no Federal laws against gas price- gouging. The only way the Federal Trade Commission can attempt to prosecute unfair pricing is by using the antitrust laws or the monopoly laws of this country. To date, in the entire history of the Federal Trade Commission, not one, not one case has ever been brought before the courts to prosecute for price gouging. Because the Federal Government does not have a clear definition or standard of what price gouging is, the FTC cannot do little more than make a study of the current gas price situation. Americans are tired of studies and want real answers. Last September I introduced a bill to increase the Federal Government's ability to prosecute price gougers. My bill, the FREE Act, the Federal Response to Energy Emergencies, will provide the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice with the authority to investigate and prosecute those who engage in predatory pricing from oil companies all of the way down to distributors, with an emphasis on those who profit the most. The FREE Act, our legislation that could be on the floor tomorrow, will also allow each State attorney general to go into Federal district court to prosecute unfair pricing practices. When we talk about unfair price practices, we talk about everything in the chain and distribution and supply of oil and gasoline. Take a look at this here, from the time it comes out of the ground, refineries to distributors and retailers, taxes, all of the way to the consumer. We should be able to investigate every aspect of it. If you look at what the Republicans have been proposing, you only get to do an investigation when the President declares a national emergency and it is only for the distributors and retailers, not the refinery who has a 255 percent increase in the cost of refining a gallon of gasoline in a year, nor even the crude oil producers who went up 46 percent in the last year. When we introduced our bill to increase the Federal Government's ability to prosecute price gougers, we included everybody. We want to make sure that the American people are protected from the time it comes out of the ground until you put it in your vehicle. Our legislation expands the Federal Trade Commission's authority to more aggressively pursue market manipulations such as geographic price settings or territorial restrictions put forth by the refineries. Why has gas gone up? In the last 12 months, from September 2004 to September 2005, it has gone up 255 percent. Is that price gouging? We happen to think it is, but we need a clear definition.

Madam Speaker, I agree with many of the comments that have been made on this floor about the dilemma we have now in Iran as a result of our policies in Iraq. I opposed the U.S. involvement in Iraq. I thought it was wrong. And as one of the consequences, it has caused us to lose focus on our war against terror and to make it more difficult for us to deal with Iran. Having said that, I think this is an important bill that we need to move forward. It is an important effort to make it clear that Iran cannot be permitted to become a nuclear weapons power. Madam Speaker, let me point out some of the proudest moments in U.S. history have been the use of sanctions. I think back about U.S. leadership and imposing sanctions basically against the Soviet Union which allowed people to be able to leave that country. I think back about the U.S. leadership in South Africa when it was an apartheid country and how we imposed sanctions against South Africa and were accused of causing problems in doing that. But what we did was bring down the apartheid Government of South Africa without the necessary use of force. So I think it is critically important that we stand united in our efforts to impose sanctions against Iran to make it clear that we cannot allow Iran to become a nuclear weapons power. Make no mistake about it, Iran is trying to do that. We know Iran is trying to do that. We know about the vote of the IAEA of 27-3 that referred Iran to the Security Council, that they are enriching uranium clearly to develop a nuclear weapon, that they have supported terrorist organizations, the Hezbollah and the Islamic Jihad. The Iranian President has made it clear that he wants a world without the United States and he wants to wipe Israel off the face of the map. These are serious threats that we need to take seriously. Therefore, we need effective sanctions against Iran so they change their way. This legislation is an effort to strengthen the sanctions against Iran by removing the sunset, by taking away some of the discretion and removing the sanctions unless Iran changes its way. Madam Speaker, I look at this as a way to engage the international community to work with us. We did not do that in Iraq, and that was one of the fatal flaws of our policy in Iraq is that we did not engage the international community. This legislation says, look, we have a chance with Iran to get them to change their ways through the imposition of sanctions and isolating the country, but we do need the help of our friends around the world. We do need them to work with us. It is in the interest of the civilized world to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear weapons power. We need their help. Working with them, we can add another proud history to America in its international leadership of saying yes, we are going to use our international power, our diplomatic skills, to change the direction of a country that otherwise would become even a more dangerous risk to the United States and the civilized world. I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.","word.count":568,"sep11":4.74157303370786,"years":2006.60112359551,"days":4130,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.15933393204638,"Topic 2":0.0152385838438562,"Topic 3":0.0050362658202155,"Topic 4":0.096336158485064,"Topic 5":0.00175531081989651,"Topic 6":0.00846476500524902,"Topic 7":0.172281800797351,"Topic 8":0.0756137475420884,"Topic 9":0.460828315101396,"Topic 10":0.00511112053850313},{"id":"10620000013316","body":"Tom DeLay: Mr. Chairman, decisions like this ought to be decided by the voters, not through bureaucratic end fighting.

Taggants have been studied. I am holding up one of these studies entitled ``Taggants In Explosives.'' The date is April 1980. The studying office is the Office of Technology Assessment. You can see the thickness of the study. On the issue of safety, what the Office found: That is essentially the world that would be affected by taggants. The taggants would affect, really, these areas. In my amendment we do provide for a study, but what we say is at some point you have to say enough of studying and make a decision and go ahead. Twelve more months of study and then it is implementation, where taggants can be used with safety, with no increase in the volatility of the explosive matter, and where they could lead to being able to trace suspects in bombings. There have been two constituencies opposed to taggants. Let us be brutally frank. One of them is, once again, our friends in the National Rifle Association. And the second is the explosives industry. The explosives industry says taggants would add cost to us. In fact, the cost of using taggants in dynamite, water gels, slurries, emulsions, and cast boosters, as quoted are, per pound, $1.42; $1.47; $1.45, and $7.41 respectively. That is a minimal cost to be able to trace back where an explosive might be used in a bomb that can blow up as many as 168 people at one time. The National Rifle Association has once again opposed the use of taggants. I cannot figure out the reason for the life of me, but I suppose it is because we surround this area with a certain kind of anonymity. I think if ever we have seen the need to increase transparency in sales of explosives we saw it at the World Trade Center and we saw it once again in Oklahoma City. My amendment would also permit the study, and a study only, of chemical fertilizers that are used, like ammonium nitrate, to see if these fertilizers can be made inert. There are countries, for example, that add lime to ammonium sulfate and prevent it from exploding. Should we do that? I think we ought to study it. The amendment in the bill, the original, includes no study in the area of chemical fertilizers and chemical components which are increasingly used as bomb materials in this country. In response to my distinguished chairman, I would only say there is a time to study and there is a time to stop studying and take action. This issue has been studied in 1980. In my amendment it will be studied for another year. But then we will move ahead in the areas I have just mentioned: dynamite, water gels, slurries, emulsions, and black powder. All of these areas can be successfully tagged. The state of the art is there to do it. Switzerland has done it for a number of years. Other countries are doing it and there is no reason why we should not as well.

As you know, I supported allowing this bill to come to the Senate floor for consideration. Congress has not passed a water resources authorization bill since 2000, and particularly in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, this debate is long overdue. While many attempted to derail consideration of this debate, I did not because I believed that we must have this discussion in the open. That being said, I have deep concerns regarding the legislation that is before us today. Specifically, I am concerned that we are missing a historic opportunity to incorporate the many lessons learned since the last WRDA bill passed in 2000. Consider the following developments that highlight the critical need for reform of the Corps of Engineers: I could add several more examples, including the many lessons we have learned in the wake of Katrina, but my point is clear: the processes used for project justification, for long-term planning, for cost containment, and for project accountability are fundamentally flawed and do not serve the best interests of American taxpayers. For too long, we have allowed project costs to soar, routinely accepted inaccurate studies to justify large projects, and rarely, if ever, asked the tough questions of Corps officials. Congress plays a central role in the oversight of all Federal agencies, and with respect to the Corps, we have failed taxpayers miserably. Why? Perhaps a better question would be to ask who benefits most from lax congressional oversight. I would argue that Members themselves are the real winners. We get the projects we want, regardless of the cost or the overall impact on critical national infrastructure, and the Corps is allowed to operate as it pleases. This environment--with every incentive for construction and little or no incentive for accountability--is a recipe for disasters of all sorts. The only way to fix this problem in the long term is to bring fiscal transparency and oversight to this process. First and foremost, we have to develop our ability to prioritize authorized Corps projects. The Corps currently faces a $58 billion dollar project backlog that will take many decades to resolve, and this bill will add over $10 billion more to that backlog. Many worthwhile projects, already debated and authorized by previous Congresses, languish in the annual competition for appropriations. Taking their place in line are politically popular projects that rarely address vital national infrastructure needs. Again, we are failing taxpayers. I am pleased to see the amendment offered by my colleagues, Senators Feingold and McCain, that will squarely address this lack of prioritization. The tools that will be provided by this amendment will strengthen the ability of Members of Congress to analyze the hundreds of authorized Corps projects and determine which are in the best interests of our Nation. Congress maintains its discretion to fund whichever projects it deems most appropriate, but we will do so with an abundance of new data that will highlight critical national infrastructural needs. Funds are increasingly limited, and we have a responsibility to prioritize projects based on their impact. Second, in our efforts to improve this important process, Congress must consider ways to bring greater oversight to the Corps. The many instances of wrongdoing in the Corps project justification process make clear that we must do better. With billions of dollars at stake and often thousands of lives hanging in the balance, we simply cannot allow for manipulation and undue influence in the justification study process. Again, I am pleased to see the efforts of Senators McCain and Feingold in addressing this void. The Corps has proven itself incapable of mending these problems on its own, and nowhere is this more apparent than in the project justification process. It is imperative that outside experts, with no stake in large-scale construction proposals, be allowed to review these types of Corps studies. While I may have designed the amendment in a slightly different manner, I look forward to supporting the McCain-Feingold approach that will allow for a truly independent and time-sensitive review by a panel of experts. At the end of the day, Congress still makes the final decision on which projects to fund, and in no way will this amendment impact our constitutional obligations or slow project construction. We can still fund wasteful and inefficient spending if we so desire. If we pass this amendment, at least we will ensure that the studies we cite are accurate. We owe that to the American public. I am grateful to my colleagues for the countless hours they have spent in putting this bill together. I know the road that led to this debate today was not an easy one, and it has been a long and difficult journey. As we embark on this debate and in our legitimate desire to pass this legislation, however, we must not overlook the critical need for Corps reform. The many lessons we have learned since WRDA 2000 are as numerous as they are pressing. The Corps of Engineers is staffed by many dedicated and hard-working Americans, many of whom are in my State. The agency itself, however, is ailing and demands our attention. If the Corps is to continue to meet the mandate it has been given and serve the needs of the American taxpayer, we must not move forward without the incorporation of new oversight and transparency. America's waterways and flood control projects have played an important role in protecting our communities and in spurring agricultural and industrial commerce. Unless we can reform the Corps, though, their impact will increasingly diminish. As it stands today, the Corps is not accountable to Congress, and ultimately, it is not accountable to the American taxpayer. We have a historic opportunity to change this environment, and we must seize it.","word.count":1049,"sep11":3.80056179775281,"years":2005.66011235955,"days":3795,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0762222092710199,"Topic 2":0.214779833821191,"Topic 3":0.011189976708576,"Topic 4":0.0111398131707211,"Topic 5":0.189140564949608,"Topic 6":0.00341224917288111,"Topic 7":0.00407847334396969,"Topic 8":0.0186696225241637,"Topic 9":0.0104468039458023,"Topic 10":0.460920453092067},{"id":"10820040042715","body":"Barbara Mikulski: Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Daschle amendment to increase funding for VA medical care. America is at war, and my thoughts are with our troops. Our men and women in uniform have my steadfast support, and so do those men and women who fought before them. We need to get behind our troops and our veterans, and use this budget to support them. We must support the brave men and women who have fought for our country. Our veterans need to know that America is with them and that we owe them a debt of gratitude. As the ranking member on the VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, my guiding principle for the VA budget is that we keep the promises we made to our veterans. This means no toll charges on veterans to get health care or prescription drugs, and no waiting lines for veterans to get medical care. But the VA's budget request puts new toll charges and means tests on our veterans. Specifically, the budget proposes four things. First, the budget proposes to keep the VA closed to priority 8 veterans. These are veterans who are not disabled as a result of their service, and who the VA considers to be higher-income. Second, the budget proposes a new $250 membership fee for priority 7 and 8 veterans. Third, the budget assumes that VA will increase outpatient primary care copayments from $15 to $20. And finally, the budget proposes to increase prescription drug copayments from $7 to $15. We have great respect for VA Secretary Principi. He's a combat decorated Vietnam veteran who continues to serve his country. But he's battling OMB now for adequate VA funding, and I am deeply concerned that the budget OMB gave VA this year leaves VA foraging for funding. Over a year ago, the VA health care system stopped accepting new priority 8 veterans. Manufacturing is fading and private health insurance is failing. And many of those affected are priority 8 veterans. Many corporations involved in manufacturing had defined benefits plans that included health plans with guaranteed retiree coverage. For these veterans, VA healthcare is their last safety net, until they turn 65 and are eligible for Medicare. For example, in Maryland, there are 13,000 Bethlehem Steel retirees. Many are Vietnam veterans. They came back from serving their country at war, and they continued to fight for America's national and economic security by working in our steel mills. But now, many have lost their health insurance because of Bethlehem Steel's bankruptcy. They are not eligible for Medicare yet. Under this budget, many will be turned away from VA--the safety net they counted on will not be there because VA will continue to shut-out priority 8 veterans. Bethlehem Steel's veterans, and other veterans who worked in manufacturing or for other businesses that don't offer health insurance, fought for their country and now they will have to fend for themselves on the open-market for health insurance. I am deeply concerned that this policy and many other potholes in VA's budget leave our veterans paying toll charges, standing in lines, or without any healthcare at all. In the last 5 years, the VA-HUD Subcommittee has provided large increases for medical care--$1.7 billion in 2000, $1.3 billion in 2001, $1 billion in 2002, $2.4 billion in 2003, and $3 billion in 2004. We did this because we know that the failure of private health insurance companies and high prescription drug costs are really straining our veterans on fixed incomes. At the same time, our veterans' population is growing, and getting older. Today, VA treats 2 million more veterans than in 1996. Last year, the VA-HUD Subcommittee rejected the proposals that we see in the administration's budget request again this year. Instead, we put $1.6 billion more than the request in the Federal checkbook for VA medical care. Our veterans didn't stand in waiting lines when they were called up or they volunteered to serve our country. So they shouldn't have to stand in line to get medical care. Veterans who need specialized health care services must not be kept waiting--like spinal cord injury care, blind rehab, and prosthetics. For example, the Blinded Veterans Association tells us that there are over 2,000 veterans waiting up to 2 years for admission into a blind rehab center. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support our veterans in this budget by supporting the Daschle amendment.","word.count":737,"sep11":2.5561797752809,"years":2004.41573033708,"days":3352,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.215534636425503,"Topic 2":0.0509768801443594,"Topic 3":0.0147687394644804,"Topic 4":0.0813975809209121,"Topic 5":0.00561042313880193,"Topic 6":0.0269079882306189,"Topic 7":0.0419394087750128,"Topic 8":0.0429248817833562,"Topic 9":0.511961505488868,"Topic 10":0.00797795562808752},{"id":"10820030091258","body":"Lisa Murkowski: Well, as the Senator has noted, her home State of Maine and Alaska both have a very rich history of groundbreaking women, women who have been pioneers, women who have reached out.

Res. 752, expressing continued support for the construction of the Victims of Communism Memorial. In 1993, recognizing ``the deaths of over 100,000,000 victims in an unprecedented imperial communist holocaust,'' Congress authorized the construction of the Victims of Communism Memorial in our Nation's capital, ``so that never again will nations and peoples allow so evil a tyranny to terrorize the world.'' Today, H. Res. 752 reaffirms the importance of the Victims of Communism Memorial and reminds our nation that the men and women whose sacrifice the memorial honors must not be forgotten. Over the past year, significant strides have been made toward the realization of the memorial, including the consideration of a potential location. Several months ago, the National Park Service recommended a site for the Victims of Communism Memorial at Maryland and Constitution Avenues, NE. In July, I and 26 other Members of Congress wrote to the chairman of the National Capital Memorial Commission, encouraging the commission to approve this site for the memorial. Later that month, the commission met to consider this location for the memorial. Citizens representing the Baltic-American, Vietnamese-American and Polish- American communities expressed their strong support for the memorial. They spoke of its importance both for their own communities in commemorating those who have suffered under communist oppression and for our whole nation, which has shared in the struggle against communism. That day, the commission unanimously approved the site for the Victims of Communism Memorial. The Victims of Communism Memorial continues to make its way through the approved process for its site and design. Now that the National Capital Memorial Commission has approved a location, the site must also be approved by Neighborhood Advisory Commission 6-C for Capitol Hill, the Commission on Fine Arts, and the National Capital Planning Commission. The Memorial must then go through the same procedure for design approval. These are important and exciting steps on the way to establishing the memorial to honor over 100 million victims of communism. It is vital that we as Americans remember the sacrifice so many brave men and women have made in the hope of achieving freedom from communist tyranny. Our Nation has long struggled along with them as the leader in fighting communism. This history is also very personal for the estimated 26 million Americans who trace their heritage to former communist countries. When the Victims of Communism Memorial is constructed, it will provide our Nation with a place to commemorate the lives and heroism of those the memorial honors, and to remember the terrible cost of communism.

McClellan is an excellent base with superb, state-of-the-art facilities and is one of the most advanced installations in the entire military. McClellan has its own one-of-a-kind industrial nuclear reactor, a nondestructive aircraft inspection facility, logistics retrofit engineering capabilities, and a technical laboratory with specialized logistics facilities. McClellan is truly a unique asset to our Nation's defense. Finally with regard to McClellan, if economic impact--particularly cumulative economic impact--is going to be considered, then the impact on the northern California region must be considered when looking at McClellan. Already in the Sacramento area, Mather Air Force Base and the Sacramento Army Depot have been slated for closure, resulting in the loss of nearly 7,000 direct jobs. And, in nearby Vallejo, the closure of Mare Island Naval shipyard will result in the loss of an additional 9,000 direct jobs. I do not believe that the Pentagon's recommendation to close Long Beach Naval Shipyard makes sense. In 1993, the Base Closure Commission addressed the issue of whether to close the Shipyard, and the Commission recognized the vital role that Long Beach plays in support of the Pacific Fleet and kept it open. Long Beach Naval Shipyard is strategically located in southern California-- [[Page S 9341]] near 70 percent of the Pacific Fleet in San Diego--and has a large dry- dock capable of docking every class of ship in the U.S. Navy's inventory, including large aircraft carriers. Other Naval shipyards are long distances from the west coast mega-port: Puget Sound is located 1,135 nautical miles from San Diego and Pearl Harbor is located 2,600 nautical miles away. Long Beach is also the most cost-effective shipyard in the Navy. It is the only one of the eight Navy shipyards that operates in the black with annual retained earnings. In just the last 6 fiscal years, Long Beach has been consistently under budget and $102.7 million has been returned to the Navy budget. The closure of Long Beach Naval Shipyard will also have a devastating economic impact. 13,000 jobs and $539 million in annual economic activity will be lost if Long Beach closes. Los Angeles County has taken the brunt of the State's defense downsizing and Long Beach previously suffered from a large base closure: Long Beach Naval Station. Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell may have provided the best defense of Long Beach when he said in 1991 that the: General Powell was right. Long Beach Naval Shipyard should not be closed. Onizuka Air Station has existed in Sunnyvale since the mid-1950's and was created to provide a place where the Air Force satellite control mission and other classified Defense Department tenants could function in collocation. While the Air Force has proposed realigning Onizuka and shifting many of its functions to other bases outside California, the Air Force's proposal actually amounts to a stealth closure of this state-of-the-art base. In the short-term, nearly 3,000 jobs will be lost as a result of Onizuka's realignment. In the long term, Onizuka's closure will cost several thousand additional jobs. In addition to the economic impact on the northern California region, I believe that Onizuka's realignment could have an adverse impact on U.S. national security, particularly with regard to the Nation's satellite control and communication network. I also question the cost- effectiveness of Onizuka's proposed realignment in light of the long pay-back period--7 years--and the fact that the base will continue to operate well into the next century. I am also concerned that the recommendation to realign Onizuka could have been tainted by a 1993 internal Air Force study on the closure of Onizuka. This study was conducted outside of the official BRAC process and estimated the true cost to close Onizuka at hundreds of millions of dollars more than originally estimated by the Air Force. Unfortunately, the existence of this study--which was originally denied by the Air Force--was uncovered late in the BRAC process, thus impeding its full utilization. I ask unanimous consent that the copy of a 1993 Air Force letter, which initiated a study of Onizuka Air Station's closure outside of the official BRAC process, be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.","word.count":704,"sep11":-6.36516853932584,"years":1995.49438202247,"days":176,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0167100522957325,"Topic 2":0.0104270215050915,"Topic 3":0.0753736927548014,"Topic 4":0.0155249832410598,"Topic 5":0.00454088150523272,"Topic 6":0.032188049676932,"Topic 7":0.820950576346093,"Topic 8":0.00619746025755358,"Topic 9":0.0147123143034502,"Topic 10":0.00337496811405305},{"id":"10519970046782","body":"Fritz Hollings: Without objection, it is so ordered","word.count":683,"sep11":-4.6938202247191,"years":1997.16573033708,"days":771,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.283349408166291,"Topic 2":0.0398975648422812,"Topic 3":0.0298367601776138,"Topic 4":0.0753590891953542,"Topic 5":0.00451172494428536,"Topic 6":0.505442232782899,"Topic 7":0.0038893598710665,"Topic 8":0.0460448335672984,"Topic 9":0.00888604766567766,"Topic 10":0.00278297878723221},{"id":"11020070056380","body":"Steve Cohen: Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.","word.count":252,"sep11":6.39606741573034,"years":2008.25561797753,"days":4719,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.392787569791077,"Topic 2":0.369469694930363,"Topic 3":0.00522828239065364,"Topic 4":0.0123037062184095,"Topic 5":0.00787930348295032,"Topic 6":0.00592939618357241,"Topic 7":0.00767591105350806,"Topic 8":0.0248133902246991,"Topic 9":0.168634210778806,"Topic 10":0.00527853494596144},{"id":"11020070016496","body":"Jesse L. Jackson Jr.: You know, Mr. Murphy, I think it is important, and I think we can do a little back and forth here in the spirit of bipartisanship. I see one of our Republican colleagues who would like to share a few things a little later on, and we don't want to take all of the time, because we definitely want to hear from the Republican side this evening in the spirit of what we are doing here. But I think it is important, Mr. Speaker and Mr. Murphy, I think that as we look at what is happening now, we know that we have an historic Presidential election that is taking place. And we are still in the primary mode, but it has a general election spirit that is there. There are slogans out there, ``yes, we can,'' and ``yes, we will,'' and ``change that you deserve.'' It is interesting, because the President is still trying to play a major role. We know that he will be commander-in-chief until January, but I think it is important, especially for some of our friends on the Republican side, that they pay very close attention to the past to understand the future. There was a day and time when the American people were not really paying close attention to what is going on here in Washington, DC There was a time that young people who are concerned about tomorrow more than anyone else in this country were not paying attention to the likes of many of the individuals that are paying attention to politics now. I remember one of the general demographics was 50-plus in the country. You have to make sure that you meet the needs of those individuals. But now that goes from 50-plus all the way down to 17\\1/ 2\\, where Americans can register, and then at 18 they will get their voter registration card. So we have a full kind of age range there of folks that are paying attention to what is happening here. I remember in the early days with Mr. Ryan and I, and then when Ms. Wasserman Schultz got here, Mr. Ryan and Ms. Wasserman Schultz and myself, and now the Majority Makers such as yourself and others are now coming to the floor. But back in the early days we used to share with our friends on the Republican side, you have a choice to make. Either are you are going to be on the New Direction agenda and give the American people what they deserve versus the special interests, or, Mr. Speaker, those Members will be watching the Congress on C-SPAN and other television outlets that would allow them to view what we are doing here on the floor at home while we are here voting. We are in the majority now. We have won three special elections in quote-unquote ``Republican'' districts that were seen as Republican districts. But what I believe in and what I have subscribed to is the American spirit over politics. I believe people are now looking at their families and looking at their children and looking at their grandparents and looking at themselves in the mirror and saying, am I using the power that I possess with my voter registration card towards the benefit of my family, my community, my State, my country? Am I using that to the full advantage that I have as an American citizen? Or am I voting a party, or a personality, or what is politically quote- unquote ``correct''? And I think that question has come back in many of these districts and throughout the country of saying, I have to vote what is best for my children, for my parents, for my grandparents, for myself, for the fact that the economic situation is bad, for the fact that I don't have health care for so many Americans. I have traveled this country, Mr. Speaker, on Presidential election and I have paid attention to what is going on. And every time the question is asked: How many people without health care? A super majority of the people put their hands up. Of course, I don't put my hands up because I am a Member of Congress and I have health care. But my constituents didn't say, hey, you know, Kendrick, we are going to vote for you to be in Congress so that you can have a health care plan for you and your family. We love you that much. Don't worry about us. And they didn't vote for any of us for that reason. I don't think any Member of Congress ran for office saying, I am running to make sure that I can have health care, and then maybe you will have health care. But for some reason, some of our friends on the other side of the aisle didn't get that message or they have forgotten the message. But I am hoping, as we start looking at these issues, that, Mr. Murphy and Mr. Speaker and members, that more Republicans start understanding that this is not the Republican or executive committee back in their county or in their parish or whatever the case may be; that this is the U.S. Congress, and they may have been Federalized by the people in their district, Democrats, Republicans, and Independents, in a general election to come here, provide the kind of representation that they woke up early one Tuesday morning looking for. I say all of that to say this: That if it was about politics, Mr. Murphy, members, we would be home now. We would say nothing. We would allow the Republican minority to continue to get further and further and further in the minority. But the American spirit within our Democratic majority allows the 177 bipartisan votes, that we celebrate the 125 bipartisan votes, over 50 Republican members voting for Democratic measures that would never have made it to the floor on the Republican Congress. The record speaks for itself. I am so happy and so glad that we have the kind of leadership, we have the kind of caucus that says, you know something? We are going to move in a new direction that the American people have called for, Mr. Murphy. Some people call it change now. Change is the big word of this election, because people have had a taste of change already in this House and in the Senate. They want that change in the White House. Now, I want us to kind of go back and forth here, but I just want to share a little bit of the record because some work has been done here. I think it is important that we look at the kind of fight that--and I am going to call some of the things out that you have identified. We have the new GI bill that extends benefits to veterans, and it provides and restores the full 4-year college scholarships for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, and the President has threatened that he is going to veto that. My question is, to the Republican minority, are you going to follow the President with this whole veto issue? If he does, will you leader up and override his veto? Because I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, if we have an override once a week, maybe, just maybe--because the President is not running for election again. I just want to let my Republican colleagues know, they are. Some of them are, those that are not retiring. That they may want to pay attention to what the American people are saying versus what may be coming from the White House, because it hasn't worked, because they are in the minority right now. I think it is also important for the responsible timeline for redeployment that requires Iraqis to pay their fair share of the restoration and other Iraqi policy restrictions that was in H.R. 2642, which is the 2008 supplemental that the President has threatened to veto again. Will our Republican colleagues write the Republican and say, listen, we are already in bad shape as a Republican minority in the Congress, we can't follow you on this. We will join Democrats and override your veto. That is the American spirit. That is not saying, well, I am going to be a good Republican. Because it is important that we understand that folks didn't elect us to be good Republicans or good Democrats saying, well, I am going to follow the President because the President says that it should happen. The first version of the 2007 supplemental, the President vetoed the bill on May 1. I think it is important that folks understand this and the opportunities that we have to continue to build on the bipartisanship. The responsible timeline for redeployment of troops, another bill that passed, H.R. 4156, the President has threatened that he is going to veto that. Also, H.R. 2956, that carries some of the same language. I mean, we are putting these bills out there. That bill passed 223-201. The President is threatening he is going to veto that.","word.count":673,"sep11":5.76123595505618,"years":2007.62078651685,"days":4493,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0187032504888674,"Topic 2":0.445040830378535,"Topic 3":0.00736235715066227,"Topic 4":0.0226329258305879,"Topic 5":0.360060732359511,"Topic 6":0.0861539599773817,"Topic 7":0.00134768969740252,"Topic 8":0.0516596396748062,"Topic 9":0.00230300712650645,"Topic 10":0.00473560731573895},{"id":"10720010011065","body":"Chip Pickering: Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for this wonderful concurrent resolution. As cochair of the Diabetes Caucus and the mother of an eight-year-old child with Type I diabetes, I rise in support of this legislation. Madam Speaker, thank you for allowing me to speak today about diabetes and the need to continue to fund research at a high level as this topic holds a great personal value to me. Over one million people are juvenile diabetics. That number is increasing every day as 13,000 children a year--35 each day--are diagnosed with juvenile diabetes and 17,000 adults a year--46 each day--are diagnosed with juvenile diabetics. Last June I was pleased to serve as Honorary Co-Chair of the 2001 Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation's Children's Congress, during which 200 children with juvenile diabetes came to Washington to advocate for juvenile diabetes research. While in Washington these children asked for our help to ensure that they will soon be free from the burden of finger pricks, insulin injections, hypoglycemia and the fear of complications such as nerve damage, heart attack, blindness and amputation. There is great reason to believe that this hope will be realized. Researchers are closing in on a cure for this disease. As many of you are aware, clinical trials are underway involving the transplantation of insulin producing cells into individuals with juvenile diabetes. 80% of the patients who have received these transplants have been cured of juvenile diabetes and no longer need insulin injections. However, there are two obstacles to this research. The first is that the recipients of the transplanted insulin- producing cells must undergo immunosuppressive therapy to prevent rejection of the cells. This problem is being addressed by the research of the NIH-funded Immune Tolerance Network, the goal of which is to develop a way to transplant organs and tissue, including islet cells, without subjecting the recipients to a lifetime of immunosuppressive therapy. The progress of this research would not only help children with juvenile diabetes, but also patients with a wide variety of autoimmune diseases and disorders, such as Lupus, Rheumatoid Arthritis, and Multiple Sclerosis. The second obstacle is of greater concern to researchers. There is a serious shortage of cadaver pancreases from which the insulin producing cells must be derived for transplant. Less than 2000 pancreases are available each year for both whole organ transplants and the derivation of insulin producing cells for the experimental trails. Therefore, if and when these transplants are ready to be applied to everyone who suffers from juvenile diabetes, only a very small fraction will benefit. Researchers are currently looking for alternate supplies of insulin producing cells. One of the most promising potential sources is embryonic stem cells. Researchers are demonstrating that embryonic stem cells can be turned into insulin producing cells, which could lead to a virtually unlimited supply for transplant into all patients with juvenile diabetes. All Americans suffering from diabetes are in a race against time. Their future could hold deadly complications such as kidney failure, blindness, nerve, amputation and stroke. We owe it to those 17 million Americans--1 million, which are juvenile diabetics--to ensure that all promising avenues of diabetes research, are pursued with adequate resources.","word.count":333,"sep11":-0.235955056179775,"years":2001.62359550562,"days":2358,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0460225950506158,"Topic 2":0.17081843733897,"Topic 3":0.287274218396382,"Topic 4":0.0528898396577714,"Topic 5":0.374655062352987,"Topic 6":0.00466358737986431,"Topic 7":0.00444768083427129,"Topic 8":0.015140686117543,"Topic 9":0.00505673861796229,"Topic 10":0.0390311542536339},{"id":"10519970036870","body":"Joe Scarborough: Mr. Speaker, I would like to again thank the gentleman for his eloquent statement.

As has previously been referred to this morning, I have had the opportunity over the past 6 months to chair the Senate Budget Committee task force on education. During that series of seven hearings that we held, I listened very carefully to a number of witnesses. Both Democrats and Republicans alike came before our committee and discussed the nature of the Federal role in education. The terms that were used and the picture painted was that we had this sprawling endeavor, that is duplicative in many ways, that has not been focused to the degree that any of us would like, which in turn, in many ways, has tied the hands of the education establishment, has tied the hands of State communities and local communities and local school administrators and teachers and principals and parents. We have heard it again and again. I applaud Senator Gorton for building upon his amendment from last year. The amendment that we see today, which I think goes a long way toward accomplishing the goals as recommended by the task force to consolidate--not eliminate, but consolidate--the various efforts we have at the Federal level to accomplish what we want to accomplish; that is, to educate the young people, K through 12 today. We have not been successful in the past. We all know that. That has been demonstrated again and again. The amendment that I introduced today makes the Gorton amendment, I believe, even stronger. Under the Gorton amendment, a State must choose within a 1-year time period and pursuant to a majority vote in their State legislature and with the concurrence of the Governor, one of three options. Again, the beauty of this amendment is that there are three options. After the initial selection under the Gorton amendment, a State can only change that selection one time and only after a 3-year period. My amendment would simply allow a State which has chosen to remain in the current system--again that is the beauty; if a State elects not to change under the Gorton amendment, they don't have to change--if a State does say we will stay exactly as we are today, continue the categorical program that they have today, under my amendment they will be able to opt any time over the next 4 years to go into one of the block grant programs. That is the extent of my amendment. In addition, we heard from States like Kentucky that have biennial State legislatures, and it gives them the opportunity to make that decision after they next meet, since the underlying amendment had this 1-year time limit. The real theme to the Gorton amendment is the flexibility that is given to localities-- flexibility for individual localities and individual States to decide for themselves, based on their own priorities, based on their own identified needs, how to best spend their education dollars. My amendment builds on that flexibility, allowing States to decide, and they are given more choice. The need for consolidation could not be clearer today. We know that over the last 20 years we have had stagnant student performance in science, mathematics, and reading. We have seen that data again and again. Our task force looked at the Federal role in education, and we found this sprawling, unfocused effort that did suffer from a programmatic reluctance to ask the fundamental question: What works and what doesn't work? There is something inherent in the program that prevented us from asking that question, until today. We saw these huge charts that take the 500 Federal programs, or 2,900 programs of the Department of Education, and we saw these overlapping, intertwining, well-intended programs that have lacked the focus, have lacked the streamlined consolidation approach, and they have not worked. What the Gorton amendment allows us to do is choose a system, not change it all for two block grants of about $10 billion, to choose based on your individual needs what might work for you. We have already tabled, over the last 2 days, a school construction program. We will debate other amendments that create a program for dropout prevention, to create new programs. The beauty of the Gorton amendment is that we give the States and the localities the money, and if they have a problem with dropouts, they can identify that program and use the money there. If they don't have a problem, they don't have to use it there. For technology development, we give the States and the localities the option to decide how to spend that money. It is not a partisan issue. People have tried to make it, both in the media and sometimes on the floor, Republicans versus Democrats. We listened carefully in our task force to the Democratic officials from the Chicago school system. They extolled the virtues of flexibility. That is what the Gorton amendment is all about. They said that the flexibility in much of their own program's success in reforming the Chicago system can be--it draws back to that use of block grants, which has that flexibility. They said to our task force: ``We know the system, and we believe we know the things that it needs to have in order to improve.'' They continued: ``So the more flexibility we have with Federal and State funds, the easier it is to make those changes.'' Florida's commissioner of education went on to say: ``We at the State and local level feel the crushing burden caused by too many Federal regulations, procedures, and mandates. Florida spends millions of dollars every year to administer inflexible categorical Federal programs that divert precious dollars away from raising student achievement. Many of these Federal programs typify the misguided, one- size-fits-all command and control approach.'' Those were the words of Florida's commissioner of education. We also heard that the Department of Education has indeed made some progress in eliminating some regulations and consolidating programs. Secretary of Education Riley reported that the Department eliminated 64 programs. But then we heard 2 weeks later from the General Accounting Office that the Department still oversees 244 separate individual programs. Given that the Department and the Secretary are moving in the direction of streamlining and consolidation, it is really confusing to me why the Department and the administration oppose the Gorton amendment, which does just that; it consolidates, it does not eliminate the Department of Education, it does not eliminate the targeted populations; it consolidates and allows individual communities to best choose how to use those same amounts of dollars. Accountability was mentioned. It is a red herring. The Gorton amendment very specifically provides for accountability to both the Federal Government and to those people who really care the most. I am absolutely convinced that the people who really care the most are the parents of those children in those schools. The Gorton amendment very specifically requires public involvement in planning a strategy for the use of block-granted funds and an accounting to the public of the results once the funds are used. Accountability is specifically addressed. Targeting. We heard about the title I population. That is specifically spelled out in this amendment. There is no weakening of the targeting nature of the Federal funding of things like title I. It is interesting to note that the Gorton amendment does not do this. In fact, 100 percent of title I part A funds would flow directly to the local education agencies--100 percent. There is no cutting there. Under the Gorton amendment, 100 percent of the funds would be used by the schools in the classrooms, not with that administrative overlay, administrative cut taken off to be spent here in Washington, DC. No; this makes sure that the targeted populations receive the funds in the classroom. The premise behind both my second-degree amendment and the Gorton amendment is flexibility. States and localities will have the flexibility to decide for themselves how to best use education dollars, not the U.S. Congress' well-intended layering on of program on program, not the administration's budget proposal sent to us in which there were eight new education programs. Another four have been proposed here in the last 2 days. No; we want those moneys, that accountability, that flexibility to be carried out at the local level. The task force heard testimony of numerous witnesses. We heard from Susan Gendrich, who runs a wonderful public school in Murfreesboro, TN, called Cason Lane Academy. We heard that the real beauty, the reason they have been able to accomplish so much, is because they were given the flexibility to have remedial schoolwork in the afternoons by using unused funds that otherwise would have gone to something they did not need. Yes, let the States and the localities exercise some creativity. That is where the innovation actually is. Again, remember, in the last 20 years we have been stagnant in school performance. What we have done through 500 programs, spending $100 billion a year, has not improved education in our public schools. Let's give them an option. That is what this is, an option to keep what you have, to go to a block grant program. Our current approach is simply not working. Let's try a new approach, something novel, and return decisionmaking authority to those closest to our students--the States and the localities. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the Frist amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Missouri. How much time remains?","word.count":1600,"sep11":-3.47752808988764,"years":1998.38202247191,"days":1204,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0325792677592179,"Topic 2":0.0249421795204952,"Topic 3":0.00734857367849033,"Topic 4":0.00464963931731645,"Topic 5":0.34756298296586,"Topic 6":0.00485351112726579,"Topic 7":0.00353767594755971,"Topic 8":0.545707293272302,"Topic 9":0.0164960577391237,"Topic 10":0.0123228186723684},{"id":"10720020057606","body":"Robert Byrd: I see a more colorful hue as I look for it out here. My little dog's name is Trouble. My wife named the dog. Obviously, she was looking at me when she named the little dog Trouble. That little dog Trouble loves me, but he loves my wife more. My wife is in the hospital right now. I should go over to visit her. I am a little too late already. I am trying to remember what the great Englishman, Edmund Burke, said about the origin of the term ``whip.'' The ``whipper-in'' was the person who kept the hound from running away from the field in the fox chase. The English had the whip in the 14th century, certainly in the 17th century, the 1600s. The whip at that time would send what they called a ``circular letter'' to the King's supporters, or if there was a whip in the opposition, he would send a circular letter to the opponents of the King and tell them to come in and meet in Parliament at a certain day and a certain time about a certain piece of business. That was the whip. That was the English whip. That is where the whip system started. The House has a whip. The Senate has not had a whip as long as the other body has had a whip. The Senate has a great whip in the distinguished senior Senator from Nevada. I have been a whip, and before that I served under whips. I was a whip for 6 years, and I was a good whip. I stayed on the Senate floor all the time. But I say right here and now, as far as I am concerned, Senator Reid of Nevada is the best whip the Senate has ever had, notwithstanding even that I was a Senate whip. I served as whip when Mr. Mansfield was majority leader. I put everything I had into being a whip. I stood by the gate. If I had been told to guard that gate, I would have been at that gate alive or dead when Mr. Mansfield came back. This Senator from Nevada, as far as I am concerned, is the best whip we have ever had. He is right here on this floor all the time, or within a voice from this floor. He works here on this floor. He is very loyal to his majority leader, and he is loyal to his duties, to his people back home. He tells me every now and then he has a delegation from Nevada that he has to go and see. But this whip is here at all times, and he is here to protect me. If I to leave the floor, he will protect me. I know he will. He is a good whip. He is a great whip. I will take my hat off any day and say: Gunga Din, you are a better whip than I am. That is saying a lot. I don't say that often. I was a good whip, but the Senator is a better whip than I was because he probably is more loyal to his party than I was and more loyal to his majority leader than I was. I stood on this floor offering an amendment during the Vietnam war to say the President of the United States--who happened to be Richard Nixon at the time--had a duty to do whatever it took. If it meant bombing the Vietcong across the lines in Cambodia, the President had a duty to do that to protect our American servicemen. I offered that amendment, and my majority leader was opposed to it. I stood by it; I fought the fight and lost. Mr. Nixon called me on the telephone that same afternoon from Camp David. He said: You did a great thing down there. He called me Bob. My wife does not call me Bob. She is kind enough to call me Robert. He said: Bob, that's a great thing you did. In his words, he said: You did a statesmanlike job. You stood for what you believed in, and you offered an amendment on behalf of the servicemen, the men in the field. You stood by what you thought, and you even stood against your own party, the leadership. That was all right, and that was well and good for me because I have my own views of what is required of me. But the distinguished Senator from Nevada, he is not disloyal to his leader, not to the people over here who elected him to his position in the Senate, nor to the people back in Nevada who sent him here. I salute him. I will quietly fold my tent and fade away from the Chamber if he is about to tell me that there will not be any more votes and that tomorrow, when we come back, I may have the floor again.","word.count":826,"sep11":1.02808988764045,"years":2002.88764044944,"days":2808,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.210704063388027,"Topic 2":0.188583790811272,"Topic 3":0.266005305278414,"Topic 4":0.0214992387731521,"Topic 5":0.0115833359908141,"Topic 6":0.00821316744716703,"Topic 7":0.00869117479685297,"Topic 8":0.017290143669029,"Topic 9":0.260323859289302,"Topic 10":0.00710592055597052},{"id":"10820040048356","body":"Edward Kennedy: Mr. President, the real crisis which confronts us is not an asbestos litigation crisis, it is an asbestos-induced disease crisis. Asbestos is the most lethal substance ever widely used in the workplace. Between 1940 and 1980, there were 27\\1/2\\ million workers in this country who were exposed to asbestos on the job and nearly 19 million of them had high levels of exposure over long periods of time, and that exposure changed many of their lives. Each year more than 10,000 of them die from lung cancer and other diseases caused by asbestos. Each year, hundreds of thousands of them suffer from lung conditions which make breathing so difficult they cannot engage in the routine activities of daily life. Even more have become unemployable due to their medical condition. Because of the long latency period of these diseases, all of them live with a fear of a premature death due to asbestos-induced disease. These are the real victims. They deserve to be the first and foremost focus of our concern. The victims are average, hard-working Americans. They are the construction workers who build our houses, machinists who keep our factories running, assembly workers who make products for our home, shipbuilders who help make our country strong and secure. They did their jobs faithfully and now it is time for us to do right by them. All too often, the resulting tragedy these seriously ill workers and their families are enduring becomes lost in a complex debate about the economic impact of asbestos litigation. We cannot allow that to happen. The litigation did not create these costs. Exposure to asbestos created them. They are the costs of medical care, the lost wages of incapacitated workers, the cost of providing for the families of workers who died years before their time. Those costs are real. No legislative proposal can make them disappear. All legislation can do is shift those costs from one party to another. Any proposal which would have the effect of shifting more of the financial burden on to the backs of injured workers is unacceptable to me, and I would hope that it would be unacceptable to every one of us. Unfortunately, that is precisely what the Frist bill would do. The bill before us does not reflect what is necessary to compensate the enormous numbers of workers who suffer from asbestos-induced disease. It reflects only what the companies who made them sick are willing to pay. The compensation levels in the Frist bill are unreasonably low, especially for the most seriously ill worker. They would receive much less compensation under the bill than they are currently getting on average in the tort system. For example, workers with 15 years of exposure to asbestos, who are dying of lung cancer, would get as little as $25,000 under the Frist bill. That is absurd. While most of these workers smoke, a person who smoked and was exposed to asbestos is over four times more likely to get lung cancer than a person who smoked but was not exposed to asbestos. Asbestos was clearly a major contributing factor to their lung cancers. Yet this bill would give them next to nothing. Not only does this bill not provide adequate levels of compensation, there is no guarantee that sufficient funds will be available to fully pay all injured workers who are eligible, even what the bill promises them. According to a CBO analysis, the Frist bill is underfunded by nearly $30 billion. If the asbestos trust fund does become insolvent, workers will have to wait years before they can return to the tort system, and many of them will be dead by then. Any proposal which would merely create one new, large, unfunded trust in place of the many smaller underfunded bankruptcy trusts which exist today is unacceptable. Injured workers need certainty even more than businesses and insurers. The Frist bill merely shifts more of the financial burden of asbestos-induced disease to the injured workers by unfairly and arbitrarily limiting the liability of defendants. Sick workers would receive lower levels of compensation than they receive on average in the current system, and payment of even those lower levels of compensation would not be guaranteed. That is no solution at all. I hope we would not consider this bill before us but go back to the drawing board and get a bill that will meet the needs of all the parties. I yield back the remainder of my time.","word.count":746,"sep11":2.67977528089888,"years":2004.5393258427,"days":3396,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.140214469250758,"Topic 2":0.118691755303361,"Topic 3":0.0403707282370534,"Topic 4":0.0146323611613939,"Topic 5":0.023704844661959,"Topic 6":0.019201307329905,"Topic 7":0.0393162987361416,"Topic 8":0.102569770092929,"Topic 9":0.493707768431729,"Topic 10":0.00759069679477066},{"id":"11020070014589","body":"Rahm Emanuel: Mr. Speaker, today or sometime this week, this House will vote on additional funds for the wars in the Middle East, Iraq and Afghanistan.

Many of the issues that came before the conference and required extensive debate were extraneous matters that had nothing to do with the primary purposes of the bill, to provide emergency appropriations for our men and women in uniform in Bosnia and Southwest Asia and to provide emergency disaster assistance to those of our citizens who have suffered from the devastating series of natural disasters that have beset the country in recent months--from the ice storms this past winter in the northeast to the flooding in the western and southern portions of the nation, as well as the recent killer tornadoes throughout the southern states. There was very little disagreement on these matters among the conferees. We all understood the urgency of providing the necessary resources for these emergency purposes. Nevertheless, as I say, we were faced with a number of potential controversial, extraneous legislative riders which had to be debated and disposed of. Those issues ranged from whether to include language in this conference agreement that was in neither version of the bill relating to such things as: interest rates on guaranteed student loans; whether to insert portions of the recently-completed Agricultural Research Conference Report; and whether to override the President's Executive Order prohibiting the importation of assault weapons. Such extraneous issues consumed a considerable amount of time but, I am pleased to say, most were not adopted by the conference. In all, the bill contains some $2.86 billion to cover the cost of the military operations in Bosnia and Southwest Asia, together with $2.6 billion in emergency disaster assistance payments, principal among which are $1.6 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, $259 million in emergency Federal-aid highway relief, and $130 million for community development block grants. The appropriations for the Department of Defense, as well as the disaster assistance payments were requested by the President as emergency appropriations and, as such, under the Budget Enforcement Act, require no offsets. The Senate version of the bill, therefore, contained no offsets for any of the aforementioned emergency items. Nevertheless the House conferees insisted that the appropriations totaling $2.6 billion for emergency assistance for natural disasters be offset, in budget authority only, by rescissions of $2.3 billion in Section 8 Housing authority reserves and $241 million in excess contract authority in the FAA Airport Improvement Program. I am pleased that the conferees accepted the Senate amendment which provided the full $550 million request of the President for veterans compensation and pensions. These funds were not included in the House version of the bill before the conferees. The funds are needed to accommodate the additional costs associated with the 1998 cost-of- living adjustment of 2.1 percent for compensation beneficiaries; an increase in the estimated number of compensation beneficiaries; and an increase in the average payments to compensation and pension beneficiaries. It is important that we keep faith with our veterans, who have sacrificed so much in their service to our country, and I am delighted that the conferees agreed to provide these funds on a timely basis so that there will be no interruption in these payments to our veterans. In addition, the bill also includes some $142 million in appropriations for various agencies to enable them to continue their operations throughout the balance of the fiscal year. These latter amounts are appropriately offset by rescissions. I am pleased that the conference accepted my amendment to the Senate- version of the bill, which was cosponsored by the distinguished chairman of the committee, Mr. Stevens, and which requires the President to seek support aggressively from our allies and friends to share the burden of containing the Iraqi menace in the Middle East. In my view, Mr. President, this provision is essential as I do not believe that we should shoulder this burden alone. To this end, I note that the distinguished chairman of the committee, as well as selected other members of the committee, will shortly depart for the Middle East in order to impress upon the leaders of our allies in that area of the world the importance that we place upon increased burdensharing by our allies in this very critical aspect of international peacekeeping that is so important to stability in today's world. Finally, Mr. President, I am disappointed that the House conferees were unable to accept a Senate amendment offered by myself, Senator Dorgan, and other Senators to establish a congressional commission to study causes and consequences of our trade deficits. I have noted that the trade deficit numbers for February are now at a decade-high monthly level, primarily as a result of the Japanese economic problem. We have not had a comprehensive review of our national trade policies since 1970--nearly 30 years ago. This legislation has been 3 years in the making, and my Senate amendment would have established a congressional commission composed of twelve members--six members nominated by the Senate and six members nominated by the House, four of whom shall be Members of congress. Nevertheless, the conferees did agree in the Statement of Managers to include the following: ``The managers considered, but did not adopt, language that would create a Trade Deficit Review Commission, as proposed by the Senate. The conferees agree that serious concerns exist regarding continuing trade deficits and intend to work with the legislative committees of jurisdiction to establish such a Commission, including in the context of the fiscal year 1999 appropriations process.'' Mr. President, this is a matter of high priority. Senator Dorgan and I will be monitoring this important matter closely. We hope that the various legislative committees of jurisdiction will take up this issue at a very early date. In any case, the members can count on Senator Dorgan and me to revisit this matter on a timely basis later this year if no action has been taken in the interim. I know that the administration is disappointed that the conference has not chosen to include payments to the International Monetary Fund. This matter was debated at great length during the conference and it was determined that the House, at this time, was not prepared to yield on this issue. I, again, thank all conferees for their diligent efforts throughout the past week in resolving all of the difficult issues faced in the conference and particularly the chairman of our committee, Senator Stevens, who chaired this, his first supplemental appropriations conference, with great patience, skill, and good humor. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.","word.count":1133,"sep11":-3.45505617977528,"years":1998.40449438202,"days":1212,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.00516753449346268,"Topic 2":0.405888178301395,"Topic 3":0.090923261752295,"Topic 4":0.0111959681168698,"Topic 5":0.192600726291241,"Topic 6":0.0123827246060399,"Topic 7":0.02365274064269,"Topic 8":0.146135839600945,"Topic 9":0.04840250761019,"Topic 10":0.0636505185848709},{"id":"10720020032592","body":"Patty Murray: Mr. President, I rise today to speak on two tribal forestry amendments that were included in the Farm Bill that passed the Senate yesterday. I was pleased to work on these amendments with Senators Inouye, Daschle, Cantwell, Baucus, and Wellstone. The purpose of these amendments is to improve coordination between the United States Forest Service and Native Americans in managing and protecting our natural resources. The Forest Service owns millions of acres of forests and grasslands that share borders with land owned by tribes and by individual Native Americans. It is in the national interest for the Forest Service and tribes to coordinate their efforts to protect and manage these resources. It is also the Federal Government's fiduciary responsibility to assist tribes in managing trust lands and to ensure that tribal treaty rights on Forest Service lands are upheld. While over the years the Forest Service has adopted many policies regarding relationships with tribal governments, these policies have not been implemented consistently. In 1999, the Chief of the Forest Service created a National Tribal Relations Task Force to make recommendations to strengthen policies and improve coordination. The Task Force, which included representatives from the Forest Service, the Intertribal Timber Council and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, BIA, found that, ``Specific legal authorities, authorizing legislation, regulations, manuals, and handbooks, must be modified to expand the foundation necessary to build long-term working relationships with Indian Tribes.'' These amendments build upon the recommendations made by the Task Force. The first amendment expands the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act to include a section creating four programs for tribal governments. Currently, tribes are eligible to participate in the Forestry Incentives and Forest Stewardship programs created by the Act, but there are significant barriers to tribal involvement in these programs, which were designed primarily for state governments. This amendment would allow the Secretary to facilitate tribal consultation and coordination on issues related to tribal rights and interests on Forest Service land, management of shared resources, and tribal traditional and cultural expertise. It would also authorize the Secretary to provide assistance with: conservation awareness programs on tribal forest land; technical assistance for resources planning, management and conservation; and tribal acquisition of conservation interests from willing sellers. The second amendment to the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act would create an Office of Tribal Relations within the Forest Service. The purpose of this Office is to provide advice to the Secretary on Forest Service policies and programs affecting Native Americans, to ensure coordination between the Forest Service and tribes and to administer tribal programs set up by the Forest Service. The amendment also requires the Office to coordinate with other agencies within the Agriculture Department, as well as with the BIA and the Environmental Protection Agency. Finally, the amendment requires the Office to create an annual report on the status of these efforts to increase partnerships between the Forest Service and Native Americans. There is widespread support for these amendments authorizing greater collaboration between the Forest Service and Native American tribes. The Department of the Interior is in favor of these amendments, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture has signed off on them as well. I have heard from several Washington state tribes asking me to be an advocate for these additions to the Forestry Title of the Farm bill. I am especially grateful for the Makah Tribe and the Intertribal Timber Council, which brought these ideas to me last year. Also, I greatly appreciate the assistance I have received from Senators Daschle, Inouye, Cantwell, and Baucus in working on these amendments. I also appreciate help I received from Senators Harkin and Lugar so these amendments could be included in a manager's package of amendments to the Farm Bill.

Now, opponents can say what they want, but if you look at the figures, they don't lie. And what they tell you is that year after year after year we are increasing student aid. What does this bill do? It strengthens Pell Grants, strengthens student aid, reduces red tape for students and graduates, removes barriers for nontraditional students, empowers consumers through sunshine and transparency in college costs. Also, it safeguards the privacy of students, eases college access for members and veterans of the armed services. It repeals duplicative and expired or unnecessary programs, and it promotes merit-based pay for teachers through the Teacher Incentive Fund, which is something I have a particular interest in. The Teacher Incentive Fund specifically targets high-poverty schools, and it provides some extra compensation for teachers who achieve. The initiative rewards those who have delivered on student achievement. It was a recommendation of the bipartisan National Governors Association, which called for the creation of the Teacher Incentive Fund, and we responded.

Let me address one concern that people have, [[Page S4493]] that this will be viewed as somehow anti-Russian. There is no question the Russians do not like this move toward expanding NATO, and there is no question that there are genuine fears, whether justified or not, on the part of some of the countries of Central Europe with Russia. There is no reason, at some point in the future when democracy is insolubly established in Russia--and it is moving in the right direction--that Russia cannot become a part of NATO. As a matter of fact, if I were a Russian leader looking at a potential foe, I would not be looking to the West, I would be looking to the East-- China, with all the population and potential there. I think this is not only in the best interest of the countries of Central Europe. I think this is in the best interest of Russia, and I am pleased to be a cosponsor. &lt;bullet&gt; Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud to rise as a cosponsor of the NATO Participation Act Amendments of 1995. This bipartisan legislation will increase security and stability in eastern Europe, and will contribute to the security of the United States. This year we are marking the 50th anniversary of our victory in World War II. But the end of the World War was also the start of the cold war. Soviet expansionism forced us to prepare to defend western Europe. And the captive nations of eastern Europe were forced behind the Iron Curtain. After more than 40 years of living under Soviet tyranny, Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia are free and independent. They are not asking for protection. They are merely asking to be full partners in the new Europe. By transforming their countries into free- market democracies, they have earned this right. If our international organizations are to survive--as I believe they must--they must adapt to the post-cold-war world. This sounds so obvious. Yet NATO is still mired in its cold war structure. We still have not established the criteria for NATO membership--let alone a timetable for admitting new states. In recent months the United States has more explicitly stated that NATO will be expanded. I applaud this. But our NATO partners have been dragging their feet. This legislation will help to clarify the United States position on NATO expansion--and will enable us to lead the alliance to meet the challenges of the post-Soviet world. We have all heard the arguments against expanding NATO. Some believe that we will offend Russia by expanding NATO membership. I disagree. NATO is a defensive organization. A country that doesn't have expansionist aims has nothing to fear from an expanded NATO. Mr. President, for many years I have worked with Senator Brown and Senator Simon to make the United States a more effective advocate for democracy and economic development in eastern Europe. I commend them for their leadership and look forward to working with them to enact the NATO Participation Act Amendments into law.&lt;bullet&gt; S. 601. A bill to revise the boundaries of the Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. the blackstone river valley national heritage corridor reauthorization &lt;bullet&gt; Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure today to introduce legislation to reauthorize and expand the boundaries of the Blackstone River Valley National Heritage corridor. I am delighted to be joined in this effort by my colleagues from Rhode Island and Massachusetts, Senators Pell, Kennedy, and Kerry, all of whom have worked hard on this issue through the years. Before I describe our legislation in detail, allow me to provide a little historical background for the benefit of my colleagues. Known as the cradle of the Industrial Revolution, the Blackstone Valley is the place where modern America begins--200 years ago on the banks of the Blackstone River, in Pawtucket, RI, Samuel Slater built our Nation's first water-powered textile mill, an event which changed this country forever. Backed by capital from Providence, other entrepreneurs followed Slater's lead. Factories and villages sprang up along the river's banks. Families migrated from farms into the towns. Canals--and later railroads--were built to improve the transportation of goods. Immigrants from all over Europe came to the region in search of work and opportunity. In the 1920's, the region's prosperity began to fade. Mills closed and moved south. The Great Depression made matters worse. In subsequent years, the Blackstone, which had been renowned as ``the hardest working river in America'' became just another neglected, polluted body of water. But people in the valley recognized that the river still had a story to tell. Evidence of the region's glorious past remained in abundance. Beautiful dams, bridges, mills, villages, farms, and pastures--all these things contribute to a special sense of place, identity, and history. Many began to realize that preserving and celebrating the area's past was the key to a brighter future. In the early 1980's, we prevailed upon the National Park Service to conduct a study of the Blackstone Valley. They too concluded that its resources were of national significance and were well worth preserving. The question was: How? With half a million people living there, the valley does not lend itself to the traditional national park strategy where the Federal Government owns and manages the land. What was needed was an approach that would encourage cooperation among communities, across State lines, and between the private and public sectors. And so, in 1986, through legislation which Senators Pell, Kennedy, Kerry, and I advanced together, the Blackstone River Valley National Heritage corridor was born. Stretching 46 miles along the Blackstone River, from Worcester, MA to Providence, RI, the corridor encompasses 20 cities and towns over a 250,000-acre area. Efforts to interpret and preserve the valley's historical and scenic resources are coordinated by the Blackstone Corridor Commission, which receives modest Federal funding to support its operations. The National Park Service works closely with the Commission, providing invaluable technical assistance and guidance. Not surprisingly, there were some who doubted that the corridor concept could work. It was, of course, unlike anything that had been tried before. But I can say with great confidence that the Blackstone corridor is working. And it is working precisely because it is not managed like the traditional national park. Under the umbrella of the Corridor Commission, individuals from different communities, businesses, levels of government, and walks of life are working together toward a common vision, and with impressive results. Historic treasures are being uncovered, interpreted, and restored. Old mills are being converted for modern use. Visitors now can enjoy the Blackstone by riverboat or canoe. Parks are being established along its banks. A greenway, for bicyclists and hikers is well underway. A Friends of the Blackstone group is cleaning up the river. National Park Service rangers and volunteers are educating visitors about the valley's rich history. A strategy for reintroducing salmon to the Blackstone river is being developed. Imagine that, salmon coming back to a river that was once an environmental disgrace. And all this is being done with relatively little money from the Federal Government, because every Federal dollar that goes into the corridor is leveraged many times over by the Commission, sometimes by as much as twenty to one. In fact, often the Commission provides no money at all, just the expertise and cando attitude needed to shepherd a project from concept to reality. This bill, which is identical to legislation introduced in the last Congress by Senator Kennedy and approved by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee last year, builds upon that success. It extends the life of the Blackstone Corridor Commission--which, under current law, will expire in November 1996--for another 10 years, and gives the Secretary of Interior the authority to extend the Commission [[Page S4494]] for an additional 10 years thereafter, providing the Commission meets certain criteria. In addition, the bill will add to the corridor five new communities-- three in Rhode Island and two in Massachusetts--which are culturally and historically tied to the existing corridor and contain the headwaters of the Blackstone River. This logical expansion will allow the Commission to interpret and protect the region's resources in a comprehensive and unified fashion. Finally, our legislation increases the Commission's annual authorization from $350,000 to $650,000, in recognition of its tremendous success and new responsibilities, and authorizes up to $5 million over 3 years in matching funds for development projects within the corridor. Mr. President, it seems to me that protecting and preserving our Nation's special places, like the Blackstone Valley, is one of the Federal Government's most important functions. But as we all know, preservation does take money, and money is tight. I would submit that in these tough budgetary times, the Blackstone Corridor, which has accomplished so much with so little, offers us a model that should be encouraged and expanded upon. I thank my colleagues from Rhode Island and Massachusetts for their hard work and support, and urge the Senate to give this measure its swift approval. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:","word.count":1564,"sep11":-6.64044943820225,"years":1995.2191011236,"days":78,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.90229342644198,"Topic 2":0.030716203302517,"Topic 3":0.00717193959346547,"Topic 4":0.0172408805004045,"Topic 5":0.007010578338935,"Topic 6":0.00769038481253216,"Topic 7":0.00530298492339179,"Topic 8":0.0128909199918679,"Topic 9":0.00667794161359901,"Topic 10":0.00300474048130717},{"id":"11020070003354","body":"Marcy Kaptur: Mr. Speaker, tomorrow the House will vote on commonsense legislation to extend the production tax credit and investment tax credit and pay for it by reducing wasteful subsidies to big oil companies.

Mr. Chairman, thanks to my chairman the gentleman from Kentucky and the gentleman from West Virginia , the ranking member. I strongly support the Mollohan-Fox amendment to increase funding for the Legal Services Corporation. The people I represent direly need access to the legal system. The bill, as reported by the committee, cuts next year's funding for the Legal Services Corporation by 50 percent. That is a very big cut, from this year's level of $238 million to $141 million. That is a very big cut. This cut is a continuation of the House Republicans' efforts to tear down a legal system that President Nixon and the Congress jointly created in 1974. Last year, the committee also recommended a level of $141 million. There is no budgetary need, Mr. Chairman, to cut Legal Services by 50 percent. There is no budgetary need for that. The other body, the Senate version of this bill increases Legal Services funding by $17 million, even though the total size of the Senate bill is more than $700 million smaller than the bill we are considering. There is no budgetary need to cut Legal Services Corporation. Do my colleagues know who the majority party seems to be attacking? They seem to be attacking the poor, particularly women and children. I have asked the head of the Legal Services of Greater Miami to tell me about the type of cases they serve every day. Many of these cases are so pitiful that it hurts to even hear them recount it. There is a case that involved a woman who wanted her 6-year-old daughter who is mentally retarded because of Downs Syndrome to attend a regular kindergarten in her neighborhood school. Legal Services got the school district to agree to mediation. As a result of this mediation process, the school district agreed to train the regular teacher to handle this child and she is now a full participant in a regular first grade class. This could not have happened if it were not for the intervention by Legal Services. Mr. Chairman, if these had been wealthy people, they would have hired private lawyers because their cause is just. But they are not wealthy, and so they go to Legal Services for help in getting justice. This is not the time, Mr. Chairman, to be cutting legal services. I call to the attention of my colleagues another one of the cases in my district. Mrs. Dee and her three young children had rented an apartment from the Dade County Housing Authority. For many years, there was a backup of sewage, garbage, and human waste from the entire building flowing through her apartment out of her toilets, faucets, and tub. As a result, Mrs. Dee's possessions were contaminated and they were water logged. Her apartment became mildewed, which exacerbated her children's asthma and heart conditions. These are signs of poverty. Despite the extreme seriousness of the situation, Mrs. Dee was unable to convince the Housing Authority to either repair the building plumbing or transfer her to another apartment. Therefore, she sought the services of Legal Services of Greater Miami. Legal Services sought an immediate transfer of this family and compensation for the loss of Mrs. Dee and her family's possessions. After heated negotiations, Legal Services recovered enough money for the lost possessions and a transfer to another apartment. I repeat that this is not the time to cut the Legal Services Corporation in that they are providing a function, particularly for the poor, particularly for children. I urge my colleagues to support the Mollohan-Fox amendment.","word.count":607,"sep11":-3.18820224719101,"years":1998.67134831461,"days":1307,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.225539273399271,"Topic 2":0.520364979229212,"Topic 3":0.00577276224090279,"Topic 4":0.0585572590947027,"Topic 5":0.0108965049407587,"Topic 6":0.00308258368177187,"Topic 7":0.00608860674965513,"Topic 8":0.0313040730795589,"Topic 9":0.0689327060228243,"Topic 10":0.069461251561343},{"id":"10419960002471","body":"Lincoln Diaz-Balart: Mr. Speaker, I take the floor today because a most distinguished colleague of ours took the floor earlier this morning and said that he had a meeting with dissidents in Havana, Cuba, last week, and he mentioned a couple of names of dissidents who were opposed to our sanctions against Castro.

Kerry: Mr. President, let me speak for a minute about this legislation. I understand Senator DeMint's need to object on behalf of the Senator from Oklahoma. This is legislation that has broad--I do mean broad--bipartisan support. It was passed out of the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee on a unanimous vote. It now represents a very broad compromise worked on with the administration and with all of the members of the committee, both Republican and Democrat. I will review very quickly what this bill does. As everybody knows, when Katrina hit, we had a terrible time getting small business assistance to the countless thousands of small businesses that were impacted, not only in New Orleans but in Baton Rouge and across into Mississippi, Alabama, and elsewhere, where there were many services being provided by other folks. A lot of small businesses were impacted. We learned there was not an adequate capacity within the Small Business Administration to deliver this kind of assistance in a rapid way. So we have worked now, after a series of hearings and over the course of 2 years, to pull together the Small Business Disaster Response and Loan Improvement Act. It does a number of things. It creates a new elevated level of disaster declaration, referred to as catastrophic national disaster. That triggers nationwide economic injury disaster loans for adversely affected small businesses. In addition, it requires the SBA to create an expedited disaster assistance business loan program to provide businesses with expedited access to short-term money. A lot of the businesses in New Orleans could have survived and might have survived or chosen to try to if there had been some bridge money or available working capital. But the absence of it forced a lot of them to close their doors. If we can provide assistance in a timely fashion, obviously subject to the administration's approval--and there is discretion in the bill--we would have the ability to do a better job. In addition, there are improvements to the existing loan program which have been written in the bill. There is improved agency coordination and marketing. It directs the SBA to coordinate with FEMA in a more effective way. It directs the SBA to create a proactive marketing plan to make the public aware of the disaster response services. In addition, it provides improved planning and oversight and directs the SBA to update the hurricane response plan to address all future disasters. This is, as I say, with bipartisan support. I have a letter from the Administrator of the SBA, Steve Preston. He writes saying: And that is what we just sought to do-- We would obviously love to do that. It appears there is one person in the Senate, the Senator from Oklahoma, who is opposed to moving forward with this legislation. As I say, there was a unanimous vote by our committee, which wants to see if we could achieve this disaster assistance. Nobody understands how critical this is more than the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, who has been fighting from the moment Katrina hit to try to get this kind of disaster assistance. I wish to ask the Senator if she would share with us her observations as to why this legislation is so critical and what specifically we have done to address some of the concerns of those who had previously expressed those concerns in order now to have a consensus about this legislation. I ask the Senator from Louisiana if she would explain the situation in New Orleans, not just then but now, and why this legislation is so critical.","word.count":600,"sep11":5.99719101123596,"years":2007.85674157303,"days":4577,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0402033550459657,"Topic 2":0.283914456059311,"Topic 3":0.276031571644702,"Topic 4":0.0181639446371254,"Topic 5":0.0556290825118465,"Topic 6":0.00414365732928386,"Topic 7":0.00820966153805823,"Topic 8":0.0212097792361173,"Topic 9":0.101727690927577,"Topic 10":0.190766801070014},{"id":"10619990007662","body":"Nancy Pelosi: Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Virginia for yielding me the time, as well as our colleague, the gentleman from Texas , for allowing us to move forward on this bill. The Northeast has traditionally been a geographically hard location for much transportation of resources, like home heating oil and gasoline. We also have a very older style of architecture which often causes us to have very inefficient buildings and, unfortunately, that leak during the wintertime of heat and resources and energy. We also have a much colder environment in the Northeast than most parts of the country. All these factors lead to us as being big consumers of home heating oil. Unfortunately, also over the years we have reduced the amount of inventory that we have traditionally had the capability of keeping in the Northeast. In 1991 we had about 4 million barrels of home heating oil on reserve in the Northeast. Since the Gulf War, we have traditionally built it up, to last year we had about 17 million barrels on hand. But this year we dropped to almost an all-time low back down to about 4.5 million barrels. Inventory is an important part of making sure that the Northeast has an adequate supply to provide for home heating oil. This bill will go a long way to improving the inventory. I compliment the members from the majority side for bringing this bill forward that we have been working so hard on. We must recognize, though, that only 2 million barrels is hardly a drop in the bucket to what we really need. I would hope that as we move this bill through conference that they would look at increasing the home heating oil reserve to in the neighborhood of 3 or 4 million barrels versus the 2 million barrels that is proposed. We also must do other things, though. We have to look at alternative sources of energy such as natural gas, such as making sure we have solar power. We must also provide the kinds of tax incentives we need for conservation. That is for better winterization programs, for building materials and other things that will help enhance and reduce the amount of energy loss that we have in our buildings. All of these elements taken in composite will make us a more efficient user of energy, such as petroleum products. I hope that as we begin to move forward with this session and as we wrap up before this fall, we will truly have a number of tax incentives for winterization and conservation, alternative sources of energy, as well as improving our stocks of inventory, as we are under this bill. I thank both the majority and minority for bringing this bill forward. I also want to compliment my colleagues who have been working so hard on this, particularly the gentleman from Vermont , the gentleman from Massachusetts , the gentleman from Massachusetts , and of course, the gentleman from Maine . We have all been working hard because our constituents hurt very hard this winter. We saw prices in Rhode Island go from 99 cents a gallon to over $2.05 a gallon in a matter of weeks.

There are three principles I would like to discuss at this hour of the evening. First is, when should we, the Congress of the United States, adopt an energy policy? When can we legislate dispassionately, not in response to an immediate emergency? Second, an energy policy for when? It makes a considerable difference if we are developing a policy for the next 10 years as opposed to what I think should be the more appropriate timeframe, at least the next 50 years, that we are legislating not for ourselves but for our grandchildren. And third, an energy policy should include a recognition of other affected issues--economic, environment, and more. A persistent problem in crafting energy policy is the fact that our willingness to act is greatest in the midst of a crisis, a disruption, or spikes in prices. History has repeatedly shown us that energy crises are the worst time to try to solve our problems. Short-term policy initiatives that deal with things such as market upheavals are often counterproductive. They respond to temporary circumstances. They might be political; they might be economic. They could even be climactic. California blackouts were the initial impetus for the energy legislation we have today. Those blackouts are now hopefully a thing of the past. Yet we now are casting this issue as how to respond to the threat from Saddam Hussein, that he will cut off supplies from Iraq. Even if there were silver bullets that the Congress could use to deal with these short-term energy disruptions, Congress often moves too slowly to shoot those bullets in the right direction to hit the right target. Long-term measures, such as promoting energy efficiency and launching new forms of energy production, don't have time to affect the market if these conditions are temporary. It would seem to me that the solution to this problem is both logical and obvious. The solution, however, goes against our natural inclinations. The time to address energy issues is between crises, when there is a better chance to do something that will actually work. If I could refer on this special day, the 54th anniversary of the establishment of the State of Israel, to an event which occurred in that region of the world and is recorded in the Book of Genesis. It is Joseph's interpretation of the Pharaoh's dream about 7 good years followed by 7 lean years. What Joseph's interpretation teaches us is that if we are going to deal with famine, the time to do so is not when the famine has commenced but, rather, the time to do so is during those years of plenty, to set aside for the lean years that will surely be ahead. The core of a wise energy policy is to avoid a focus on the here and now and look over the 50-year horizon. The focus should not be on us, the current generation but, rather, should be on the well-being of our grandchildren. An astute public official once said: That wise public official was Navy Secretary James Forrestal. And the date of his wise statement was 1946. Forrestal's statement was remarkable in several respects. First, he was looking beyond the next year to what would be happening over the next half century, setting a good example for the kind of thinking to which we should repair as we ask the question: What kind of an energy policy for America, for when? Second, James Forrestal suggests that we can't change the inevitable. We are not going to be able to produce our way out of the challenges created by our appetite for oil. If we were to take a 50-year view as Mr. Forrestal suggested, what are the challenges we must overcome? First, there is no likely scenario that will alter the reality that most of the oil consumed in the United States from today into the future will come from foreign sources. Shares of imported oil have been rising steadily for years. Proposals such as those before us in the past few days might slow this trend, but they will not reverse it. Second, we will likely see the need to dramatically reduce greenhouse gases that are the by-product of fossil energy use. There is definitive evidence that greenhouse gases impact our climate and our environment. Because greenhouse gases accumulate in the atmosphere and remain there for decades, or longer, we must commence action now in order to avoid unrestrainable consequences in the future. We must prepare by taking steps to ensure that strong, early action will avoid the need for drastic, expensive, and maybe unavailable steps when it is too late. Third, we must develop and utilize alternative fuels, both as a means of reducing our total fossil fuel consumption and the greenhouse gases which are an outgrowth of the use of fossil fuel. Alternatives are an important component of a diverse national environmental portfolio. They represent a solution to our dependence on fossil fuels and environmental problems associated with fossil fuels. Alternatives are critical in a policy that does not believe we should focus our energy goals on draining America first. I suggest that there are some opportunities in an enlightened energy policy for our Nation. There are three points contained in the energy bill upon which I believe we can all agree. I will point to these as the core of an intelligent energy policy. Point No. 1: We know we need to increase storage in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in order to provide a greater cushion against disruption in oil supplies. Since the price of oil fell in the mid- 1980s, we have missed many opportunities to build petroleum reserves at a time when we can do so relatively inexpensively. One reason may have been the false sense of security that the end of the Persian Gulf war brought in the early 1990s. During that period, we were able to replace the lost production from Iraq and Kuwait with only a minor release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Why did this seem to happen so effortlessly? Primarily because we were fortunate to have allies, such as the Saudis, increase their production. The Saudis have been good allies on numerous occasions, but do we really want to have an energy policy for the next 50 years that depends upon the good will of our allies and their own uninterrupted excess capacity? One of the positive aspects of the President's strategy for energy is his announced support for filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to its current capacity. This act alone will not solve our problems, but it is a good first step and should be implemented. A larger reserve will not eliminate our vulnerabilities, but it will reduce the economic impacts of disruptions and threats from abroad. Point No. 2: We must use the energy we have available as efficiently as possible. Energy efficiency cannot be accomplished in one giant step. It takes time for manufacturers to modernize their means of production. It takes even longer for equipment stock to turn over so that customers are buying the more efficient product. What we need is steady progress. This is a marathon, not a 100-yard sprint. We cannot rely solely on research and development. Low average energy prices in the United States limit the economic incentives to research and develop fuel-saving technologies. More broadly, the entire marketplace does not fully reflect environmental and long-term strategic concerns. In order to mitigate these realities, we have used efficiency standards for automobiles and appliances to achieve national goals. These standards have allowed us to make significant strides in reducing energy use. During the 1990s, while we made significant progress in some areas, such as the efficiency of refrigerators, we have moved backward in the area that is the largest consumer of fossil fuels, which is transportation. During this period, numerous technological advances for automobiles were introduced and widely implemented, such as airbags, crumple zones, and all-wheel drive. But none of these advances was aimed at increasing the efficiency, increasing the gas mileage of the vehicle. Now we are on the verge of additional technologies coming to the market, such as the electric hybrid vehicle which is making its debut to very promising reviews. Let's assure the American people that some of these technological advances will go to reducing the amount of money we spend on petroleum. In the appliances market, we can reduce the summer peak loads of electricity by insisting on greater efficiency for air-conditioners. It will take years for new, more efficient models to completely absorb the market. The sooner we start, the sooner we will begin to see the results. Point No. 3: We must increase the share of alternative sources of energy. If we try to do this all at once, the economic cost will be high. But if we opt for a steady progress toward greater use of alternative energy sources, we can expand our energy options and do so at a reasonable cost. We also must do this with flexibility. We are a diverse nation of States. Each State, each locale, has conditions that make it different from others. Those differences often impact on the ways in which States can participate in national initiatives, including the efforts to increase the use of alternative energy and thus reduce the reliance on fossil fuel. Point No. 4: We should strive for diversity in our energy sources. Renewables will contribute to that diversity. Another area that I believe has and, in the future, will contribute to that diversity is commercial nuclear power. It wasn't long ago that commercial nuclear power was providing 25 percent of our Nation's electric generation. Today, it is down to 20 percent and sliding lower. At the same time, that proportion of energy that used to be provided by nuclear is being provided by natural gas. While there are some compelling environmental reasons that natural gas is a","word.count":1921,"sep11":0.612359550561798,"years":2002.47191011236,"days":2660,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0780871149044647,"Topic 2":0.376800508184546,"Topic 3":0.00631720413873143,"Topic 4":0.403769806068413,"Topic 5":0.00965484566030017,"Topic 6":0.00264546278709351,"Topic 7":0.00533455679290645,"Topic 8":0.030967944196325,"Topic 9":0.0801372056190127,"Topic 10":0.00628535164820694},{"id":"11020080035474","body":"Shelley Berkley: I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his leadership on these important issues. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this bill to provide incentives for clean, renewable domestic energy production, to improve our energy security, and to extend provisions that provide vital tax relief to parents, teachers, college students, small businesses and millions of other middle class Americans. The energy provisions in this bill will allow my home State of Nevada to become an even stronger leader in the field of renewable energy. In a State that has a renewable energy standard and sunshine almost every day of the year, our entrepreneurs are anxious to secure the 8 years of solar energy tax credits contained in this bill, while our public utilities will finally be able to claim that credit as well. Instead of capping solar tax credits at $2,000 for residential property owners, this bill will allow home owners to recoup 30 percent of their solar energy installation costs as a tax credit. Solar is just one renewable energy source in this bill. There's also tax credits for wind, geothermal and biomass. The time is long past due for these important tax credits to be extended. This legislation also renews a number of expired individual and business tax credits, and will ensure that the residents of Nevada and other States that do not pay a State income tax are treated fairly and allowed to deduct State and local sales taxes instead. It's also important to note that the tax relief in this bill is fully paid for and will not add a single dollar to the national debt. Now, that's good fiscal policy. I urge support for this bill, and I urge the Senate and the President to do their part to enact this important legislation.","word.count":299,"sep11":7.2247191011236,"years":2009.08426966292,"days":5014,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.854901915543068,"Topic 2":0.0505810498077898,"Topic 3":0.00994401702330274,"Topic 4":0.0233678689343686,"Topic 5":0.0104626879195712,"Topic 6":0.0101512303739248,"Topic 7":0.00820325027376509,"Topic 8":0.0172309492340984,"Topic 9":0.0107074974169159,"Topic 10":0.00444953347319535},{"id":"10419950027222","body":"Collin C.

Royce: Thank you, Madam Speaker I would like to take this opportunity to recognize my alma mater, California State University, Fullerton as it celebrates its 50th anniversary. In 1957, California State University, Fullerton was founded by an act of the California legislature. The enrollment at that time consisted of 452 students when those first classes were offered in leased quarters at Sunny Hills High School prior to the college moving to the temporary buildings that became a permanent site in 1960 in Fullerton. Half a century after its founding, more than 185,000 graduates have successfully developed careers in hundreds of industries. Each year, more than 36,000 students attend classes at Cal State Fullerton, choosing from 105 different degree programs including 55 undergraduate, 49 graduate and a doctorate in education at eight distinct colleges: Arts, Business and Economics, Communications, Education, Engineering and Computer Science, Health and Human Development, Humanities and Social Sciences, and Natural Sciences and Mathematics, all of which provide an outstanding education to the students. Its studies have led students to careers in teaching, nursing, business, the arts, communications, health care, engineering, sports, the sciences and more. Cal State Fullerton graduates have gone on to successful careers and their impact is felt not only in the State of California and the Nation but throughout the world. Among these graduates are Academy Award-winning actors and screenwriters, television news reporters, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists, successful novelists, doctors, lawyers, judges, teachers, professional athletes, entrepreneurs, scientists and business leaders and even a NASA astronaut who served on the crew of the Space Shuttle Endeavor that launched into space in August of 2007. Cal State Fullerton's student body also reflects the diversity of the State of California. As one of the most diverse campuses in the State and in this Nation, the university welcomes students of different ethnic groups, cultures and religions. In fact, many of these students are the first in their families to earn a university diploma. The university received full accreditation from the Western College Association in 1961 and Cal State Fullerton now holds 14 national accreditations and associations. In addition, ``Titan Pride'' has been the rallying cry for 12 national team championships in seven different sports. Finally, Cal State Fullerton is known for its distinguished faculty, many of whom have garnered international and national reputations in their respective fields. It is with great pride that I recognize Cal State Fullerton for 50 wonderful years.","word.count":402,"sep11":6.66573033707865,"years":2008.52528089888,"days":4815,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.16037530618171,"Topic 2":0.436958394505421,"Topic 3":0.00903941756158811,"Topic 4":0.00623525187933698,"Topic 5":0.0170072499388048,"Topic 6":0.281970623919105,"Topic 7":0.0689043419694295,"Topic 8":0.00675531831479641,"Topic 9":0.0109308009075857,"Topic 10":0.00182329482222171},{"id":"10720010001528","body":"Nick Smith: Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California , the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Rules.","word.count":657,"sep11":-0.547752808988764,"years":2001.31179775281,"days":2247,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0572980324337869,"Topic 2":0.054581250598427,"Topic 3":0.508759881111537,"Topic 4":0.11834416171463,"Topic 5":0.0202592636879318,"Topic 6":0.00613864819187991,"Topic 7":0.00575152658472295,"Topic 8":0.19196923858573,"Topic 9":0.0126140287041041,"Topic 10":0.0242839683872497},{"id":"10820040009676","body":"John Larson: Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the University of Connecticut Men's and Women's basketball teams for this historic double championship wins in the 2004 NCAA Tournament. Today, thanks to men and women of the Huskies, Connecticut is a state of champions. Earlier this month, the nation learned what the people of Connecticut knew long ago: the skill and sportmanship of the UConn Huskies is the stuff of legends. After the ups and downs of the regular season, UConn went on to dominate the NCAA tournament and emerged as the first school to win both the men's and women's tournaments in the same season. On April 6, 2004, the Husky men brought home their second national title with an 83-72 win over the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. The next night, the Lady Huskies went on to beat the Lady Vols of the University of Tennessee, 70-61, fulfilling yet another historic achievement by being the second team to capture three consecutive national titles. This has been an unprecedented year for the Huskies, and Jim Calhoun, Geno Auriemma, Chris Dailey, Tom Moore, George Blaney, Clyde Vaughan, Andre LaFleur, Tonya Cardoza, Jamelle Elliot, Jack Eisenmann, and the entire UConn basketball program should be commended for their unmatched leadership and pursuit of excellence on and off the basketball court. Once again this year, the men and women of the Huskies have proven themselves to be the best players in the country. Players like Emeka Okafor and Diana Taurasi personify the skill, hard work and dedication it takes to succeed. I know that I join many UConn fans when I say that I look forward to watching Diana play for the Phoenix Mercury, and wish Emeka and Ben Gordon luck in the NBA draft this summer. The men and women of the UConn Huskies have long been a source of pride for the State of Connecticut. Their success is a reflection of the very best qualities of our student athletes, and will no doubt inspire young boys and girls in our state and across the country to achieve their goals. Not only do the huskies have the best players in the country, they have the best and most dedicated fans. For proof of this, one needs to look no further than the crowd of 300,000 excited UConn fans that lined the streets of Hartford for the Husky victory parade this past Sunday. The size of the crowd, roughly three times the city's own population, clearly demonstrates that the Huskies have a special place in the hearts and minds of the people of Connecticut. I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to the UConn men's and women's basketball teams and celebrating their success. They are truly a credit to their families, to their University, to the great state of Connecticut, and to the nation as a whole.","word.count":474,"sep11":2.71348314606742,"years":2004.57303370787,"days":3408,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0750618495159097,"Topic 2":0.443724992630819,"Topic 3":0.0221332590414405,"Topic 4":0.0129272797616803,"Topic 5":0.367674152139594,"Topic 6":0.0156492749838899,"Topic 7":0.0098206721086297,"Topic 8":0.0230513687182684,"Topic 9":0.0169373416002062,"Topic 10":0.0130198094995615},{"id":"11020080051873","body":"John Cornyn: Mr. President, I am pleased to come to the floor today to honor one of Texas' most famous leaders, President Lyndon B. Johnson. This year will mark the 100th anniversary of his birth, and the LBJ Foundation has chosen this week to honor his service to America in Washington, DC. Texas has a rich history of men and women--often from humble beginnings--who work to accomplish great things. Lyndon Johnson was no exception. Johnson was born near Stonewall, TX, nearly 100 years ago, to Texas legislator and poor farmer Samuel Johnson, Jr., and Rebekah Baines. Johnson was a natural public servant. In his early days he studied at then Southwest Texas University's teaching college. One of his first teaching jobs was at a small school in Cotulla Texas for Mexican- American children. His work with those students would forever shape his dedication to those in need. ``[They] had so little and needed so much,'' he once remarked. ``I was determined to spark something inside them, to fill their souls with ambition and interest and belief in the future.'' This eagerness to help others would be a noble and defining characteristic of Lyndon B. Johnson. While he spent time teaching at several schools across Texas, it was not long before Lyndon Johnson took his first foray into public politics. Johnson quickly worked his way through the Texas State Legislature and into the U.S. House of Representatives, and eventually into the U.S. Senate. The seat he took, I should note, is the same seat once held by another very famous Texan, Sam Houston. That same seat now carries a long and honored lineage, and it is my privilege to now serve in this esteemed seat. Early on, Senator Johnson made a name for himself as a man of action, who would work across the aisle to pass important legislation, and who held an incredible power of persuasion. He quickly became majority whip, and eventually majority leader of the Senate. I know that one of his greatest accomplishments in the U.S. Senate was the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1957--a landmark bill to help ensure the right of all people to vote. Of course, Johnson's legacy as a staunch defender of civil rights would not end there. Of course, Lyndon Johnson's presidency would come in the wake of national tragedy. Despite the conditions under which he took office, President Johnson helped console a nation in mourning, and ensure that America would recover--both physically and emotionally. President Johnson continued the same fervent defense of Civil Rights in America that he had begun early in his life. He helped enact the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the famous Voting Rights Act. At the same time, Johnson worked tirelessly to ensure a better education for all American children, and was a key proponent of NASA and the space race. Despite the turbulent times under which he served this country, President Johnson did his best to unite our country and promote a freer, more equal society. He will long be remembered for his great advances for the sciences, education, and civil rights--to name just a few accomplishments. It is my pleasure to stand today and honor President Johnson for his service, not only to Texas, but to our Nation as a whole. In his service to our country he never forgot the many Texas values with which he was raised, and as such he and his wife, Lady Bird Johnson, became iconic figures in Texas History.","word.count":581,"sep11":6.86516853932584,"years":2008.72471910112,"days":4886,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.641091859479308,"Topic 2":0.132262408484817,"Topic 3":0.075488192238429,"Topic 4":0.0144308143514637,"Topic 5":0.0126437886497523,"Topic 6":0.025821628236129,"Topic 7":0.00611825550350595,"Topic 8":0.0308596004576537,"Topic 9":0.0385733341291735,"Topic 10":0.0227101184697676},{"id":"10419960052540","body":"Barbara Boxer: Mr. President, I am not going to belabor the points that were made except to add my thanks to my ranking member, Senator Sarbanes, and my chairman, Senator D'Amato, for working this out with the able assistance of many people, particularly Senator Dodd.

We have had more days of hearings than the O.J. Simpson trial. The fact is, this has gone on endlessly. The people in California, and I cannot speak for the people of Connecticut or the people from Maryland or the people from New York, but I can say those who came to see me in this 2-week break, not one said, ``Senator, the one thing I want you to do when you go back is hold more hearings on Whitewater.'' Not one person. No Republican came up and told me that. They never even mentioned it. They did say, ``Go back and get the job done. Balance the budget. Pass a budget. Do not cut Medicare. Take care of education. Go after the situation in our exports where we have problems with nations who are not treating us fairly.'' I sit on the Banking Committee and we have that jurisdiction. We have not done a thing about the issues that will make life better for the people of this country. It is Whitewater, Whitewater, Whitewater. What do the people think of it? I tell you what they think of it, they think it is a waste of time. They think it is a waste of time. We have a special counsel who has no limit on what he can spend going after the truth on Whitewater. There is no statute of limitations. We had little discussion about that earlier in relation to another bill. This special prosecutor has the world at his fingertips, and yet we have to call up the same felons, the same felons that are spewing forth things against our President, we are going to bring them into the hallowed Halls of the Senate of the United States. People are smart. The American people get it. This Congress has a bad reputation among the people. They do not think this Congress is doing its job. No wonder. No wonder. So there are a lot of accolades about how great it is that we reached an agreement on this. I say, good, I am glad, because the alternative was having this in the Banking Committee where we would get nothing else done, and waste the time of the Banking Committee. I have a situation in California where we have a great industry which is the leader in CD's and laser disks. We are losing billions of dollars a year because of China piracy. What are we doing about it in the Banking Committee? Zero--no time. No time. I was encouraged when our chairman said that he agreed with me on this issue, and, yes, he will get that done. Well, that is good. I do not know how we will do it all, but my view has always been as long as there are allegations made on this floor that they have not unturned every stone, that I would vote to continue this, because the last thing I want is for people to think we are not willing to look. Yes, I would have voted for this, but I have to say I hope we are better in this phase than we have been before, because there were days when we were supposed to have hearings and no one showed up. I am here, and I know there is a lot of comity on the floor today and everybody is thrilled. I am not so thrilled. Yes, I will vote for it, but I think it is a waste of time. It is political. Everyone in the country knows it is political. They are smart. They know the special prosecutor is out there, and they see Members of the Senate act like prosecutors and staff sitting there like that is their job. If they want to be prosecutors, God bless them, be prosecutors. Do not be a U.S. Senator, and do not come to work for U.S. Senators, because we have other things to do. What we have to do is make life better for the people. It is embarrassing. It is embarrassing to me that I sit on one of the best committees in the U.S. Senate, and this is what we are going to be doing. I am glad we have an end date of June. We can wrap it up and do our work. I just hope we get back to the business of making life better for the people of our great Nation, because they deserve our attention. There is economic insecurity out there. There are things we can do in the Banking Committee to get to those issues. I stand ready to work in a bipartisan way to get to those issues and to move these hearings along. I also have to say just because I am straight from the shoulder about this, that when we have witnesses up there who are convicted felons, I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will not be surprised if I get a little tough in my questions.

Title IX of this legislation contains the ``Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998.'' This legislation, which requires coverage for reconstructive surgery following mastectomies, creates two new Sections in the Public Health Service Act--section 2706 which applies the requirement to health insurance issuers providing insurance coverage in connection with group health plans; and section 2752 which applies the same requirement to health insurance coverage offered by a health insurance issuer in the individual market. Section 2706 requires a health insurance insurer providing health insurance coverage in connection with a group health plan, that provides medical and surgical benefits with respect to a mastectomy to include in their scope of coverage: all stages of reconstruction of the breast on which the mastectomy has been performed; surgery and reconstruction of the breast to produce a symmetrical appearance; and prostheses and physical complication of mastectomy, including lymphedemas, in a manner determined under the terms of the plan or health insurance coverage in consultation with the attending physician and patient. Section 2752 requires a health insurance insurer in the individual market that provides medical and surgical benefits with respect to a mastectomy to include in their scope of coverage: all stages of reconstruction of the breast on which the mastectomy has been performed; surgery and reconstruction of the breast to produce a symmetrical appearance; and prostheses and physical complications of mastectomy, including lymphedemas, in a manner determined under the terms of the plan or health insurance coverage in consultation with the attending physician and patient. Additionally, since the act is effective with respect to plan years beginning on or after the date of enactment, it is expected that the Departments administering the act shall follow procedures under which no enforcement action will be taken with respect to a violation of a requirement imposed by the act on a plan or health insurance issuer before the date of issuance of final regulations, if the plan or health insurance insurers has sought to comply with the act in good faith. It is also the congressional intent that the agencies involved in issuing regulations will follow the same procedures under HIPPA as found in section 104 of the act.","word.count":405,"sep11":-2.96910112359551,"years":1998.8904494382,"days":1385,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.00835427693432766,"Topic 2":0.271190450085191,"Topic 3":0.00434651317278917,"Topic 4":0.00777836022700458,"Topic 5":0.00469827978883805,"Topic 6":0.0152343735182238,"Topic 7":0.649059865786827,"Topic 8":0.00384421788828783,"Topic 9":0.0332905577099544,"Topic 10":0.00220310488855619},{"id":"10419950143900","body":"Orrin Hatch: Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it stand in adjournment until the hour of 12 noon on Monday, December 11; that following the prayer, the Journal of proceedings be deemed approved to date, no resolutions come over under the rule, the call of the calendar be dispensed with, the morning hour be deemed to have expired, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day and there then be a period for the transaction of morning business until 1 p.m., with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each, and that at 1 p.m., the Senate resume consideration of Senate Joint Resolution 31.","word.count":119,"sep11":-5.91011235955056,"years":1995.94943820225,"days":338,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.171950131681552,"Topic 2":0.363070851052453,"Topic 3":0.004029096890397,"Topic 4":0.00925486400645772,"Topic 5":0.0106820883256685,"Topic 6":0.00423104004766607,"Topic 7":0.00621118755852632,"Topic 8":0.0324801240124036,"Topic 9":0.393530380775946,"Topic 10":0.00456023564892939},{"id":"11020070038765","body":"Fortney Pete Stark: Mr. President, it is a privilege to join my colleagues in support of the Gun Show Background Check Act to reduce gun violence. Closing this dangerous loophole in current Federal gun laws will make gun show transactions safer for all our people. Americans overwhelmingly favor responsible gun control laws. They want effective background checks for firearm purchases at gun shows or anywhere else. Yet, year after year, the ``gun show loophole'' allows firearms to be purchased with no questions asked, and legislation is urgently needed to close this flagrant loophole in our current gun laws. Under today's laws, licensed gun dealers must be approved, must register with the Federal Government, and must conduct background checks on gun buyers who come to their stores. But in most States, almost anyone can be an unlicensed private seller of guns. Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber, was one such private seller at gun shows. These private sellers have no obligation to conduct criminal background checks on buyers or keep any records at all about the sale. It is no surprise that felons and other prohibited gun buyers go to gun shows to buy guns in order to evade background checks. That is unacceptable. Closing the gun show loophole and requiring background checks for purchasers at gun shows is vital for public safety. The Gun Show Background Check Act defines gun shows as any event at which 50 or more firearms are offered or exhibited for sale and requires gun show promoters to register with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. It requires the promoters to maintain a list of vendors at all gun shows, and these vendors must acknowledge receipt of information about their legal obligations. It also requires that all firearm sales at gun shows go through a Federal Firearms Licensee. Private vendors and nonlicensed persons will be required to complete the sale of weapons using such a licensee, who will be responsible for conducting a background check on the purchaser and maintaining a record of the transaction. Finally, the bill improves the tracing of firearms by requiring these licensees to submit information about firearms sold at gun shows to the ATF's National Tracing Center. Approximately 50 percent of all gun sales in the U.S. today are ``private'' sales made by individuals at thousands of gun shows. No proof of identification and no criminal background check are required. Even after the horrific events of September 11, suspected terrorists and felons can easily purchase any quantity of firearms, including military style assault weapons, without an ID or background check at gun shows in 32 States. Federal law permits gun owners to sell rifles, shotguns, and even assault weapons to children, without their parent's knowledge or permission. It is not enough to leave this issue any longer to State action. As John Rosenthal, founder of the nonprofit organization, Stop Handgun Violence, has pointed out, Massachusetts has enacted some of the most effective laws to prevent gun violence in the country, but Massachusetts is surrounded by States, which have no such laws and allow individuals to buy and sell guns easily. According to ATF data for 2006, many of the gun crime weapons recovered in Massachusetts had been obtained in other States with little or no regulation of firearms sales. Critics claim that mandating background checks at gun shows will not reduce crime significantly and will be a step towards banning private firearms sales between individuals. Some even make the preposterous claim that there is no gun show loophole, and that gun control advocates are trying to address a non-existing problem. Evidence clearly proves, however, that gun shows are an important source of the guns used in crime in the U.S. During the late 1990s, cases involving gun shows and flea markets accounted for 30 percent of all trafficked guns in the U.S. That is no surprise, since there are over 4,000 gun shows in the U.S. every year, and no Federal laws to regulate them. Statistics also show that States such as Massachusetts, where strict gun control legislation has been enacted, have significantly lower firearm fatality rates than States with lax gun laws. In another appalling move, the Bush administration successfully pushed legislation requiring the FBI to destroy records of approved gun purchases within 24 hours of a completed background check. That action prevents law enforcement from identifying whether a person under investigation for another crime, including terrorism, has purchased a firearm. In addition, if federally licensed gun dealers fail to report stolen or missing guns, they face only misdemeanor charges, despite the fact that thousands of guns are stolen from gun stores every year. The rifle used by the DC sniper was ``lost'' by a gun store--the same store that ``lost'' 238 guns in 3 years. We can't ensure public safety unless we stop kowtowing to the gun lobby. We can't accept a system that allows criminals and terrorists to buy guns at gun shows without detection. The gun show loophole should have been closed long ago. I urge my colleagues to enact this vital legislation to do that. I commend Senator Lautenberg and Senator Reed for introducing this bill, and I look forward to its enactment into law as soon as possible. Too many lives are on the line for us to delay any longer.

He is a man with whom I have a great deal of agreement. But I think he was wrong when he said the rigid ideology of the people in power today leads them to the view, my way or the highway. I wish that were the case. Mr. Speaker, as you well know from your own committee position, the right wing ideology are on the point of saying, my way instead of the highway. Because so rigid are they in their right-wing ideology that we cannot even get a highway bill passed this year, as we certainly should, in the interest of the transportation needs of this country and the economy. But I want to talk beyond that about the work habits of the President. It is clear that in addition to an excessively rigid ideology we have an administration which is not very competent in a lot of things. I do not think we have seen a more incompetently executed national security policy of a major sort than Iraq in our history. And I wonder why we get such poor execution, even given that I disagree with some of the things they are trying to execute. Now it does become clear one of the problems may be the President's work habits. On December 16 in an interview on ABC News with Diane Sawyer, the President boasted about how he does not need to read the newspapers or, presumably, watch television. He gets his information, he says, from members of his administration. When Diane Sawyer said, ``Is it just hard to read constant criticism? He interjected, ``Why even put up with it when you get the facts elsewhere? I am a lucky man,'' the President said. ``I have got, it is not just Condi and Andy, it is all kinds of people in my administration who are charged with different responsibilities. And they come in and say this is what is happening, this is not what is happening.'' Well, Mr. President, you are being ill served by this refusal to get independent sources of information. You got a lot of people who confuse what is happening with what is not happening and sometimes they do not tell you anything. Most recently we have the Secretary of Defense who forgot to tell you that we had a major debilitating problem coming up with regard to the mistreatment of prisoners. And he did not tell you that. Last year, in what I think you consider to be, Mr. President, the single most important domestic accomplishment in the administration, did someone forget to tell you that the bill you were telling us was going to cost $400 billion over 10 years was, in fact, going to cost $540 billion and that all of the additional billion would go to the providers and none of it to the recipients? Did someone forget to tell the President or did the President forget to tell us? Then, of course, we have the comment by CIA Director George Tenet who told the President apparently that it was a slam-dunk that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Well, once again, we have a case on a very important issue of the President and, to quote his words, all kinds of people in my administration were charged with different responsibilities and they would come in and say this is what is happening and this is not what is happening. There is a serious problem, Mr. President. The time has come for the President of the United States to admit an error in this case, I know he does not like to do that, to admit that relying on Secretary Rumsfeld or CIA Director Tenet or Secretary Thompson or a whole range of other people to give him the information to brag about how he eschews independent, factual sources is a great mistake and may explain some of the serious mistakes this administration has made. Old sayings sometimes can be overdone. Sometimes they have some truth. There is a saying that ignorance is bliss. Well, Mr. Speaker, there may be context in which ignorance is bliss, but the Presidency of the United States is not one of them. The time has come for the President to acknowledge the fact that his method of getting information only from people within his own administration, who may have their own motives for misrepresenting or not giving him information that might be embarrassing to them, that that has broken down, and the time has come for the President to dip into the budget that he gets and buy a subscription to some newspapers and watch the TV news.

There is nothing in the article that is not accurate, but I think some things that are not included leave the impression that farmers of the United States are not good stewards of the soil. The premise of the article, according to the headlines ``Farmers' penalties rarely stick,'' is that under Federal law farmers must take certain action to conserve soil. If they do not conserve the soil and do it according to a plan, then they would be fined. And the article here is based on the premise that only a Government policeman from the U.S. Department of Agriculture is going to make the farmers conserve soil and that fines that might be imposed are the way of doing that because it says here that farmers' conservation fines rarely stick. The bottom line of the article is that farmers are not conserving soil, that Government regulation is the only thing that is going to make the farmers conserve the soil, and that there is not enough club on the part of Government because the fines in too many instances, according to the article, are forgiven. As I said, there is nothing inaccurate in that, but I have prepared remarks in which I want to give both sides of the story. We do have a Government requirement for farmers to participate in farm programs they must take appropriate action to conserve soil. There has been tremendous progress made in the conservation of soil, and it has come not because of Government fines that might be imposed against farmers but it comes because it is in the farmers' best interests to conserve soil because, quite frankly, the soil is very valuable but in the process of growing crops you put tremendously expensive chemicals and fertilizers on the soil. And when you have soil erosion and that soil washes into the streams, then obviously that investment to produce a bountiful crop goes with it. So it is to the farmers' advantage to keep the soil on their land. Over the past year, this body, along with our colleagues in the House, has engaged in a protracted discussion about the future of agriculture in the United States and how to best ensure a safe and stable food supply while providing an adequate safety net for farm families. The farm bill was passed and signed by the President very recently, which will be the safety net for the next 6 years. Now that we have done that, I would like to take a step back and address a concern that has been raised by many people I represent. For those colleagues who have never had the good fortune to visit my State of Iowa, I would like to take a moment to talk about this State. While we in Iowa may not be able to boast about majestic mountains or white sands on beaches along the oceans, my State has one natural resource to which I daresay no other State can compare--our rich, abundant, fertile topsoil. This resource has given birth to a deep-seated agricultural heritage in every corner of my state. In fact, each year communities across Iowa take to the streets to celebrate our rich heritage that comes from this rich natural resource, our topsoil. For example, the community of Conrad, IA, celebrates what they call ``Black Dirt Days.'' Gladbrook celebrates ``Sweet Corn Days,'' and the little community of Dike celebrates ``Watermelon Days.'' You can go on and on with examples of the people of Iowa worshiping our great natural resource. And no one in Iowa cares more about this rich heritage and our precious natural resources than the farm families who depend on the land for their livelihood and their way of life. That is why I was disturbed, as I already indicated to you, when the Des Moines Sunday Register on April 21 accused Iowa farmers of failing to take adequate steps to protect Iowa's soil and water. The article suggested that the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service Program, as well as the Farm Service Agency, both failing to adequately enforce Federal conservation rules, often let our farmers off the hook when conservation violations occur. The article suggests that the only way to achieve real conservation in rural America is for the Federal Government to carry a very big stick. Even more disconcerting, the article fails to address the significant conservation achievements that Iowa's farm families have already attained in terms of reducing soil erosion and reducing the use of nitrogen fertilizers by using it more efficiently. The Federal Government first significantly increased the prominence of conservation as a national priority in the 1985 farm bill. For the first time, that Food Security Act of 1985 required farmers to implement sound conservation plans on their farms as a condition for receiving Federal farm subsidies. We were not controlling the farmers' land, but we were saying in effect, through that bill, if they are going to benefit from the farm safety net, we expect everybody to be good stewards of their soil. More importantly, the 1985 bill also recognized the desire on the part of farmers themselves to protect the land on which they live and raise their families from abusive farming practices. The bill created the Conservation Reserve Program, sometimes called CRP, which allows farmers to take our countryside's most highly erodible land out of production. Since the 1985 farm bill, we have expanded the number of opportunities for farmers to voluntarily practice soil conservation programs. Today, farmers have a full arsenal of conservation tools at their disposal, including the Conservation Reserve Program, the Wetlands Reserve Program, the Emergency Watershed Protection Program, and the Wildlife Habitat Incentive Program, to name a few. The response to these programs by farmers and landowners has been overwhelming. Today, in Iowa alone, the farmers have enrolled 1.8 million acres in the Conservation Reserve Program, including 337,000 acres in the Continuous Conservation Reserve Program, which allows farmers to remove our country's most environmentally sensitive land from production. The Continuous Conservation Reserve Program helps farmers make significant conservation improvements on their land, including riparian buffers, grass waterways, filter strips, and windbreaks. In addition, Iowa farmers are aggressively working to restore our Nation's wetlands. Today, Iowa farmers have enrolled over 44,000 acres in the Wetlands Reserve Program. Wetlands provide a number of environmental benefits, as I am sure my colleagues understand. These wetland reserves help filter out nitrates that leech into the surface water from nitrogen fertilizers used by farmers to improve yields, as well as from naturally occurring nitrogen in Iowa's highly organic soil. They filter herbicides that seep into the ground, and they provide valuable habitat for Iowa's wildlife. As you can see, restoration of wetlands is important to all Iowans, both rural and urban. And that is not all. Iowa farmers have enrolled more than 60,000 acres in the Watershed Protection Program, and nearly 2,000 acres in the Wildlife Habitat Incentive Program. These programs have proven to be very successful. According to the Natural Resources Conservation Service, Iowa farmers cut soil erosion in half over the past two decades. We used to lose 10 tons per acre in 1982. By 1997, because of these conservation programs, we had cut that loss down to 5.3 tons per acre, and at 5 tons per acre, it is renewable. Moreover, according to the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, over 92 percent of Iowa's public water systems meet Federal drinking water standards. However, some critics of Federal conservation programs have asserted that the 1996 farm bill actually weakened conservation efforts. These critics may be interested to learn that throughout the duration of the 1996 farm bill, over 313,000 acres of conservation buffers have been built in the State of Iowa. In addition, over 106,000 acres of wetlands have been created, and there continues to be a waiting list of farmers who are eager to enroll fragile cropland in these programs, only kept from doing so because of the amount of money Congress will appropriate for these programs. It is important to keep in mind that sound conservation practices not only improve the environment in rural areas, but they also can play into the farmers' bottom line. Since 1996, Iowa farmers have increased the use of no-till planting. No-till planting leaves the residue from a previous crop on the ground, significantly reducing erosion. By not tilling the land, farmers reduce the number of trips across the field with their tractors, saving time, reducing the use of limited fossil fuels, and reducing harmful emissions into the air. In addition, technological advancements have improved the farmer's ability to care for land while improving yields. Today, for example, many farmers have turned away from the old method of applying fertilizer at an equal rate throughout the entire field. In fact, because of global positioning equipment, we can apply variable rates of fertilizer in different parts of the field in different quantities to save money, but not to waste fertilizer as well. One concern I have expressed about the 1996 farm bill is that it fails to incorporate effective payment limitations that would target Federal assistance to family farmers. Mr. President, the Senate has now passed the successor to the 1996 farm bill. This legislation should be the incarnation of our principles and our vision for the role we see America's farm families playing in the future. I was pleased that 64 Members of the Senate joined Senator Dorgan and me in a bipartisan fashion to ensure Federal payments are targeted to small and medium-sized family farmers who produce the food and fiber of our Nation. Our amendment would have helped curb the overproduction and target assistance to family farmers w","word.count":177,"sep11":-0.485955056179775,"years":2001.37359550562,"days":2269,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.883415881866393,"Topic 2":0.0384644709378131,"Topic 3":0.00824632919568498,"Topic 4":0.0202360276149292,"Topic 5":0.0082018962033426,"Topic 6":0.00862977639420071,"Topic 7":0.00644846547129333,"Topic 8":0.0145289624041237,"Topic 9":0.00827313607153153,"Topic 10":0.00355505384068828},{"id":"10419950055643","body":"John Lewis: Without objection, it is so ordered","word.count":382,"sep11":-6.05337078651685,"years":1995.80617977528,"days":287,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.388974279147322,"Topic 2":0.160936303560157,"Topic 3":0.0175368956750963,"Topic 4":0.011731195486714,"Topic 5":0.163299729365121,"Topic 6":0.0686550797836456,"Topic 7":0.00751075149031719,"Topic 8":0.160659220364698,"Topic 9":0.0100048874639685,"Topic 10":0.0106916576629603},{"id":"10920050050240","body":"Dick Durbin: Mr. President, Monday next is Memorial Day. Monday next, being May 29, my memory goes back to May 29, 1937. It was a Saturday. I was working in the meat shop as a meat cutter at the Koppers Store in Stotesbury, Raleigh County, WV. It was a coal mining community. I started working there in the gas station for Koppers Store for $50 a month. I walked 4 miles to work and 4 miles back home, unless I might catch a bread truck or a milk truck. But on that Saturday, May 29, 1937, at 5 o'clock p.m., my two senior meat cutters at the Koppers Store in Stotesbury, WV, and I closed up the meat department and went home. I put on my best suit--actually, my only suit--and where did I go? I headed off to Sophia, 4 miles away, to the house of the local hard-shell Baptist preacher U.G. Nichols. And there I met with my high school sweetheart, Erma Ora James. May God bless her sweet memory. She was the beautiful daughter of a coal miner. This was a coal miner who helped to teach me to play the old fiddle tunes long ago: ``Sally Goodin,'' ``Mississippi Sawyer,'' ``Arkansas Traveler,'' and ``She'll Be Comin Round the Mountain,'' and so on. At 6 o'clock that evening, Preacher Nichols pronounced Erma--God bless her sweet name--and me ``husband and wife.'' That union, I am very proud to say, endured for 68 years, 9 months, and 24 days. So on May 29, 3 days from now, Erma and I would have celebrated our 69th wedding anniversary. That is something to brag about. Dizzy Dean said it was all right to brag, if you have done it, and Erma and I did it. Erma didn't quite go all the way. But on May 29, Erma and I would have celebrated our 69th wedding anniversary. That is something not heard about very often these days, a 69th wedding anniversary. The Scriptures tell us that ``whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing and obtaineth favour of the Lord.'' Well, on that blessed day in 1937--a long time ago--I certainly found a good thing. In looking back on the life that Erma and I shared, I can say, in accordance with the scriptural passage, that I must have been favored by the Lord. ``The joys of marriage are the heaven on earth,'' wrote the English dramatist, John Ford, five centuries ago. How right John Ford was. When I think of Erma, I still think of the beautiful line from a song that I used to hear and play, I believe, when I played the fiddle: ``She came like an angel from the sky.'' For almost 69 years, this angel from the sky not only tolerated me, but she was the guiding light for me. She was my teacher. She taught me how to drive an automobile. She was my banker, my accountant. Very early in our marriage, as a matter of fact, on Sunday, the day after the Saturday evening on which Erma and I made our vows, I turned to her and said: ``Here is my wallet.'' I think I had saved up probably $300. I said: ``You keep it. When I need a dollar, I'll come to you and ask for it.'' That is the way it was, and that is the way it has been throughout our 69 years. What a job she did from the meager paychecks, and they were meager. Can you imagine. I started at $50 a month, and by the time I married, I had advanced. I was getting $70 a month when I married that sweetheart. She bought from this meager paycheck the things that we needed, our groceries. She paid the bills. She saved some money for a rainy day, and she gave me a monthly allowance. Erma was my greatest critic, and she was my greatest supporter. When I left the West Virginia Legislature to come to Congress, the other body, the House of Representatives, and this body, which also makes up the Congress, I was carrying 22 credit hours at Marshall College, now Marshall University, but she, Erma, managed our little grocery store. She took care of our two daughters, and she kept the home fires burning. When I was attending law school while serving in the U.S. Congress, she would drive from our home at that time in Arlington, VA. She would meet me on Capitol Hill here, around 5:30 p.m., and she would give me my supper. She brought it to me in a paper bag. I would eat my supper while Erma drove me in our car to American University Law School for my classes at 6 p.m. Then she would return later that evening, 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock, to pick me up and take me to our home in Arlington. I also said, quite truly, that Erma had put three kids through school: our two daughters and me. Erma was the mother of two most wonderful children, my daughters Mona Carole and Marjorie Ellen. Marjorie Ellen was here yesterday with me as we had lunch with some friends in recognition--one might call it celebration, but I call it in recognition--of our 69th wedding anniversary. These two daughters have grown up to become outstanding women and mothers themselves. Marjorie was here with me and with her husband, John Moore. Like me, those daughters owe so much to the marvelous and wonderful woman they called ``mother.'' Through the years, Erma was my constant companion. She was there with me, by my side, on the campaign trails. She was with me in 1958 when, as a Congressman, I made a tour of the economically depressed areas of the State and other parts of the country. She was with me in April 1969, in Mexico City, Mexico, when I served as a delegate to the Mexico-United States Interparliamentary Conference. She was with me on all my trips to Europe and Asia. She was always there. Erma was always there with me at my side. She is with me today, I know. For nearly 69 years, that woman, the greatest woman I ever met--I have met queens and great women of the world--was with me. She was always with me. She is with me now, I know. For nearly 69 years, she was my comfort in times of sorrow. She was stoic and brave. She never flinched in times of trouble. I quoted from the lines of Charles Jeffries, ``We Have Lived and Loved Together.'' This quiet, self-contained coal miner's daughter confronted demonstrators and protesters in front of our home in Arlington. She spent many evenings alone when I had to stay late at the Capitol attending the Nation's business. She always was most comfortable with the unassuming, down-to-earth West Virginia folks, back in the hills of West Virginia, like those back in the hills of Kentucky from which my friend, Senator Mitch McConnell, comes. She met with kings and shahs, princes and princesses, Governors and Senators, Presidents. She entertained the high and the mighty, the powerful and the wealthy of this Nation in a foreign land because it was important to her husband who served as the majority leader of this Senate and various other Senatorial offices. She did it all with an innate, inherent graciousness, incredible patience, and a soft, warm smile. She was a remarkable lady of great wisdom, but most of all, great gentleness, yet she could be tough when she saw injustice or unfairness. I was always so proud of her. In fact, the entire State of West Virginia took pride in Erma. That is why she was named West Virginia Daughter of the Year in 1990. Oh, could we call back the vanished years. And she was named West Virginia Mother of the Year a few years later. Marriage is a sacred institution. It is more than the result of repeating a few vows. Marriage is an oath, an oath before God. I have admired the ancient Romans so much, as did Montesquieu, because they would not break an oath. They would go to their death rather than break an oath. The ancient Romans. So marriage is an oath before God, a sacred and noble contract between a man and a woman. Read it in the Bible. It is a glorious commitment, a commitment of love, of caring, and of sacrifice. It is a commitment that Erma and I honored and enjoyed for almost 69 years, through the bad times as well as the good, down the rough roads as well as the smooth ones. Our life's journey was not always smooth and easy traveling. In fact, it was as bumpy at some times and as curvy as a West Virginia mountain road. But over the years, Erma and I learned that the challenge of a marriage is the ability to overcome imperfections, not just to ignore them. We always remembered our devotion to each other, despite our shortcomings and despite the difficulties we encountered along life's way. And when Erma and I married on that blessed Saturday evening nearly 69 years ago, we were so proud and we were so poor that I could not even take a day off from work. We did not have the money for a honeymoon, so after the wedding we went to a square dance, where I played the fiddle and she danced. On Monday morning, where was I? I was back at work in the grocery store in that coal-mining camp of Stotesbury. I was back at the meat counter in a coal-mining camp of Stotesbury. Although our fortunes did change, allowing us the opportunity to celebrate our anniversary in more special ways over the years, my Erma, my Erma never changed. She never changed. From being the wife of a meatcutter at the Koppers store in Stotesbury, WV, to being the wife of the majority leader of the U.S. Senate, Erma never stopped being herself. Her enduring patience and her steadfast support were the stabilizing constants in our marriage. Could I have made this journey without her? Could I have accomplished as much as I have accomplished--whatever that may have been--without her? I think not. The more important point is that I did it with Erma, and I would not have had it any other way. She was God's greatest gift to me. I don't know what I ever did to deserve her, but somewhere along the line, I must have done something that was especially good. The good Lord, the King, the Lord of Hosts, smiled down on me at 6 o'clock in the evening on May 29, 1937. So may I close with these few words that come from a poem, ``An Old Sweetheart of Mine,'' by James Whitcomb Riley. Mr. President, I simply say that I give thanks to Almighty God for a long and good marriage and the richness which that hallowed institution has given to my life because of one very extraordinary woman.

Let me just say this, and I didn't stay in a Holiday Inn Express last night, either. But let me just say this. As we continue on with the 30-somethings coming to a close, as we wait on our Republican colleague to come get his or her next hour, I just want to say that it is very, very important because this is very serious business. Sometimes here in the 30-something Working Group we spend a number of hours, I must say, Mr. Speaker, a number of hours not only studying before we come to the floor, of sharpening our tools and talking about what we are going to do, how we are going to do it, talk about the history of what we have done in the past, and talking about the legislation that is filed in this Congress. You heard Leader Pelosi. She said we have a minimum wage increase for the American workers at $7.25 already filed. It is not some saying, well, if we could or we are dreaming of a piece of legislation. It is already there. So when we talk about the first 100 hours to the Republican majority and to the American people, this is not something that we have to say, well, wait one second, wait one minute, we have to draw up some plans. They are already there. They are already there because the American people have said that they want it, overwhelmingly. And at the same time we talk about real security and securing America. It is not something where we are going to come up with some plan or some gimmick. It is already there. Taking the recommendations, you heard the leader, in the first 100 hours, the Democratic majority, the 10 uninitiated 9/11 recommendations that are vital to securing this country will be implemented. Like I said, as the ranking member of the Oversight Subcommittee of the Homeland Security Committee here in this House, Mr. Speaker, I have seen the schemes that have been brought about, that we are going to monitor the border and what have you. The American people want something more than monitoring. They want to secure the border, whether it be south or north. They want to secure it, not just monitor it. So let's just say, for instance, Mr. Speaker, that this new $2.5 billion initiative to monitor the border actually works. And the reality, Mr. Speaker, is the fact that the President, years after the 9/11 Commission report has been sent to the Congress and went to Barnes and Noble and Amazon.com and folks have copies of it, two or three copies of it, read it three times, still sends his budget to the Hill calling for 250 Border Patrol agents. If the Democratic amendments were adopted, Mr. Speaker, we would have over 6,000 new Border Patrol agents at 2,000 Border Patrol a year, as the 9/11 Commission called for. It was not that we went to the Democratic caucus and said, hey, let's just come up with a number of what we think should happen. We took the bipartisan recommendation from the 9/11 Commission. So like I said, the leader has already laid the foundation. The leader has come to the floor here in the p.m., a little bit before 8 p.m. eastern standard time, to deliver the message on behalf of the Democrats in this House that have the will and the desire to lead and said what we would do in the first 100 hours. So now that I know that our Republican colleague is here now, Mr. Ryan, I know that you were going to give the information out.","word.count":271,"sep11":4.15168539325843,"years":2006.01123595506,"days":3920,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0736295875947041,"Topic 2":0.481347662603752,"Topic 3":0.112719865372604,"Topic 4":0.0343430597437434,"Topic 5":0.0244678493329101,"Topic 6":0.0268682467297775,"Topic 7":0.0105783074377611,"Topic 8":0.0699011602118986,"Topic 9":0.0967644818714047,"Topic 10":0.0693797791014455},{"id":"10519980037115","body":"Jerrold Nadler: Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr. Speaker, I am going to ask for a vote on this motion because I understand the intent of the distinguished chairman when he says he will convey to the conferees, if we do not seek a vote, he will convey to the conferees our views on this matter, but he will also tell them it is not germane to the House bill. In other words, he will quietly seek, the majority will quietly seek to kill this amendment and we will never hear about it again. So I want a vote on this motion. This motion really shows what is going on here. Look at this chart here. We are told that the increasing number of bankruptcies is because middle-income and low-income Americans are generally deadbeats, that they are people of no character, that the moral stigma associated with welching on your debts is no longer around, people go bankrupt very easily. That is the whole basis for this unfortunate bill. Whereas in fact, we know that 15 years ago, in 1983, the average bankruptcy filer had debts, personal debts equal to 75 percent of his annual income. Today the average chapter 7 filer, the average bankruptcy filer has debts equal to 125 percent of his annual income. So today it is not that people are filing for bankruptcy as the first thing when they get into trouble. It is that they are in way over their heads. They are in way over their heads, and they do not file until they are absolutely desperate. Their debts are 125 percent of their annual income. The banks, having extended the credit recklessly, now want to do two things they want to do to the person who has gotten in over their head, because they keep throwing credit cards and credit at people who do not have that kind of income, they want us to crack down on bankruptcy so people cannot get out from under their debt. That is the chief point of this bill. Now they also want to say to those people who actually pay their debts on time, let us milk them for more money, too. If you have a credit card and you use it and you pay your bill in full on time every month, they are not making enough money off you. So they want and they are starting to say, we are going to cancel your credit card, or we are going to charge you a higher fee. And the Reed amendment says they cannot do that. They cannot charge a higher fee to someone who pays his debts in full each month than to someone who does not, and they cannot eliminate the credit card for that reason. It is not a sin to pay your debts on time. Look at that quote from the letter I read before from the bank, I forget which bank, to a creditor, You pay your debts on time and that is terrible. It costs us a lot of money. Let us look at this chart here. This chart shows the profitability of the credit cards as against the profitability of the banking system. Look at it here. The banking system's return on assets has averaged, since 1971, about 1 percent. Went down in 1987, with the stock market crash, to a little over, about a third of a percent and more recently was up at about 1.5 and 1\\2/3\\ percent, but about 1 percent. But look at the profitability of the credit cards. We all know what has happened to the credit cards. In the early 1980s, we deregulated the banks. We eliminated the interest rate ceiling on credit cards because in the late 1970s we had huge inflation and the interest rate was below the inflation level and the banks lost money for a couple years. So we said, no more limits. What happened? Well, the interest rates shot up. Interest rates on everything else, car loans, mortgages, cost of money to the banks has come way down, but the credit cards have stayed up there at almost 18 percent average. Do you know what the mortgage rate is today? It is 6.25 or 6.3 percent on a mortgage, on a 30-year mortgage. It is somewhat similar to single digits for car loans. But for credit cards, the average is 17.7 percent. So what happened to the profitability? Here is where we deregulated the interest rates. It went up to about 5 percent and for the last 17 or 18 years, it has stayed between 5 and 4 percent, most recent measurement about 4\\2/3\\ percent, 4 times, 3\\1/2\\ to 4 times higher than the general profitability of the whole system. So that banks are making out like bandits on the credit cards. They are making plenty of money. But it is not enough. After all, they have lent recklessly in foreign countries and we have got to really squeeze the American consumer to pay the banks back for what they have lost on investments in Russia and Argentina and other places. So let us squeeze the people. Those who got into, got in over their heads, who have debts amounting to more than 100 percent of their annual income and are filing for bankruptcy, let us pass this bill. Let us spend $40 million in campaign contributions and lobbying to pass this bill to enable us to really squeeze these consumers and make it harder for someone in over his head to go bankrupt and, for those who go bankrupt, make it harder for them to get out of it. But that is not enough. Quite separate from this bill, let us tell those terrible people who actually pay their debts on time every month, we do not want your business, because we are not making enough money off you. We are making real money. The 2 percent interchange fees on these charges equal $60. The average cost of servicing the account is $25. It seems to average, my arithmetic tells me, a $35 profit per year without any interest. But that is not enough. They are using the ability to cut off people from credit or to impose extra fees for the sin of paying their bills on time. This amendment, Mr. Speaker, does not, unfortunately, deal with the other evils in this bill, but this amendment, which the Senate voted for, which is in the Senate version of the bill, simply says a creditor may not solely, because a consumer has not incurred finance charges in connection with an extension of credit, one, refuse to renew or continue to offer the extension of credit to that consumer; or, two, charge a fee to that consumer in lieu of a finance charge. That is the entire amendment. So we will have a vote on the floor. Let the American people see who in this House thinks that the banks should be able to gouge in this way the debtor who pays his debts on time and who does not. I urge the Members of this House to vote for this motion to instruct the conferees to agree to the Senate amendment and it will show us who cares about consumers, at least a little, and who only cares about the profitability of the credit card companies. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.","word.count":1243,"sep11":-3.03089887640449,"years":1998.82865168539,"days":1363,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.108908700129889,"Topic 2":0.0500874122506407,"Topic 3":0.0039857693554223,"Topic 4":0.010255333074296,"Topic 5":0.00312441787813331,"Topic 6":0.00605721648829495,"Topic 7":0.0232215508827717,"Topic 8":0.00952831344320383,"Topic 9":0.782070765934756,"Topic 10":0.00276052056259222},{"id":"10419960085822","body":"Patrick Leahy: Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senate is today taking the important step of passing the Economic Espionage Act and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act of 1996 [NII Protection Act]. The NII Protection Act, which I have sponsored with Senators Kyl and Grassley, was sent to the House as S. 982, after passing the Senate unanimously on September 18, 1996. The NII Protection Act has come back to the Senate for final passage as part of a package of bills including H.R. 3723, the Economic Espionage bill. These bills are complimentary. The economic espionage bill will impose criminal penalties on those who steal valuable trade secrets from the U.S. Government and those doing business in our country, without regard to the means used to effect the crime. Spying on American companies in order to obtain their trade secrets and confidential proprietary information is--to put it bluntly-- stealing. Although the estimates of how much this stealing costs our Nation's business and our economy are rough, the range is in the billions of dollars per year. Unfortunately, the problem appears to be growing. The increasing dependence of American industry on computers to store information and to facilitate communications with customers, suppliers and farflung subsidiaries, presents special vulnerabilities for the theft of sensitive proprietary information. I have long been concerned about this vulnerability. That is why I worked with the Department of Justice, and my colleagues, Senators Kyl and Grassley, on introduction of the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act. This bill will increase protection for computers, both government and private, and the information on those computers, from the growing threat of computer crime. Our dependency on computers and the growth of the Internet are both integrally linked to people's confidence in the privacy, security, and reliability of computer networks. I have worked over the past decade to make sure the laws we have in place foster both privacy and security, and provide a sound foundation for new communications technologies to flourish. Both the NII Protection Act and the Economic Espionage Act reflect significant efforts to better protect our industrial lifeblood--the imaginative ideas and the special know-how that give American companies the edge in global competition. The NII Protection Act will help safeguard the privacy, security and reliability of our national computer systems and networks and the information stored in, and carried on, those networks. Those systems and networks are vulnerable to the threat of attack by hackers, high- technology criminals and spies. Every technological advance provides new opportunities for legitimate uses and the potential for criminal exploitation. Existing criminal statutes provide a good framework for prosecuting most types of computer-related criminal conduct. But as technology changes and high- technology criminals devise new ways to use technology to commit offenses we have yet to anticipate, we must be ready to readjust and update our Criminal Code. The facts speak for themselves--computer crime is on the rise. The week before Senate passage of the NII Protection Act, on September 12, a computer hacker attack, which shut down a New York Internet access provider with thousands of business and individual customers, made front page news, and revealed the vulnerability of every network service provider to such an attack. The morning after Senate passage of this legislation, on September 19, computer hackers forced the CIA to take down an agency Web site because obscenities and unauthorized text and photograph changes had been made to the site and unauthorized links had been established between the CIA Web site and other sites. The Computer Emergency and Response Team [CERT] at Carnegie-Mellon University reports that over 12,000 Internet computers were attacked in 2,412 incidents in 1995 alone. A 1996 survey conducted jointly by the Computer Security Institute and the FBI showed that 42 percent of the respondents sustained an unauthorized use or intrusion into their computer systems in the past 12 months. While the NII Protection Act may not address every form of computer crime or mischief, it closes a number of significant gaps in the computer fraud and abuse statute. This legislation would strengthen law enforcement's hands in fighting crimes targeted at computers, networks, and computerized information by, among other things, designating new computer crimes, and by extending protection to computer systems used in foreign or interstate commerce or communications. For example, while our current statute, in section 1030, prohibits misuse of a computer to obtain information from a financial institution, it falls short of protecting the privacy and confidentiality of information on computers used in interstate or foreign commerce and communications. This gap in the law has become only more glaring as more Americans have connected their home and business computers to the global Internet. This is not just a law enforcement issue, but an economic one. Breaches of computer security result in direct financial losses to American companies from the theft of trade secrets and proprietary information. A December 1995 report by the Computer Systems Policy Project, comprised of the CEO's from 13 major computer companies, estimates that financial losses in 1995 from breaches of computer security systems ranged from $2 billion to $4 billion. The report predicts that these numbers could rise in the year 2000 to $40 to $80 billion worldwide. The estimated amount of these losses is staggering. The NII Protection Act would extend the protection already given to the computerized information of financial institutions and consumer reporting agencies, to computerized information held on computers used in interstate or foreign commerce on communications, if the conduct involved interstate or foreign communications. The provision is designed to protect against the interstate or foreign theft of information by computer. Computer hackers have accessed sensitive Government data regarding Operation Desert Storm, penetrated NASA computers, and broken into Federal courthouse computer systems containing confidential records. These outside hackers are subject to criminal prosecution under section 1030 of the computer fraud and abuse statute. Yet, this statute contains no prohibition against malicious insiders: Those government employees who abuse their computer access privileges by snooping through confidential tax returns, or selling confidential criminal history information from the National Crime Information Center [NCIC]. The NCIC is currently the Nation's most extensive computerized criminal justice information system, containing criminal history information, files on wanted persons, and information on stolen vehicles and missing persons. I am very concerned about continuing reports of unauthorized access to highly personal and sensitive Government information about individual Americans, such as NCIC data. For example, a ``Dear Abby'' column that appeared on June 20, 1996 in newspapers across the country carried a letter by a woman who claimed her in-laws ``ran her name through the FBI computer'' and, apparently, used access to the NCIC for personal purposes. This published complaint comes on the heels of a General Accounting Office [GAO] report presented on July 28, 1993, before the House Government Operations Committee, Subcommittee on Information, Justice, Agriculture, and Transportation, on the abuse of NCIC information. Following an investigation, GAO determined that NCIC information had been misused by ``insiders''--individuals with authorized access--some of whom had sold NCIC information to outsiders and determined whether friends and relatives had criminal records. The GAO found that some of the misuse jeopardized the safety of citizens and potentially jeopardized law enforcement personnel. Yet, no federal or state laws are specifically directed at NCIC misuse and most abusers of NCIC were not criminally prosecuted. GAO concluded that Congress should enact legislation with strong criminal sanctions for the misuse of NCIC data. This bill would criminalize these activities by amending the privacy protection provision in section 1030 and extending its coverage to Federal Government computers. If the information obtained is of minimal value, the penalty is only a misdemeanor. If, on the other hand, the offense is committed for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain, for the purpose of committing any criminal or tortious act in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States or of any State, or if the value of the information obtained exceeds $5,000, the penalty is a felony. The current statute, in section 1030, protects computers and computer systems from damage caused by either outside hackers or malicious insiders ``through means of a computer used in interstate commerce or communications.'' It does not, however, expressly prohibit the transmission of harmful computer viruses or programs from abroad, even though, a criminal armed with a modem and a computer can wreak havoc on computers located in the United States from virtually anywhere in the world. This is a significant challenge in fighting cybercrime: there are no borders or passport checkpoints in cyberspace. Communications flow seamlessly through cyberspace across datelines and the reach of local law enforcement. Indeed, we have seen a number of examples of computer crimes directed from abroad, including the 1994 intrusion into the Rome Laboratory at Griffess Air Force Base in New York from the United Kingdom and the 1996 intrusion into Harvard University's computers from Buenos Aires, Argentina. Additionally, the statute falls short of protecting our Government and financial institution computers from intrusive codes, such as computer ``viruses","word.count":1947,"sep11":-5.07022471910112,"years":1996.7893258427,"days":637,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.156873763757064,"Topic 2":0.0249253813429177,"Topic 3":0.0143557989669375,"Topic 4":0.078359999689423,"Topic 5":0.38127124761334,"Topic 6":0.00696682535513242,"Topic 7":0.00609764946333385,"Topic 8":0.0496722181685524,"Topic 9":0.27447913147216,"Topic 10":0.00699798417113929},{"id":"10620000027802","body":"Rush Holt: Mr. Speaker, we certainly should have the opportunity to debate this and vote on it on the floor. It takes away no local authority. The local school authorities will determine what needs to be built and where it needs to be built and when it needs to be built, but I know in my district, many of the towns have difficulty justifying to the taxpayers the large increase in property taxes that would result from the necessary school construction. Now, this is not a free lunch. Of course, what we are doing in effect is deferring Federal revenue, but in the case of the school districts in central New Jersey it would be a shift away from property taxes, which would allow school districts to get on with the school construction that they know, that we all know, that they need to do. I think it is a very attractive concept. I only wish, as my colleague says, that we could get this to the floor to be debated as it should be. The gentleman has been a real leader in advancing this idea and I think this will find favor all across the country. One other thing I would like to comment on is technology education, science education, and the importance of teachers. I think one of the greatest disservices that we do to students and to teachers is sometimes when people will talk about a born teacher, so and so is a born teacher, there are no more teachers born than there are born lawyers, born doctors, born engineers. When we talk about it that way, we lose sight of the fact of what hard work it is to be a teacher, and how a teacher must work to keep up with developments in their field and developments in learning, learning how children learn. So that if we are going to invest in the children of this country and in their education, we must invest in the professional development of teachers. In most businesses, it is customary to spend several percent, maybe 5 percent, maybe 10 or even 20 percent of salaries in the training and development of the employees. In the field of education, in schools, that is typically 1 percent or less that is invested in the professional development of teachers. We must recognize that teaching requires continuous learning, continuous development, so that teachers can be the professionals that we want them to be. In the area of technology, our cars now have more computing power than the Apollo spacecraft had. Computers can send billions of dollars of capital around the world at the touch of a key, and our economy is booming with growth in high-tech industries, and yet a recent survey published by the Department of Education tells us that only 20 percent of teachers feel qualified to use the technology that is now available to them. Not some future technology that is coming but what is available to them today. That is why I am cosponsoring legislation to help teachers teach technology education. We must do more. In order for our country to continue growing and prospering in this century, we must ensure that our students receive a quality education in science and mathematics and technology. We must do what we can to help the teachers be prepared to teach those subjects.","word.count":559,"sep11":-1.16292134831461,"years":2000.69662921348,"days":2028,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.141709872772482,"Topic 2":0.409456678898646,"Topic 3":0.0481066293172718,"Topic 4":0.262652749178465,"Topic 5":0.00923029374684598,"Topic 6":0.00484913358808528,"Topic 7":0.0370415426256878,"Topic 8":0.00843316890394485,"Topic 9":0.052801543318772,"Topic 10":0.0257183876498002},{"id":"10820040026367","body":"Todd Akin: Mr. Speaker, I have heard a number of people saying today that this is not about the institution of marriage. It most certainly is about the institution of marriage. It is also how marriage is going to be defined. I somehow cannot get my mind around the concept that the Founders' idea was that a bare majority in one State court and a bare majority in the Supreme Court can redefine the word of marriage and shove that down the throats of 49 other States. Somehow that does not seem to make sense. The Democrats here have been suggesting that the Supreme Court should be totally sovereign in every decision, and that one also I find rather puzzling, because the first foray of activist judges on the Supreme Court was that brilliant decision of Dred Scott, which said that African Americans are not actually people. Now, if every decision of the Supreme Court is gold, how about this one? And what was the result of this little act of activism? Well, they are the wonderful folks who gave us the Civil War. I just cannot understand the logic of saying and talking about the idea of separation of powers and checks and balances and at the same time say, anything the Supreme Court says goes. That is what I am hearing argued today. The question is when the Supreme Court gets really goofy, and my friends, we can pick how goofy is goofy, but when they really start legislating from the bench, at what point and what is the mechanism to hold them in check? Well, whose job is it? Well, it has been made reference to here. We take an oath of office to uphold the Constitution. It is our job, my friends, as legislators, and it is the job of the President, who also seeks to uphold the Constitution. Now, there is one other thing that has been stated that some staffers probably should be let go, because they have not done their homework. Because if we take a look in the 107th Congress alone, we can take a look and see that the expedite, the construction of the World War II memorial has article III, section 2, the American Service Members Protection Act. Article III, section 2 language, Aviation Security Act. This is all 107th Congress alone. PATRIOT Act, article III, section 2 language. Intelligence Authorization Act, article III, section 2.

The question before us is a question of whether or not a redefinition of marriage is going to be imposed on all of our States by a few activist judges. Believe me, the answer should be no.","word.count":482,"sep11":2.93539325842697,"years":2004.79494382022,"days":3487,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.140501997651075,"Topic 2":0.347983317190177,"Topic 3":0.00565140026429842,"Topic 4":0.362266792137525,"Topic 5":0.00491821839421972,"Topic 6":0.00227245531840298,"Topic 7":0.0341833306321494,"Topic 8":0.00515136190071267,"Topic 9":0.0816778456765136,"Topic 10":0.0153932808349259},{"id":"10519980050561","body":"Kent Conrad: Mr. President, I submit an amendment to S. 1133, the Parent and Student Savings Account Plus Act. The amendment that I am offering today would extend tax credits to businesses that train workers in information technology skills. The credit would be equal to twenty percent of the information training expenses provided by a company; however, these expenses could not exceed $6,000 in a taxable year. The percentage of the credit would increase by five percent to twenty five percent for a business that operates a training program in an empowerment zone or enterprise community, a school district where fifty percent of students are eligible for the school lunch program, or in an area designated by the President or Secretary of Agriculture as a disaster zone. This amendment would be paid for by reducing the top of the phase-out range of the education IRA to $90,000 for joint filers and $75,000 for individuals. The intent of my amendment is to encourage businesses to retrain current employees who may be about to be discharged, to retrain unemployed workers, and to encourage businesses to enter into partnerships with schools, job training programs or universities to train students and workers in computer and information technology skills. As I noted earlier, a higher tax credit would be extended to a business that establishes a training program or partnership in an area where unemployment or poverty is high. Mr. President, several months ago--January 12, 1998--Vice President Gore, while meeting with information technology executives in California, announced a series of Administration actions to meet the growing demand for information technology workers. The Vice President cited reports by several federal agencies including the Department of Commerce, that the demand for computer scientists, engineers, and systems analysts will double over the next decade. Industry spokesmen representing the Information Technology Association of America confirm that the current shortage of information technology workers is approximately 346,000. This shortage includes programmers, systems analysts and computer engineers. For the information technology industry this shortage is threatening the competitiveness of U.S. companies. As ITAA President Harris Miller commented in January, ``Technical talent is the rocket fuel of the information age. As an information-intensive society, we cannot afford to stand by as the next wave in our economic future departs for foreign shores. Empty classroom seats, a poor professional image, and other factors are conspiring to rewrite an American success story. We must solve this problem''. Mr. President, this matter is critical for the IT industry as further evidenced by a hearing held last month in response to industry concerns over this critical shortage of workers. The hearing focused on the need to amend current immigration law to raise the annual cap--currently set at 65,000--for temporary visas for highly skilled workers. This may be a short term solution to the IT worker shortage; however, it is not the long term answer to this problem. American workers and students must have opportunities to learn these new skills whether through partnerships, education or retaining programs. Mr. President. That is the purpose of my amendment--to encourage more opportunities for American students and workers in the IT field. I hope that my colleagues will support this critical amendment. We can no longer rely on merely adjusting immigration quotas to meet the skilled IT worker shortage.","word.count":546,"sep11":-3.57865168539326,"years":1998.2808988764,"days":1168,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.617962588734747,"Topic 2":0.0803090198638799,"Topic 3":0.0480893874630973,"Topic 4":0.0441175124773031,"Topic 5":0.0582490345103671,"Topic 6":0.0186325829876753,"Topic 7":0.0157416307879288,"Topic 8":0.0884830909270849,"Topic 9":0.020243297293911,"Topic 10":0.00817185495400614},{"id":"11020070035983","body":"Marcy Kaptur: Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform be discharged from further consideration of the concurrent resolution recognizing the important social and economic contributions and accomplishments of the New Deal to our Nation on the 75th anniversary of legislation establishing the initial New Deal social and public works programs, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.","word.count":128,"sep11":6.01685393258427,"years":2007.87640449438,"days":4584,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0185174311411798,"Topic 2":0.100043356682819,"Topic 3":0.264391475635589,"Topic 4":0.00841380802127103,"Topic 5":0.0123897569585421,"Topic 6":0.0314283478940926,"Topic 7":0.0181195665911195,"Topic 8":0.0432855762516562,"Topic 9":0.498626011522149,"Topic 10":0.00478466930158243},{"id":"10720020035748","body":"Dick Durbin: Madam President, today I have introduced a new bill along with Senator Mike DeWine, a Republican from Ohio, and Senator Russ Feingold, a Democrat from Wisconsin, which intends to address the U.S. response to the scourge of conflict diamonds. In war-torn areas in Africa, rebels and human rights abusers, with the complicity of some governments, have exploited the diamond trade, particularly alluvial diamond fields, to fund their guerrilla wars, to murder, rape, and mutilate innocent civilians, and kidnap children to be part of their guerrilla forces. Since November, the press has reported a connection between al-Qaida operatives and conflict diamonds. Those connections were noted in advance of the September 11 attack. It stands to reason that when we have a terrorist organization and a country such as the United States in concert with its allies trying to trace the financial transactions that fund this terrorism, the terrorists will look for some other coin of the realm, some other way to fund their operations. Conflict diamonds turned out to be one of the most easy, portable, and least detected way to do it. It is quite clear that Hezbollah, another terrorist organization in the Middle East, has had a long history of dealing in conflict diamonds. While the conflict diamond trade comprises anywhere from an estimated 3 to 15 percent of the legitimate diamond trade, it threatens to damage an entire industry worldwide, an industry that is important to the economies of many countries and critical to a number of developing countries in Africa. How does it work? The terrorists go into the diamond fields where the natives of West Africa are trying to find these alluvial diamonds in the streams and the mud as they used to pan for gold in California and Alaska. They terrorize the local natives. They line them up in a row and walk through and hack off their feet and their hands until the natives and the miners in the circumstance are absolutely terrified. They threaten them with mutilation, with rape, and torture, destroying their villages and their lives. They literally become slaves to these terrorists, who then grab the diamonds and sell them into the terrorist networks. Governments, the international diamond industry, and nongovernmental religious organizations have worked hard to address this complicated issue. They have set an impressive example of public and private cooperation. For the last 18 months, many countries involved in the Kimberly Process have been working to design a new regimen to govern the trade in rough diamonds. About 70 percent, by some estimates, of all the diamonds that are mined and found in the world are sold in the United States. The United States needs to show a leadership role in dealing with conflict diamonds so the terrorists know it is not going to be easy. We are going to make it more difficult. We are going to try to establish controls so we know if diamonds were brought into the trade by illegal or legal means. Last year, I introduced a bill called the Clean Diamonds Act, S. 1084, along with Senators DeWine and Feingold, to reflect the consensus that had developed between the religious and human rights communities and the diamond industry on the U.S. response to this issue. Senator Judd Gregg, who had introduced his own amendments and legislation dealing with this issue in the past, joined in cosponsoring our bill, as did a bipartisan group of 11 additional Senators. In the House of Representatives, Congressmen Tony Hall and Frank Wolf have been leaders on this issue. They introduced several bills to address it. They worked with the Ways and Means Committee and the administration to pass the bill last November, H.R. 2722, the Clean Diamonds Trade Act, which, while a step forward, I am afraid, did not do enough to meet the original intent of our congressional effort. I had hoped Senator DeWine, Senator Feingold, and I might be able to work out an agreement with the administration to make some changes to strengthen the House-passed bill, but unfortunately that has not happened. In the meantime, the international effort is continuing. Talks that we hope will one day lead to a final session of the Kimberly Process are underway today, tomorrow, and Wednesday in Ottawa. I am concerned key issues remain unresolved or have been addressed in ways that could undermine the whole initiative, leading to the failure to produce an effective Kimberly agreement. Specifically, the negotiators need to address the issues of independent monitoring, the collection of reliable statistics, and the need for a coordinating body to implement the agreed-upon system of controls on rough diamond exports. In addition, the U.S. General Accounting Office, in its February 13 testimony entitled ``Significant Challenges Remain in Deterring Trade in Conflict Diamonds,'' outlined other potential witnesses in transparency, accountability, and risk assessment, particularly relating to controls from the mine to export. We have decided we need to introduce a new, stronger Senate version of the Clean Diamonds Trade Act to move this issue forward and to address developments such as the revelations about terrorist exploitation of diamonds and the potential weaknesses in the international agreement. Think about these diamonds moving across the world. You can put a fortune in your hand, put it into your pocket, and walk through any metal detector undetected. You can carry them on an airplane around the world, use them as people would use gold ingots or checking accounts. They are fungible wherever you go. Our bill includes a broad definition of conflict diamonds, so it covers the conflicts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, not simply areas that have been singled out by the United Nations Security Council resolutions. Our definition also covers the terrorists named by President George Bush in his Executive Order 13224. The House bill does not give the authority to the President that he has already under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and has already in fact exercised to implement existing U.N. Security Council resolutions, nor does the House bill require the President to do anything to respond to this problem. Our bill requires the President to prohibit the importation of rough diamonds from countries not taking effective measures to stop the trade in conflict diamonds if that prohibition is in the foreign policy interest of the United States. It is clear to me those responsible for the conflict diamond trade will stop at nothing in their efforts to circumvent the international efforts being negotiated. To transform a rough diamond into a polished diamond for purposes of import classification, all someone needs to do is make one cut. That distinction in the House-passed bill is a terrible loophole. The importation of polished diamonds or jewelry containing diamonds is a potentially huge loophole as well through which conflict diamonds could have been imported into the United States. The House-passed bill did not protect against that loophole. The House bill also does not require but only permits the President to prohibit the importation of specific shipments of polished diamonds or jewelry containing diamonds into our country, if he has credible evidence they were produced from conflict diamonds. Our bill requires it. Our bill also permits the President to prohibit the importation of polished diamonds and jewelry containing diamonds from countries that do not take effective measures to stop the trade in conflict diamonds. With these two provisions, we hope to send a strong message that the United States will close the polished diamond and diamond jewelry loopholes so that American consumers can have confidence that the diamond they buy for an engagement, an anniversary, or another milestone in their lives is from a legitimate and responsible source. Finally, our bill eliminates the safe harbor provision contained in the House bill which would allow circumvention of the Kimberly Process before an agreement were even finalized. While these negotiations are proceeding and while we are trying to secure the cooperation of all parties concerned, this is not the time to undercut it. The world was shocked and horrified by the murder, mutilation, and terror imposed on the people of Sierra Leone by rebels funded with conflict diamonds. The moral outcry by religious and human rights groups galvanized governments and the diamond industry to address the problem. Now is the time to close the deal and to secure an effective agreement, not an exercise in public relations. Now is also the time to have strong U.S. legislation to say to the world the United States will do as much as it can to stop this scourge. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.","word.count":1441,"sep11":0.528089887640449,"years":2002.38764044944,"days":2630,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0544580783669052,"Topic 2":0.0676069183904957,"Topic 3":0.536328830829712,"Topic 4":0.0262178628205885,"Topic 5":0.0156013556832114,"Topic 6":0.0564134015189902,"Topic 7":0.00638756911650079,"Topic 8":0.158005522900453,"Topic 9":0.0589725174291729,"Topic 10":0.0200079429439705},{"id":"10419950058961","body":"Maxine Waters: I appreciate the Chairman's willingness to look more closely at this issue.

I remember the very first day that the gentleman from Iowa and I discovered that Bruce Vento had incurred cancer. And we talked and we said that Bruce Vento is a very, very special person and we ought to do something very special for him. This is the least we can do. I love Bruce Vento. I sat next to him for almost 24 years. There are so many things that I could say about him, but maybe more than anything else, Bruce Vento cared. He was a caring, loving human being. He cared about our poor. He cared about our underprivileged. He cared about equal justice. He cared about preserving the beauty of our natural resources. He cared about the rights of consumers. He cared about the future of our Nation's youth. And it is difficult to say what he cared about most. But very possibly he might have cared most about our homeless. And each of these issues, each of these causes has lost a great friend. Bruce Vento was a great leader, a tireless champion of the poor and the homeless; and he brought such tremendous compassion, intellect, vision, dedication, persistence, tenacity to the work of writing our Nation's laws. It has also been written that all of this to be genius must be accompanied by good sense. And Bruce Vento had good sense which made him a genius of both a person and a legislator. The bill before us today, cosponsored by each and every member of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, both Democrat and Republican and countless other Members of this House, would rename the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act. It is fitting to Congressman Bruce Vento's tireless commitment to the homeless. We will pass this today. I hope it will become law in this Congress. For 24 years, Bruce was a tireless champion and advocate on behalf of homeless people. And he wrote many if not every law that brings compassion and comfort to our homeless, to our poor and destitute. Traces of his tireless commitment can be found on any forgotten street in urban America. His commitment can be found in a shelter where families go for a hot meal. His commitment can be found in a vacant building that has been converted into a place where the homeless can find a bed and a roof over their heads. There is so much more I would like to say, but so many others wish to speak on this bill and on Bruce's behalf, too. I just want to say one thing. He was blessed, too, with a great staff; and I came to know two of them in particular, Larry Romans and Kirsten Johnson-Obey, and so much of Bruce's legislative record was only possible because of their great ability and work, too. They represent the best of what congressional staff can be, and I know that Bruce looking down on us would feel it very important that we make that statement, too. I urge everyone to support this bill and honor Bruce. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.","word.count":385,"sep11":-1.96629213483146,"years":1999.89325842697,"days":1742,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.129798967684964,"Topic 2":0.222822929120349,"Topic 3":0.0233413806450641,"Topic 4":0.0766852533984075,"Topic 5":0.0452142918191494,"Topic 6":0.0092828007139306,"Topic 7":0.0952148660676968,"Topic 8":0.0416034503731971,"Topic 9":0.0177303664203353,"Topic 10":0.338305693756906}]

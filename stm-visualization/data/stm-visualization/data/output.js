Kerry: Madam President, 4 years ago today, as we know, the President stood on an aircraft carrier underneath a banner that read ``Mission Accomplished.'' He declared that the major combat operations in Iraq were over. When he spoke those words, 140 American troops had been killed in Iraq. Since then, over 3,200 more American troops have given their lives. Just today, we learned that April was the deadliest month this year, with 104 Americans dead. With every passing day, it becomes more obvious that the President really should have said: My fellow Americans, major combat operations in Iraq are just beginning. On that day, he should have had a plan to match the rhetoric with reality. But we are where we are, as the saying goes, and it is even more tragically clear to all but a few that if we want to accomplish our mission in Iraq--and we all do--if we want an Iraq that has any chance of stability and some sense of democracy, any sense of it, we have to change course. In the past 4 years, we have lost at least 3,342 of our best young men and women, and nearly 25,000 others have been wounded and many wounded severely. We have spent nearly $400 billion, and the cost is rising at a rate of over $2 billion per week. There is no end in sight. ADM William Fallon, the top U.S. commander in the Middle East, recently said: And even General Petraeus, the top commander in Iraq, now says that we can expect the situation to get worse before it gets better. We were treated to a spectacle a week and a half ago with news reports, a front-page story, I think, in the Washington Post, that Stephen Hadley, the President's security adviser, was casting about to find a general to be the sort of supreme organizer, if you will, of the war in Afghanistan and the war in Iraq. What struck me about that story is here is our Nation at war, here is a series of four-star generals whose lives are committed to Nation, to service, to duty, and to military, who under normal circumstances would be honored to be asked to become the point person to organize our Nation's efforts in two wars in a front that is of serious consequence to this Nation. Yet all four retired four-star generals said no. One was even quoted publicly as saying they don't know what the hell they are doing, or they don't know what direction they are going in. That is a pretty remarkable statement for a career military person to make about the current effort. But we also know the history of what has brought us here with retired generals--a whole host of them--who publicly rebelled postservice against the leadership of Secretary Rumsfeld, who is now gone. It is a rather remarkable statement about the lack of planning, about the lack of candor, about the scapegoating that has gone on, about the unwillingness of people's careers to be judged not by their ability to tell the truth but, rather, their willingness to tell the civilian leaders what they want to hear. As we know from our own intelligence agencies, the war in Iraq has increased the threat of terrorism by creating a breeding ground for terrorists that didn't exist before the invasion and by serving as a rallying point for extremists around the world. In fact, the State Department's annual terrorism report released yesterday shows that terrorist attacks worldwide were up 25 percent last year after increasing nearly fourfold the year before that. How does the leadership come to the country and suggest that this war is accomplishing our larger goals? How does it help the war on terror to be creating more terrorists? How can you tell the American people we have made you safer, when the number of terrorist incidents have gone up and the number of terrorists who want to kill Americans is larger today than it was on 9/11? Any businessperson, any tourist, anybody of any curiosity who has traveled abroad and who has asked a few simple questions or read the newspapers and listened to the news knows that our Nation, which we love passionately, is now less followed, less listened to, and less feared--less listened to by our friends and less feared by our enemies. The fact is, we are less safe as a result. We are less unified at home, less respected abroad, and we are less strong as a result. Obviously, there is no way we can make up for what has happened in the last few years, certainly not in terms of the lives lost and the pain and suffering endured by those wounded and by families who have suffered those losses, but the fact is, we can find a responsible strategy to try to deal with not just Iraq but the whole Middle East and, indeed, releverage America's position in the world. The President today, tonight, is going to veto crucial funding for the troops passed by both Houses of Congress, legislation that gives our soldiers all they need to complete the mission and receive the care they deserve once they get home. The President is going to veto it, but that is not all he is going to do. Then he is going to try to pin the blame on those who have pushed for a new direction. He is going to try to pin the blame for his failures, for his lack of planning, for his lack of leadership on those who are providing the only way to try to resolve what is happening in Iraq. Instead of pressuring Iraqi politicians, this administration is practicing the politics of division at home, a brand of American sectarianism that undermines our national unity, a unity required to make decisions in time of war. Last week, Vice President Cheney accused Senator Harry Reid of putting politics ahead of our national security. I suppose we have grown used to this Vice President, who has pioneered the politics of fear, who oversaw the politicization of the intelligence used to mislead the country into war, who claimed that we would be greeted like liberators, who told us the insurgency was in its last throws, who continues to insist that everything is on track and growing fine, I think we have grown used to this Vice President not being candid with the American people. Clearly, he didn't hesitate to impugn the integrity of the Senate's majority leader who is standing for an appropriate new direction with respect to our policy in Iraq. Certainly, we can disagree about those tactics or strategies without impugning the motives and challenging the integrity of those who speak those different possibilities. If the President insists on continuing down the wrong path, it seems to me Congress has no choice but to be as resolute in demanding the right path forward for our troops, for our country, and for the Iraqis themselves. I believe we have to continue to fight for the legislation that gives us the best chance of bringing our troops home with some measure of success in the region. Four years after ``mission accomplished,'' it is time for us to acknowledge the implications of what General Petraeus and every other military commander, the Secretary of State and even the President have told us. All of them have said there is no military solution to the violence in Iraq. I don't know how many times I have heard that on Sunday shows, I hear it out here in the corridors with individual Senators talking to the press. Everybody mouths the words: ``There is no military solution.'' But if there is no military solution and we are all agreed on that, then what is the military doing? Why is the military and an escalation in the number of troops so critical if there is no military solution? The administration, even after telling you there is no military solution, then gives you a rationale for a military solution, which is: We have to put additional troops in to have the security, in order to have the compromises. But the fact is, the security which, first of all, is proving illusive and probably impossible to secure with the troops alone, cannot be secured without the political compromises. This is a classic chicken-and-egg situation: Which comes first? You are not going to get the security until the stakeholders in this civil struggle feel confident enough that what they are struggling about can be resolved to their safety and future security. That is sort of a fundamental issue. You are not going to change the on-the-ground security situation and stop people from bombing and militias from killing unless those fundamental stakes are properly addressed and defined. It is long since time that we started to measure progress on the ground in Iraq by the one metric that will ultimately determine our success or our failure, and that metric is this: Are the Iraqis making the tough political compromises necessary to keep their country together? It has been nearly a year since the Maliki Government took power. At that time, General Casey and Ambassador Khalilzad said that the Maliki Government had 6 months to make the political compromises necessary to win the public confidence. So here we have the commanding general of our forces and our trusted Ambassador to Iraq both saying they have 6 months to make the compromises. But guess what. The 6 months went by and nothing happened--nothing happened in Iraq to make those compromises happened, and nothing happened afterwards because the compromises didn't happen. That sends a message that there is no consequence to delay, there is no consequence to procrastination. After that, the Iraqi Government agreed to a set of benchmarks because people were growing frustrated and those benchmarks, guess what, were pegged to specific dates for making progress toward national reconciliation. In January, the President announced the troop escalation, and he told the American people the following: But, once again, no real consequences, no real leverage, no real diplomacy. The result is, those benchmarks proved meaningless. You can take a look at the benchmarks the Iraqis agreed to. What did they agree to do at that point in time? October 2006, over 6 months ago, that was the deadline for Iraqis to approve a new oil law and a provincial election law.

Some of the most environmentally sensitive pipeline facilities are cable suspension bridges that convey pipelines above rivers and canyons. As a former state highway commissioner, I strongly believe that it is critical to maintain the approximately 4,000 pipeline bridges in this country or we will face the prospect of having to bore underground to replace this essential part of our infrastructure. It is important to clarify that cable suspension pipeline bridges have unique qualifications in addition to other pipelines that must be addressed to ensure safety through regular maintenance and inspection. Pipeline safety legislation under consideration today requires that the operators and inspectors be properly trained to inspect all pipeline facilities. It is imperative that the inspectors of these pipelines possess specialized knowledge to properly determine the structural integrity and soundness of the cable suspension bridge that supports the pipeline as well as the pipeline itself. Such knowledge should include an understanding of and training in: steel fabrication, structural engineering fundamentals, pipeline behavior under operating pressure, the characteristics of all cable types used in suspension bridges, and the characteristics of reinforced concrete foundation structures. It will be required through this bill that the Office of Pipeline Safety's technical experts, in conjunction with the industry, develop specific plans to ensure the integrity and safety of all pipelines. These regulations will ensure that all pipelines, including cable suspension pipeline bridges, are properly maintained and inspected to ensure the highest safety standards possible.","word.count":253,"sep11":-1.98314606741573,"years":1999.87640449438,"days":1736,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.159346713096449,"Topic 2":0.600085550301101,"Topic 3":0.0605739904378051,"Topic 4":0.0684727056848259,"Topic 5":0.0321737499273161,"Topic 6":0.00721562704028121,"Topic 7":0.0103515247255785,"Topic 8":0.0108249236742155,"Topic 9":0.0364099029353931,"Topic 10":0.0145453121770342},{"id":"11020070102194","body":"Sherrod Brown: Mr. President, I thank Senator Coburn for his cooperation on an important issue with Senator Schumer, something this body needs to move on. I thank both Senator Schumer and Senator Coburn. I wanted to talk about the same issue this morning for 5 or 6 minutes. Thousands and thousands of families in Ohio are struggling to keep a roof over their heads during the upcoming Christmas season. My State has been in the grip of a mortgage crisis at some level for years, which shows no signs of letting up. Ohio is faced with one of the highest foreclosure rates in the country. Our largest cities are being particularly hit hard. Ohio's six biggest cities are among the 30 hardest hit in the Nation. It looks as if things may get worse before they get better. What we do in Washington, or what we fail to do here, will have a profound effect on families in Akron, Cincinnati, Toledo, Columbus, and Cleveland. It is not just my State's largest cities; it is Portsmouth, Lima, and my hometown of Mansfield, Zanesville, Ravenna, and Marion. Every day, over 200 families in Ohio lose their homes. A month ago, the majority leader, Senator Reid, sought to bring up a bill that would modernize the FHA home loan program. Our colleagues on the other side objected, claiming they had not had sufficient time to read the bill. Mind you, this wasn't a bill written in secret. It passed out of the Banking Committee 20 to 1 in September after a long process that fully involved the ranking member, Senator Shelby, a Republican of Alabama, and all of my colleagues on the Banking Committee. By making improvements in the FHA program, more families would be able to refinance out of their unaffordable subprime loans and into fair, more equitable, and affordable FHA loans. As the Wall Street Journal found in an analysis published last week, many subprime borrowers had pretty good credit when they took out their loans. Many should have been in conventional loans, but in too many cases they were steered into higher priced loans, loans more profitable for the mortgage broker, but more costly, and ultimately disastrously so, for far too many borrowers, new homeowners. Many of them should be able to take out FHA loans that won't have those exploding adjustable rates. We all went home for Thanksgiving, and when we came back, Senator Reid tried again, and again our Republican colleagues objected. President Bush announced last week a plan that may help a small slice of the population. He called on Congress to adopt FHA reform. Good for him. But what he needs to do is call on his fellow Republicans to stop obstructing every single attempt we have tried to help homeowners in Ohio and across the country. There may be progress today in the conversation between Senators Schumer and Coburn. That is our hope. Most of the people who work in the mortgage industry have their clients' best interests at heart. They rely on repeat business and word-of-mouth advertising. But as the industry has evolved, it seems as though more and more market participants are acting in ways that are at odds with their clients' interests, all for short-term and sometimes huge profits. Some mortgage brokers have chosen to prey on the most vulnerable--the poor, the elderly, and the family one paycheck away from disaster. Their conduct is unforgivable. Borrowers who may not have been particularly sophisticated when they took out a loan are very likely going to be unfamiliar with how to navigate their way out of a bad situation. They are going to need a lot of help, and the network of nonprofit organizations across the country is going to be of vital importance in providing that help. Congress approved $200 million. Senator Schumer and Senator Casey and I worked to put that money into the legislation to provide this help. But the President has threatened to veto that legislation. We also need to do what we can to prevent the situation from getting worse. Mortgage brokers and originators have to exercise care in how they do business. At a bare minimum, they should be sure a borrower can repay a loan, and they need to do so based on real verification rather than a wink and a nod. Nobody is doing anybody a favor by convincing them to take out a loan that will become unaffordable in 2 or 3 years, or that doesn't include the payment of taxes and insurance. No longer should the dreams of Ohioans and new homeowners across the country fall victim to the fine print. No longer should Congress turn a blind eye to the despicable practices that victimize our neighbors and our communities because foreclosure in one house affects the homes all over that neighborhood. We have tried to provide tax relief to people who have had some of their mortgages forgiven by their lender when they sell their house for less than their outstanding loan. Right now, any amount of debt forgiven is considered income, slapping additional tax burden on a family who has gone through the trauma of losing their home. But that provision is imperiled by end-of-year obstructionism as well. Not one Republican supported Senator Reid's effort to force an end to the Republican filibuster of the tax bill that included this provision. Everything we have tried to do to help homeowners--from counseling funds, to FHA reform, to tax relief--has been blocked by Republicans. If President Bush is serious about helping homeowners, he will bring this to an end. The people of Ohio have waited too long for relief. They need our help. They need it now. I yield the floor.","word.count":955,"sep11":6.41292134831461,"years":2008.27247191011,"days":4725,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.056233964172865,"Topic 2":0.369513900149272,"Topic 3":0.00824514357337101,"Topic 4":0.0135100036642798,"Topic 5":0.0206854296211636,"Topic 6":0.00530392969957369,"Topic 7":0.00782433483671324,"Topic 8":0.102953365492298,"Topic 9":0.0355086955751817,"Topic 10":0.380221233215281},{"id":"10519980017401","body":"Joseph Kennedy: Mr. Chairman, first of all, I want to thank my good friend the gentleman from Massachusetts for the hard work that he and the gentleman from Massachusetts , and the gentleman from New York and others have done on this bill. This is the kind of legislation where I had hoped to be able to come to the floor and support the overall bill that was being generated in order to deal with a real problem in this country, where all too often very, very wealthy and powerful individuals and corporations use the bankruptcy laws to essentially hide from their responsibilities of paying their debts. I see it time and time again in my work on the Subcommittee on Housing and Community Development and seeing landlords that are completely unscrupulous declare bankruptcy, suck out section 8 subsidies time and time again, year in and year out, abuse the system and do so with a bunch of sophisticated lawyers and beat the taxpayer and beat their obligations to society. I want to support a bankruptcy bill, but this bankruptcy bill is flawed. This bankruptcy bill is flawed because it does not look out after not the rich and powerful, but it does not look out after the working families and the poor. I rise in support of the Democratic substitute. As we debate this bill, I am reminded of the casino scene in Casablanca with Inspector Renault. After a decade of credit card companies literally throwing trillions of unsolicited credit cards at consumers, luring them in with teaser rates and easy credit and then slamming consumers with 20 percent and higher interest rates and creative new fees, the credit card industry pretends to be shocked, shocked to find a rise in personal bankruptcies. Before Congress enacts the credit card industry's wish list to go after the bankrupt poor and middle-income debtors, it is critical that we hold the credit card industry accountable for practices that they have spawned: a doubling of credit card debt over the course of the last 6 years, and a 50 percent increase in credit card delinquency rates. The Democratic substitute addresses some of these concerns about credit card practices in dealing with dischargeable credit card debts. Before we enact bankruptcy reform, I also believe that we should reform the reckless credit card practices of easy credit, high interest rates and creative new fees, new fees such as teaser rates. We should require better disclosure of the permanent rate of teaser rate come-ons. Checks, we should mandate stricter control over unsolicited mailing of high interest rate credit card accounts masquerading as checking accounts. And rate increases, we should codify the right, existing in 20 States, to cancel a credit card and pay it off under existing terms and conditions when rates are arbitrarily raised. But the most egregious credit card practices, which should be outlawed, are those which actually provide a financial incentive for credit card holders not to pay off their debt. The first is the so- called GE fee, a fee charged on card holders simply because they pay their charges on time in full each month. The other is the action, first seen only last year, of canceling credit cards of only those card holders that paid their debt in full on time. I offered an amendment to outlaw these two practices, but the Republicans refused to even allow it to be debated. It is outrageous that an industry that wants relief from bankruptcy should discriminate against people who pay off their debt simply because credit card companies cannot make obscene profits off of them. The credit card and banking industries are currently making record profits. Do not bail out the credit card companies until they clean up their act.","word.count":626,"sep11":-3.33988764044944,"years":1998.51966292135,"days":1253,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0720215961763203,"Topic 2":0.231366967284621,"Topic 3":0.00912325950035009,"Topic 4":0.130174084232977,"Topic 5":0.0408768446573675,"Topic 6":0.00321624215635073,"Topic 7":0.143853683693205,"Topic 8":0.0227542022063884,"Topic 9":0.157733191459451,"Topic 10":0.18887992863297},{"id":"10519970005928","body":"Marcy Kaptur: Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure have until midnight, Wednesday, March 25, 1998, to file a report to accompany the bill to authorize funds for federal-aid highways, highway safety programs, transit programs, and for other purposes.","word.count":153,"sep11":-4.51685393258427,"years":1997.34269662921,"days":834,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.00660771904575735,"Topic 2":0.041104154687247,"Topic 3":0.0114509120277319,"Topic 4":0.00782015142026483,"Topic 5":0.00172265707999874,"Topic 6":0.00227976295779683,"Topic 7":0.603615546799196,"Topic 8":0.00451423362629189,"Topic 9":0.319498937877575,"Topic 10":0.00138592447813958},{"id":"10820030076822","body":"Fritz Hollings: I would like to discuss an issue to be voted on in the morning, a resolution of disapproval of the FCC, increasing 35 to 45 percent ownership, and, more than that, the cross-ownership at the local level.

Last year's severe drought and locust infestation destroyed most of Niger's harvest and the fodder necessary for keeping livestock. As a result, an estimated 3.6 million people including 800,000 children under the age of 5--are now facing starvation. Aid workers in the field describe the situation as desperate, and report that children are dying daily and families have turned to a diet of acacia leaves and grass. I urge the administration to continue to respond and to work with other donors to ensure Niger's humanitarian needs are met. In particular, it is crucial that USAID make certain the recently announced $7 million in additional emergency funds go immediately towards alleviating the hunger in the hardest hit areas: the agro- pastoral regions of Maradi and Tillaberi and the pastoral regions of Tahoua and Zinder. Reportedly, there is a shortage of therapeutic feeding centers and clinics, and weakened villagers cannot manage the travel required to reach them. We also need to address long-term food security issues in the Sahel, where drought and famine regularly afflict these poorest nations. Earlier this year I traveled to three of Niger's neighbors--Algeria, Mali, and Chad. I heard firsthand accounts of how devastating the locust crisis was, and I heard a consensus regarding the need for permanent mechanisms to facilitate crisis response and to prevent emergencies in the future. As the tragedy in Niger demonstrates, even when governments, international organizations, and NGOs are able to anticipate food insecurity almost a year in advance and implement their assistance programs, we can still have a crisis. Unfortunately, it sometimes takes media coverage of already emaciated children to jolt donor countries into emergency action. We need to remain alert and responsive to World Food Program appeals for extra funding before the starvation begins, and we need to stay committed to long-term efforts to improve food security throughout the region.","word.count":331,"sep11":3.97752808988764,"years":2005.83707865169,"days":3858,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.134437027757418,"Topic 2":0.0529854698887127,"Topic 3":0.0281320670688252,"Topic 4":0.621921712199973,"Topic 5":0.0391229142777202,"Topic 6":0.0906197214278359,"Topic 7":0.00371090404770682,"Topic 8":0.0206696059790519,"Topic 9":0.00398299923407364,"Topic 10":0.00441757811868271},{"id":"10920050029985","body":"Timothy Bishop: Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX and the Chair's prior announcement, further proceedings on this question will be postponed.","word.count":365,"sep11":4.15449438202247,"years":2006.01404494382,"days":3921,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0355374356967842,"Topic 2":0.141411646559919,"Topic 3":0.00294125243520263,"Topic 4":0.0149537753732311,"Topic 5":0.00597351769229067,"Topic 6":0.00227843955142002,"Topic 7":0.00356955366022178,"Topic 8":0.128734196427532,"Topic 9":0.168809834490281,"Topic 10":0.495790348113118},{"id":"10519980070636","body":"Kit Bond: Madam President, this amendment responds to the critical requirement of enhancing antiterrorist activities at the Federal Emergency Management Agency. In our budget hearings with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Senator Mikulski and I raised the question of whether this country is ready to respond and take all appropriate actions to deal with the threat of terrorist activities in our country. The administration has submitted a budget amendment on June 8 to increase spending in several agencies for antiterrorism activities, including $11 million more than the original budget request for FEMA's emergency planning and assistance. With this amendment we will meet the request. The bill as reported by the committee adds $3 million above the initial request for such activities, and this amendment now pending before the Senate would add another $8 million, for a total of $11 million in this key area. These funds are to be used for such critical activities as planning at the Federal, State, and local level for the unique aspect of terrorist-related incidents. I note this is part of a larger proposal for $249 million to strengthen our ability to defend against and respond to terrorist incidents involving the use of biological or chemical weapons. I wholeheartedly support this effort. I think it is vitally important and I think this is a vital first step. In a recent self-assessment by the States, they rated themselves as being unprepared in this critical area. The funds we are adding today should go a long way in helping State and local governments prepare for these instances that we hope they never have to face. But, as in all emergency management agencies' activities, we have to be prepared for things that could happen that we hope never happen. With this amendment, FEMA funding would total almost $18 million. The FEMA program, as I said, complements a broader initiative involving the Department of Defense, Department of Justice, and the Department of Health and Human Services. That effort includes building a civilian stockpile of antidotes to respond to any large-scale attack, improving the public health surveillance system, and providing special equipment to first responders. We have already included in this bill assistance for first responders in dealing with a problem that is particularly acute in my State of Missouri, and that is the explosion of methamphetamine clandestine labs in our State. We have recognized in this bill the need to prepare first responders--emergency personnel, firefighters, police--when they go into a methamphetamine lab. These are very dangerous facilities that can blow up with any kind of heat or light, or even the discharge of a gun. So we recognize that the people who do the vitally important work responding to emergencies, whether they are firefighters or police or sheriffs units, the first responders as they are often called, need to be prepared. In this amendment, we are going to provide additional assistance to the people who will come on the scenes first. These are very frightening issues. The terrorism issue--we have already experienced domestic acts of terrorism in Oklahoma City and at the World Trade Center, so we know they can occur. We need to be prepared. We need to make our country as safe as possible. It is all too easy to ship weapons of mass destruction, be they explosives or chemical or biological weapons, even in a suitcase. This risk is not acceptable, and I strongly support the amendment as an important first step towards dealing with these problems. Our country has to be prepared to protect its citizens from the dangers of a hostile world. Unfortunately, the constant threat we face from rogue states makes it vital that Congress provide the funding for FEMA to use towards counterterrorism measures on a local level. Our amendment gives FEMA the funding it needs to enhance the training of emergency personnel in the event that a terrorist attack occurs. Madam President, I urge adoption of the amendment and I yield the floor to my colleague.","word.count":663,"sep11":-3.26685393258427,"years":1998.59269662921,"days":1279,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.00927556831863307,"Topic 2":0.0248437983024424,"Topic 3":0.00834344434689239,"Topic 4":0.0165221384402646,"Topic 5":0.00525718844004736,"Topic 6":0.0416669669396916,"Topic 7":0.812699084331573,"Topic 8":0.0695426448898892,"Topic 9":0.00712586369226118,"Topic 10":0.00472330229830538},{"id":"10820030086964","body":"Jon Kyl: Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Advancing Justice Through DNA Technology Act of 2003.'' This bill consists of the President's DNA initiative, which will expand and improve DNA databases used for criminal investigations and authorize additional funds to clear the backlog of untested DNA evidence in the nation's crime labs. This bill offers several advantages over another version of the President's proposal that recently was introduced in the Senate. Today's bill gives States greater leeway in the use of DNA grants, removes arbitrary and unnecessary restrictions on the testing of criminal suspects' DNA samples, authorizes additional funds to clear the backlog of non-DNA forensics evidence, and--most importantly avoids tying this critical program to unrelated and highly controversial anti- death penalty legislation. I include in the record at the end of this statement a news story that describes the nature of the state counsel and other extraneous provisions that others have sought to attach to the President's proposal. The bill that I introduce today is an unencumbered--and unabridged-- version of the President's DNA initiative: the DNA Sexual Assault Justice Act and the Rape Kits and DNA Evidence Backlog Elimination Act, which authorize the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program and provide $755 million over five years to address the DNA backlog crisis in the nation's crime labs. Today's bill includes the following improvements over other congressional versions of the President's proposal: First, this bill also expands funding for non-DNA forensics funding. Section 211 of the bill authorizes $100 million in new grant programs to eliminate ``the backlog in the analysis of any area of forensic science evidence, including firearms examination, latent prints, toxicology, controlled substances, forensic pathology, questionable documents, and trace evidence.'' Second, this bill increases the authorization for the Paul Coverdell grant program, in recognition of the fact that this program never has been funded at more than a small fraction of its authorization. Other congressional versions of the President's DNA initiative only authorize decreasing Coverdell funding in the coming years. This bill resets the clock on the Coverdell program, authorizing 2004 funding at the level for 2001, and subsequent years accordingly. This will allow sharp increases in Coverdell funding in the coming years. Third, today's bill allows states to test DNA samples from convicts seeking exoneration against the national DNA database, in order to determine if the convict has committed other rapes or murders. The other congressional versions of the President's DNA initiative would bar such testing; they effectively would give convicts a free roll of the dice to challenge their current convictions while protecting them against the risk that they will be linked to other crimes. There is no reason why states should be prevented from solving such other crimes. If DNA evidence is good enough to test a prisoner's conviction for the crimes that we do know that he committed, it also is good enough to establish the prisoner's involvement in crimes that we do not yet know that he committed. Fourth, this bill includes all Federal felony arrestees in the federal DNA database. Other versions of this bill exclude arrestees and place other unnecessary and arbitrary limits on the federal DNA index. The federal government already maintains fingerprints for all federal felony arrestees--there is no reason to treat DNA evidence differently. Nor is there any reason to prevent states and the federal government from solving other crimes committed by suspects arrested for a federal felony offense. The Department of Justice has expressly informed Congress of the benefits of casting a wide net when including criminal suspects in the federal DNA database. During a July 17 hearing on the President's DNA initiative before the Crime Subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee, Sarah Hart, the Director of the National Institute of Justice, testified that: Fifth, today's bill tolls the statute of limitations when a perpetrator has been identified through DNA--including in rape cases. Other congressional versions of the President's initiative inexplicably exclude sexual-assault crimes from the initiative's DNA tolling provision. There is no reason to do so. Indeed, it is in sexual-assault cases that DNA evidence is most likely to identify a perpetrator. At the July 17 hearing before the House Judiciary Committee's Crime Subcommittee, the Department of Justice testified in favor of tolling the statute of limitations to the full extent permitted by the Constitution. Sixth, this bill allows grants for DNA training and research to be made to prosecutors' organizations, universities, and other private entities. Competing bill versions limit such grants to state and local governments, which is inconsistent with the President's DNA initiative. Finally, the bill that I introduce today does not include the so- called ``Innocence Protection Act'' , a controversial anti-death penalty bill. The other congressional versions of the President's initiative have incorporated the IPA as a third title to the President's bill. At the July 17 hearing on the President's initiative, the Department of Justice made very clear that it ``do[es] not believe that legislation embodying the important proposals in the President's DNA initiative should be joined to these controversial [IPA] measures, which intrinsically are unrelated to DNA.'' In an October 27 letter to several members of Congress, the National District Attorneys Association also voiced strong objections to the capital-counsel provisions included in the IPA titles of the other bills. The NDAA's letter stated: The IPA titles included in the other congressional versions of the President's DNA initiative would authorize $500 million in Federal funding for State public defenders in State capital cases. There is no reason for Congress to finance the States' public-defender systems. The States adequately fund these programs themselves--indeed, many have enacted reforms and substantially increased funding for public defenders in recent years. When the IPA originally was introduced in 2000, it was targeted at the State of Texas. In 2001, the Texas legislature enacted reforms that completely overhauled the State's public-defender system. Yet the IPA provisions of the other Senate bill would declare Texas's reforms ``ineffective,'' and would force the State to again replace its indigent-defense system. Such a mandate makes no sense. Moreover, there is no reason why States cannot or should not fund their own indigent-defender systems. Basic principles of federalism dictate that each level of government should finance its own operations. Once States become accustomed to and budget for Federal funds, they never are able to reject the money in the future. And Federal funding inevitably comes with increasing Federal strings. In the long run, the States risk losing control over their own public-defender programs. There is no reason to start down this path. The IPA proposals in the other congressional versions of the President's initiative begin by placing a number of conditions on the states' receipt of federal funds. Among these conditions is that states transfer control over capital defense to an ``entity'' composed of persons with ``demonstrated knowledge and expertise in capital representation.''  This new ``entity'' would be charged with: setting standards for capital-defense counsel; deciding which lawyers meet those standards; and appointing lawyers from the roster of qualifying attorneys to represent defendants in particular cases. Essentially, the bill's new ``entity'' would completely control staffing of the defense in capital cases. From past experience with the ``capital resource centers,'' which were defunded by Congress in 1996, we know that hard-core death penalty opponents tend to gravitate toward these jobs, and will engage in litigation abuse when not supervised. Congress should not require the states to repeat its own past mistakes. It should not place anti-death penalty partisans in charge of public representation of capital defendants. The other congressional versions of the President's proposal also include these additional highly problematic provisions: They allow free DNA testing under very low standards. The competing bills provide that DNA tests shall be available to any prisoners if a negative test match would ``raise a reasonable probability that the applicant did not commit the offense.'' This standard is too low. Not all DNA evidence clearly came from the perpetrator of the crime or had anything to do with the crime--for example, a blood spot near the crime scene may or may not have come from the perpetrator. The ``reasonable probability'' standard means a prisoner could secure a test even if, despite a negative match, the other evidence would still show that the prisoner more likely than not committed the crime. The bill requires only a chance that the prisoner did not commit the crime. Almost every prisoner with material to test will be able to meet this standard. Reopening old cases forces victims and their families to relive the ordeal of the crime. They should not be put through this unless a negative test result could at least show more likely than not that the prisoner did not commit the crime. During the July 17 hearing before the House Crime Subcommittee, NIJ Director Sarah Hart expressly warned congress of the consequences of applying unduly low DNA testing standards. Director Hart testified: Post-conviction DNA testing is not without its costs. It should be allowed only in carefully measured circumstances. Another problematic provision in the other congressional versions of the President's DNA initiative would employ an unduly low standard to authorize new trials for very old cases.

I do not know that anybody and any Member opposes that bill. There is also a contact lens bill that deals with the verification program between 1-800 contact lens providers, mail order contact lens providers, and optometrists on verification of the prescription, and that on that particular bill I would say 90 percent of that has been agreed to by the stakeholders. The part that is in dispute is exactly mechanically how to verify the contact lens prescription.

The optometrists, or at least some optometrists, do oppose that.

The language of the Smith amendment states that no funds shall be used either directly through direct allocations from the fund or indirectly from allocations to recovery projects from other Forest Service accounts for the construction of roads in those areas within the recovery project where the construction of roads would be prohibited by any Federal environmental law or applicable land management plan. Now the Boehlert amendment, and I doubt very strongly if there is a Member of the House, if they actually read the Boehlert amendment, would vote for it. And please, before my colleagues cast their vote, actually read the Boehlert amendment because it goes on to change that and say, ``. . . policy that is in effect or has been proposed in the Federal Register by the day of the enactment of this law.'' So any policy, any policy. We are not just talking about roadless areas. We are talking about any policy that is in effect or has been proposed in the Federal Register now becomes law. The gentleman is completely and thoroughly abdicating any responsibility that the legislative branch has. Any authority that the legislative branch has. He is saying any policy that this administration has in effect today or that they have even proposed, that they have even put in the Federal Register, we are giving up on that. That is the effect of putting the Boehlert amendment in. We can have a grand debate about roads. We have heard a lot of pretty funny stuff that has come out here today. I have heard people say that our forests are not in bad condition and that they do not need to be taken care of and that the only way that we can manage them is just to leave them alone and keep people out of it. I think that just shows a complete lack of knowledge as to what is going on in our forests, in our national forests in America today. The truth of what we are saying is we do not care if the Committee on Agriculture has held any hearings on this or not. We do not care if the Committee on Resources has held any hearings on this or not. We do not care whether or not Congress agrees with these policies or not. We do not care about any of that. What we are saying is any policy that is in effect or has been proposed in the Federal Register all of a sudden becomes law. I would guarantee that if we knew all of the policies that are in effect, all of the policies that have been proposed, there is no way we would support that. The gentleman from New York would have us believe that all that this affects is a little roadless area, and that is all we are doing. That is not all we are doing. By the very language that he uses in his amendment, this is as extreme and radical as we can possibly get. We just give up on everything and say whatever the administration has proposed, any policy they have in effect, anything that they want, we are going to put that on this bill. We are just going to go that way. That is the exactly wrong way to go. I know the gentleman from California and I have had a lot of discussions over the years about our forests, the health of our forests, and had some great debates on the floor of this House about what to do on environmental policy and on forest policy. But I am sure that he and his colleagues on the other side of the aisle would agree that it is bad policy for this House to, all of a sudden, say any policy that the administration has in effect, and I know he disagrees with the policies that the administration has in effect, I know many of my colleagues disagree with the policies that this administration has in effect, but any policy that they have in effect today becomes law. It is not just the ones that they are already using, that they are already implementing out in the field; it is anything that they have proposed in the Federal Register all of a sudden goes into effect with the enactment of this law.

This amendment fulfills a simple objective. It helps consumers decide for themselves whether prescription drug prices are fair. As it stands now, consumers know what they pay to a pharmacy for a drug, but they do not know what the manufacturer charges for that drug, what the manufacturer charges other consumers for it, what the manufacturer charges other countries for it, what similar drugs cost. My colleagues get the idea. This amendment would require manufacturers to disclose to American consumers the prices they charge here versus what they charge in other industrialized nations. The pharmaceutical industries question the accuracy of studies comparing prescription drug prices in the U.S. to those in other industrialized countries. They have questioned the accuracy of studies comparing the price seniors pay to those paid by HMOs. Drug makers could put these disputes to rest simply by disclosing their prices. Two weeks ago, I took a dozen seniors from Ohio to a Canadian pharmacy where they paid one-half, one-third, one-sixth of what it would have cost to purchase those same drugs in northeast Ohio. When confronted about price differentials like this, the industry typically tried to deflect the blame by talking about Canada's universal health care system. They imply that the only way to achieve lower prices in this country is to adopt the Canadian health care system. They imply that Canada pays less for prescription drugs because Canadians have a government-run health care program, not because of lower prices. The drug industry conveniently confuses two different issues. Seniors in my district bought prescription drugs in Canada and paid lower prices. They did not step into Canada and suddenly become eligible under that nation's universal health care system. Canada negotiates reasonable drug prices. Its 13 provinces also provide universal health care coverage. That means Canadians receive assistance towards the purchase of prescription drugs. American consumers, in spite of what people here say, in spite of the drug industry, American consumers are smart enough to know the difference. Although the drug industry tends to focus on Canada based on what we can glean from retail pricing studies, Canada is not the only nation that pays lower prices for drugs. The United States pays the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. This amendment says to the drug industry, if those studies are wrong or misleading, just show us your prices. Prescription drug companies may argue that this is proprietary information or raise the issue of price collusion. Of course, they do provide this information to a private organization called IMS, and this company makes the information available to other companies for a price. So drug companies already know each other's prices, so price information is no secret unless one is a consumer. Americans cannot afford to purchase prescription drugs, and they cannot afford not to. Under our amendment, consumers would have the power to compare prices and quality and value to make smart purchases.","word.count":530,"sep11":-1.19943820224719,"years":2000.66011235955,"days":2015,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.331377365815499,"Topic 2":0.42540286325263,"Topic 3":0.00949578598936936,"Topic 4":0.017636570418599,"Topic 5":0.137535917311135,"Topic 6":0.00441433712063737,"Topic 7":0.0384124541113385,"Topic 8":0.00989460377704414,"Topic 9":0.0202947900187822,"Topic 10":0.00553531218496587},{"id":"10419960037375","body":"Curt Weldon: I thank my friend and colleague for yielding. I want to start off by just making one statement at the beginning here because, Mr. Speaker, while we cannot directly speak to those people who may be watching this at home, I can speak to you, Mr. Speaker. I can repeat what is, in fact, the case. As you know, I objected from a parliamentary standpoint to our colleagues who for the past hour or so have been raising questions about the ethics case of Speaker Gingrich. The reason I raise those, as you pointed out, Mr. Speaker, is we are not allowed to discuss an open ethics case in this body until it is concluded. The problem is that they can keep speaking. I have to sit here and every minute raise the objection again, and you would warn them, and that would just go back and forth all night. So we just sit down and let them speak. But I just want, Mr. Speaker, to remind everyone, including our colleagues, that we could have sat here and we could have discussed the ethics case against the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Bonior], which to my understanding is still pending before the Ethics Committee, or perhaps to my understanding there was an ethics case, maybe it has been resolved, against the gentleman from Missouri [Mr. Gephardt]. But we did not choose to do that because we play by the rules and we know that, in fact, as a Member of this institution, any matter currently pending before the Ethics Committee is not to be discussed because the Ethics Committee is totally bipartisan, equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans, and until it is ultimately resolved and brought to a recommendation of this body, we are not supposed to respond. So we could have done the same thing. We could have got up here and laid out all the facts on the Bonior allegations and all the facts about the Gephardt allegations, but we did not choose to do that. We choose to just let them vent their frustrations, if you will, because of their concern of Speaker Gingrich's impact on revolutionizing this country. So if, Mr. Speaker, there are those who think that we were not prepared to respond, that is why, because we, in fact, are abiding by the rules of theHouse. Just to further respond and thank my good friend and colleague who has been a leader in this body, I want to commend him for today passing one of the most historic and most important bills that this institution will pass in this session, and that is how POW Accountability Act, which the gentleman from California [Mr. Dornan] has worked on diligently for how many years?","word.count":457,"sep11":-5.12640449438202,"years":1996.73314606742,"days":617,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.455768687349412,"Topic 2":0.509846886654391,"Topic 3":0.00309742795560297,"Topic 4":0.00670896417608506,"Topic 5":0.00801792071715331,"Topic 6":0.00288104946104707,"Topic 7":0.00353021484109576,"Topic 8":0.00269058949021873,"Topic 9":0.00550979478391383,"Topic 10":0.00194846457107975},{"id":"11020070099118","body":"Kent Conrad: Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak in support of the Food and Energy Security Act of 2007. First, I thank the very able chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Senator Harkin, and the ranking member, Senator Chambliss, for their leadership on this bill. We wouldn't be here today without their leadership. I, for one, deeply appreciate the time and the effort they have poured into this bill. This has been months of determined effort to produce a consensus bill that can command a supermajority in the Senate. It certainly did in the committee. It passed without a dissenting vote. First, Chairman Harkin. I applaud his vision for a new direction for farm policy in America. Make no mistake, this is a very different farm bill because of Chairman Harkin's determination, leadership, and vision. This farm bill goes in a new direction with a much greater commitment to conservation, one that I think over time will prove to have been very wise, because we all know what is happening in the world. We have to do more through the conservation elements of the program in order to be sustainable over time. In addition to that, Chairman Harkin has played a lead role in creating a new option for farmers with the State Revenue Assurance Plan. Of course, he has been a champion for rural development and for reform. Make no mistake, this bill is the beginning of significant reform. If anybody had told us 5 years ago we could get the elimination of the three-entity rule and direct attribution, we would have thought the skies had opened up and there was a whole new day. The fact is it is in this bill. I also applaud Senator Harkin's staff. Mark Halverson, his staff director, who you can see is now somewhat gray-haired. Anybody who has gone through what he has goes to gray, because this is tough. This is hard to do. The regional differences are deep across the country, as are the philosophical differences. Senator Chambliss, the ranking member. We couldn't ask for a better ranking member than Senator Chambliss. He did a terrific job as chairman, but he proved his mettle in helping us bring this farm bill to the floor. He is a consummate professional. I have worked with a lot of people over the years on farm legislation. It is always difficult; It is always contentious. Yet we have produced some very good bills. I think this one is by far the best. Senator Chambliss played an absolutely essential role. Make no mistake, he fought for his people. He did it effectively and in a collegial way, and that is what we would hope for in the Senate. He always had his eye on the ball, and that was to produce a result for American agriculture. I also salute his staff, the very professional Martha Scott and Bernie Hubert, who were terrific to work with every step of the way; outstanding individuals who reflect well on Senator Chambliss and reflect well on the body. Additionally, I thank the outstanding work of the chairman of the Finance Committee, Chairman Baucus, and the ranking member, Senator Grassley, because without their help, it would have been infinitely more difficult to write this bill. Let's say right at the beginning that we have $8 billion of new resources here; in other words, we are $8 billion above the so-called baseline. The only reason we could do that was because of the help of the Finance Committee. That has made a profound difference. As a result, and as a result of the exceptional leadership of Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Chambliss, this bill significantly improves commodity programs and energy. We are now embarked on a massive effort to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. It is in this bill. It is critically important. There are also new resources for nutrition. Changes that have not been made in nutrition in over 30 years have been made in this bill, and people can be proud of it; over $5 billion of new resources for nutrition. We should recall, to all those who are listening, this isn't just a food and energy security bill; this is also at root a nutrition bill. Sixty- six percent of the money in this bill is for nutrition in America. That affects every city and town, every farm gate, every ranch gate in America. Sixty-six percent of the money in this bill is for nutrition. For all of those critics--and there are legions of them out there-- especially in some parts of the media who have never bothered to actually look at this bill or read this bill or research what is in it, they should know that 66 percent of this bill is for nutrition. The thing that draws most of their attack, the so-called commodity programs, less than 14 percent; less than $1 in every $7 in this bill is for commodities. Conservation. Because of Senator Harkin's vision and leadership, this is by far the most ambitious conservation program ever included in farm legislation, and he is right. He is right to take us in that direction. The people who are the critics should know that conservation and nutrition are at the centerpiece of this legislation, and rural development programs as well. This legislation is good for farm and ranch families. It is good for rural communities and Main Street businesses. It is an enormous win for consumers and taxpayers. This legislation is the product of countless hours of deliberation that represents a broad consensus. Let me also say the occupant of the chair, Senator Salazar of Colorado, played a key role time after time after time in bringing people together. At the end of the day, what you learn in a legislative body is you have to have an idea, a kernel of an idea for legislation, and it then has to be sold to so many people, and that is the difficult part. Bringing people together is an extraordinary skill. The occupant of the chair, Senator Salazar, has it in spades. I have told others we are lucky to have somebody of his character and somebody of his ability to talk to others, even when they disagree, to find areas of agreement. That has been his great gift on this bill. There are so many others whom I want to single out. Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, who is such a passionate advocate for specialty crops. My goodness, Chairman Harkin, if we heard once, we heard 100 times from her about specialty crops, and boy, she has delivered for those people in this bill, over $2.5 billion of new resources for specialty crops. When you include everything, what a major advance for specialty crops, and there is nothing better than this fresh fruit and vegetable program. Of course, the chairman is the champion of that program, but we are going to go from 14 States that have this fresh fruit and vegetable program for kids in schools, and it is going to go to all 50 States, and a dramatic increase in resources. Because we know--we can see--what is happening in America. We can see what is happening with obesity. We can see there has to be change, and there is dramatic change in this bill--change that I think every Member of this body can be proud of. I mentioned Senator Baucus and the role he played as chairman of the Finance Committee. I can look down that table at others who have contributed. This was a team effort, if ever there was a team effort, on both the Republican and Democratic sides. We appreciate the efforts of so many of our colleagues. I think of our friend from Arkansas, who was so passionate about defending her people, Blanche Lambert Lincoln. It is tough when you are in a minority situation. But she was absolutely determined that her people not be hurt. She worked tirelessly to make certain that was the outcome. So I appreciate the efforts of so many. Ben Nelson of Nebraska, who comes from a farm State much like mine, was so determined, as well, that we write a farm bill that could get through the committee on a strong bipartisan vote and get through the floor on a supermajority, which we have done. I thank Amy Klobuchar, who was so determined to make certain we would look at cellulosic, recognizing that corn ethanol could not meet the ambitious national goals set by the Congress of the United States, and that we had to turn toward cellulosic. She was right there with ideas, advice, and also a willingness to go colleague to colleague to persuade them of the need. All of these people have made enormous contributions. Of course, Senator Leahy's contribution on MILC programs, the former chairman of the committee. We deeply appreciate his contribution as well. It is difficult to write this bill because, as the chairman said, we have a lot less money this time than last time. Let me put that in terms people will more easily understand, in visual terms. The red line on the chart is the old CBO baseline, what the farm bill would cost. The green bars are what this bill has actually cost and is projected to cost. If you net it all out, you find that the 2002 farm bill cost about $20 billion less than the Congressional Budget Office said it would in August of 2002. Looking forward, we have $22 billion less in baseline to write this farm bill than was estimated by the CBO in 2002. I took a call from Mr. Chuck Connor, Acting Secretary, telling me they are going to recommend--or say tomorrow that they would recommend a Presidential veto of this legislation. They do it on cost grounds. They have a number they throw out there that has no relationship to reality. It is an imagining on their part. It is their sort of make-believe writing up of the numbers. The fact is we have $22 billion less in baseline to write this bill than was predicted when we wrote the last one--$22 billion less. So we are $8 billion over the baseline and every penny of it paid for. That is a fact. It is also true that this bill was difficult to write not only because we had less money but because the financial circumstances of the country changed dramatically. The debt of the country increased from $5.8 trillion at the end of 2001 to $8.9 trillion at the end of this year. So we were writing this bill in a totally different environmen","word.count":5755,"sep11":6.30898876404494,"years":2008.16853932584,"days":4688,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0478176137954034,"Topic 2":0.0871476928949272,"Topic 3":0.0233369484802492,"Topic 4":0.185574348216896,"Topic 5":0.183063900744186,"Topic 6":0.00253354043191524,"Topic 7":0.00253673032482416,"Topic 8":0.374547402478834,"Topic 9":0.0123567723535685,"Topic 10":0.0810850502791964},{"id":"10519970018685","body":"John Ensign: Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Tax Code Termination Act. Really, when you think about it, this is a rather momentous day, the fact that the United States Congress would come together and have a vote on this matter. Whether we are against this or for it, this is a very significant period in our history to be able to come on the House floor and say we are against the present Tax Code and we wish to change it. It is important to relate to the constituents and to Members that there is an exception in this for Social Security and Medicare. So when we are eliminating the Tax Code, we are not attacking Social Security. We are not attacking Medicare. Be that as it may, the last tax decreases in this country provided 300 changes to the Tax Code. If all of us on the Republican side and on the Democrat side go out and say, oh, we have decreased taxes, but at the same time, changed the Tax Code 300 times, what have we done? If we do that year after year after year, it is going to get impossible. In fact, that is where we are today. It is literally impossible to do our taxes. We are starting the debate by saying, okay, let us do away with the Tax Code by 2002 and replace it with a sales tax or a flat tax or a combination thereof. What is wrong with that? If anybody is going to vote against this, they are voting against open discussion to have a new system. So how can anybody be against the idea of reforming. In America, there are seven traits that make up all of us because we are an American; and one of them is we like choice, and the other is we like reform. We are willing to change things. We are not satisfied with the status quo. We are always trying to improve. A third thing is we are impatient as Americans. We believe there is a better way. So what we are doing this afternoon is we are saying there is a better way for America to pay their taxes. Secondly, we think we can reform the system we have, and let us make the decision, the choice if you will, now to eliminate the Tax Code and get the discussion going.","word.count":387,"sep11":-4.32022471910112,"years":1997.5393258427,"days":904,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.115414276938131,"Topic 2":0.335352006027803,"Topic 3":0.301797558434226,"Topic 4":0.0219635363110866,"Topic 5":0.0978962255360973,"Topic 6":0.0232360759430616,"Topic 7":0.00293518278604841,"Topic 8":0.0779862675886426,"Topic 9":0.0038749507883953,"Topic 10":0.0195439196465087},{"id":"10720020004313","body":"Ron Kind: Mr. Speaker, this legislation offered today is meant to better preserve and protect one of the great national treasures that exist in this country, the Mississippi River Basin. I would like to thank, first of all, Chairman Hansen of our committee and Chairman Calvert of the subcommittee and their staffs for the assistance and the cooperation we received in putting this legislation together. I also want to thank Ranking Member Rahall and also Ranking Member Smith of the subcommittee and their staff for all the help and assistance that we have received. This is simple legislation, Mr. Speaker. The intent of it is to authorize the U.S. Geological Survey to be able to put together the science and implement the science so we can better track and monitor the nutrients and sediments that flow into the Upper Mississippi River Basin. It would develop for the first time a public-private approach and coordination in order to develop a comprehensive monitoring and a state-of-the-art computer modeling program in order to track the sediment and nutrient flows into the river basin. This legislation has been near and dear to my heart, Mr. Speaker. As a young boy growing up in western Wisconsin, I spent an inordinate amount of my time growing up on the Mississippi River. I guess you could refer to me as the ``Tom Sawyer'' of the United States Congress, but since we already have a Tom Sawyer from Ohio I guess I will just accept the label of Huck Finn. Huck was probably more colorful, anyway. But as a young kid growing up, I spent a lot of my time on the Mississippi enjoying the recreational activities, the swimming, the fishing, the hunting, but I still remember those days during the sixties and during the seventies when I would go down to my favorite swimming beaches and find that they were closed because of high bacteria count, or going down to my favorite fishing holes and finding notices that were posted around these popular fishing areas warning the fishermen not to eat the fish that they were catching because of the contamination and the effect on the quality of the fish supplies. I knew even then as a young boy that something was not quite right. Since those days, a lot of progress has been made in regards to the health, viability and sustainability of the river basin. There is still much work that needs to be done. If you talk to the experts in the river system both in the north and the southern part, the one thing that has really been lacking or missing is a comprehensive scientific program so we can collect the baseline data at sub-basin level in order to understand more the effects of the sediment and nutrient flows going into this valuable ecosystem. Why is this important? It is important on a number of fronts, not least of which is economic. This is a multiple-use river system, from commercial navigation to tourist activity to recreation activity. It has been in the past with the lock and dam system; it is today and it will continue to be so in the future. But there also is the need for balance and balanced use in regards to the river basin. There is a $1.2 billion recreation impact in the Upper Mississippi States alone and a $6.6 billion tourism impact. In fact, we have more visitors every year to the Upper Mississippi Wildlife Refuge than they do in the Yellowstone National Park System. It is also the primary drinking supply source for over 22 million Americans. It is North America's largest migratory route, with over 40 percent of the waterfowl species using the river basin as its main corridor during its migratory pattern every year. It also provides us, as this picture demonstrates, the fertile farmland which makes the Midwest the breadbasket of the United States and the rest of the world. But there are also some challenges with the system. Because of the sediment flows flowing into the river, it is costing us roughly $100 million every year just to maintain a 9-foot navigable channel with the dredging costs in order to keep the commercial navigation flowing along the river system. Our farmers are losing valuable topsoil. In fact, they are losing $300 million worth of applied nitrogen every year that ultimately flows into the rivers and streams and affects the ecosystem adversely. This litigation has received wide bipartisan support, from the original cosponsors when I introduced the legislation to a variety of experts in the Upper Mississippi States. It is consistent with the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico Hypoxia Task Force that was formed over the last few years, studying the nutrient problems that are affecting especially the Gulf of Mexico and the dead zone that is being created there. The Upper Mississippi, although it supplies 22 percent of the water that ultimately flows into the Gulf of Mexico, nevertheless it is the source of 32 percent of the nutrients that are flowing into the Gulf of Mexico, and it is consistent with the recommendations that they are making for a public and private coordinated approach with Federal, State, local agencies, private entities and tribes to do a better job of collaborating and to standardize the data that is now being collected. At one point during the research of this legislation, I discovered there were 77 different private entities that were doing some form of water quality testing, but there was very little sharing of information because the data was not standardized. This legislation will address that problem. But it also addresses a very important privacy protection concern that some groups that we worked with raised, and I feel the language that we have in here with regard to the protection of sharing personal data of private landowners meets the test that a lot of these groups were raising. It is also consistent with what a number of States have talked about that is needed in regards to the River Basin and its protection. In fact, a number of States have also weighed in on the need to increase monitoring and modeling efforts throughout the Upper Mississippi River Basin. In October of 2001, in a letter to a Bush administration official, six Governors of the States bordering the Mississippi wrote that, ``A monitoring effort conducted jointly by the U.S. Geological Survey and the States is required within the Basin to determine the water quality effects of the actions taken and to measure the success of efforts on a sub-basin and project level.'' H.R. 3480 does exactly what the Governors of those States were recommending, bringing in a variety of groups in order to have a more comprehensive monitoring and computer modeling system so that the science will be able to demonstrate where the hot spots exist, where the problem areas are, so we are in a better position then of making policy choices of how better to direct the limited resources to get the optimal effect of the investment in land stewardship through , voluntary and incentive-based land conservation programs, and the benefit that is going to bring to the entire river basin area. My district, Mr. Speaker, has more miles that border the Mississippi River than any other congressional district in the Nation, and therefore I felt a certain personal responsibility to keep an eye on the river and to promote good policy and legislation that will enhance the long-term sustainability of this great natural resource. It is one of the reasons I was motivated to help form a bipartisan Mississippi River Task Force so that we can start working more effectively together between the upper Mississippi region and the southern Mississippi River region on issues of common ground and to better educate ourselves in regard to the different uses of this valuable river system. Finally, Mr. Speaker, I do want to thank a few individuals who have been very helpful in support of this legislation. I want to, of course, thank the original cosponsors of this legislation, including the other cochairs of the Upper Mississippi River Task Force, the gentleman from Minnesota , the gentleman from Iowa , and the gentleman from Illinois . I also want to thank the congressional cochairs of the entire Mississippi River Caucus, the gentleman from Missouri and the gentleman from Iowa for their support and their staff's support for this legislation. In addition, I want to thank Ms. Holly Stoerker of the Upper Mississippi River Basin Association, Mr. Doug Daigle of the Mississippi River Basin Alliance, Dr. Jerry Schnoor of the University of Iowa, and Dr. Barry Drazkowski and the administration and staff at St. Mary's University in Minnesota for a lot of the ideas that are contained within this legislation. Their expertise and testimony during the hearings that we have had on this legislation was essential in crafting the bipartisan approach that this legislation takes. Also greatly appreciated is the tireless work of a few individuals in my office, former Sea Grant fellow Allen Hance, who is now with the Northeast Midwest Institute, along with other Sea Grant fellows, Laura Cimo, Jeff Stein and Ed Buckner, who have worked in my office, worked specifically on this legislation dealing with a lot of the shareholders and groups interested in this legislation, as well as other issues affecting the Mississippi River Basin area. I also want to thank a couple permanent members on my staff, Ben Proctor, who is with us on the floor today, and also Brad Pfaff, who has carried a lot of the weight with this legislation during the period of time we have been working on it. Their help has been greatly appreciated. H.R. 3480 represents a commonsense move toward building the scientific foundation necessary to remedy nutrient and sediment problems throughout the Mississippi River Basin. I believe this is a needed, cost-effective step in preserving the Upper Mississippi River and its multiple-use heritage for future generations, and I would urge my colleagues to support this legislation.","word.count":1675,"sep11":0.589887640449438,"years":2002.44943820225,"days":2652,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.00609217237078198,"Topic 2":0.159189369856631,"Topic 3":0.00640094922353397,"Topic 4":0.00212568442586495,"Topic 5":0.714402837959159,"Topic 6":0.00164385579377454,"Topic 7":0.00151022310616906,"Topic 8":0.0524361686189255,"Topic 9":0.0249262138517744,"Topic 10":0.0312725247933853},{"id":"10419950091503","body":"Arlen Specter: Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes When the argument is made by the Senator from Arkansas that there is an assault on public broadcasting, I would remind him that the major assault is on the deficit, and as chairman of the subcommittee we looked at $5.9 billion of rescissions by the House, and we reduced that to $3.05 billion, and asked public broadcasting to take a fair share, leaving them with the same amount they had last year.

Their priorities are expressed in Senator Domenici's budget proposal which is now pending on the Senate floor. The loss leaders in this Republican budget are the basic health programs protecting our Nation's senior citizens, poor children, the disabled, and pregnant women, also known as Medicare and Medicaid. Historic levels of cuts in these programs--$256 billion out of Medicare and $175 billion out of Medicaid--make the major contribution to the deficit reduction in their proposal. Education gets hit hard, as do other investment priorities I care about, like job training. Our Nation's veterans lose. Working families who depend on the earned income tax credit lose. In my judgment, the people of West Virginia, whom I represent, lose under the Republican budget proposal. Nevertheless, the Republican budget priorities are here. Their budget is finally on the table and the subject of discussion and debate in the U.S. Senate. Is that what Republicans want to debate and talk about? No. The Republicans' first order of business during the floor action of their budget has been to exercise their parliamentary right to offer the first amendment. Their first amendment, offered by the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, is to substitute the President's fiscal year 1996 budget for their long-awaited proposal. It seems rather odd to propose a complete substitute for their much anticipated proposal before there has been any real debate on the Senate floor about what is in their proposal--who wins and who loses under their plan. And it is even more extraordinary that my Republican colleagues would choose to move to adopt the President's budget proposal as a substitute, after purporting to have just outlined their version of a responsible budget before the Senate. Why have they asked the Senate to vote on the President's budget before any meaningful [[Page S6960]] discussion has ensued about the details of the Republican budget proposal? Why have they changed the subject? This amendment is nothing more than a political ploy. I suppose it is meant to make the point that the President's budget would not garner a majority of votes in the Senate. But we already know that. They are not going to vote for it and they are the majority of Members of this body. Undoubtedly, their proposed amendment will fail, regardless of how Democratic Senators vote. So they must be using their parliamentary right purely to make a political point. A point which seems obvious to me. I believe they have chosen to pursue this strategy because they want to distract the American people, the Senate, the media, from what ought to be the focus of our budget debate--the affects of the Republican budget proposal on the budgets of America's working families, seniors, small businesses, students, and on the investments I believe are important to the job creation and job growth. They do not want to talk about the details of their plan. They want to talk about somebody else's plan. They want to score political points. Well, much as they seem to dislike the fact that they are now being asked to produce the details of their budget and explain what their priorities are, it is their responsibility to do so. They are the new majority. We made tough choices when we were in the majority. We produced consistent deficit reduction. Under Democratic congressional leadership we reduced the deficit by over a trillion dollars in the last 5 years. We have met the challenge. It is their turn to lead. Their first response is to say let us talk about something else. Well that is just not good enough. They have a duty to explain what is in their proposal and why. They have yet to do that in any meaningful way, despite a slew of opening statements given on the floor today. For instance, we have heard people suggest the Medicare Program's growth is out of control and that is why it ought to be restricted. That is not the real reason the Republican budget slashes in Medicare. The real reason, I believe, is that they need huge amounts of Medicare cuts to pull off balancing the budget on their arbitrary timetable. The truth is Medicare's growing at the same rate as the health care costs of other Americans, including our health care costs of those of us here in Congress, maybe a percent higher. That is hardly way out of sync with the increases that individual Americans are coping with, and it is to be expected when we have yet to address the country's basic need for fundamental health care reform. So why the need to zero in on Medicare for mammoth cuts--to pay for an irresponsible and unfair tax cut for the rich. I would be derelict not to note that our failure to deal with the complicated issues of health care reform last year means that our deficit problem is even greater. Indeed, the major complaint about the President's fiscal year 1996 budget--that it does not produce sufficient deficit reduction--would be moot if we had achieved comprehensive health care reform last year. As Democrats have been warning for years, and as President Clinton insisted throughout his campaign, if we don't deal with our Nation's health care problems which affect our","word.count":895,"sep11":-6.48033707865169,"years":1995.37921348315,"days":135,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0250598424397333,"Topic 2":0.0164094071754353,"Topic 3":0.00627876027787159,"Topic 4":0.00371004378434086,"Topic 5":0.0363251740892483,"Topic 6":0.0319563712469103,"Topic 7":0.86192363729165,"Topic 8":0.0108397212512177,"Topic 9":0.00632006499640087,"Topic 10":0.00117697744719211},{"id":"10920060013921","body":"Mike Thompson: Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Illinois and my colleague from California, and I concur that this is an important resolution. Although the beer measure was taken up first; as someone who has lived in the wine industry my entire life, someone who grows wine grapes and someone who has worked in many different jobs in the wine industry, I can tell you firsthand that there is truth in the old saying that it takes a lot of beer to make good wine. So it is probably appropriate that both of these measures are taken up tonight. Mr. Speaker, I have the distinct honor and pleasure of representing California's 1st Congressional District, home to over 500 wineries, I believe and I think everyone would agree, the heart and soul of the American wine industry. So you might ask why it is that I would have introduced a resolution honoring a French wine tasting. As my colleague from California said, the fact of the matter is the Paris Wine Tasting of 1976 is the seminal event in the history of the U.S. wine industry. At that event, some of Europe's greatest wine critics, those from within the European wine community, chose U.S. wines as the winners of that tasting in a blind test. That is why that wine tasting is known even today as the tasting heard around the world. The Paris tasting was proof that American wine makers could compete with the best in the world, that wine makers like Warren Winiarski of Stag's Leap Wine Cellars and Mike Grgich of Chateau Montelena, he now owns his own winery, but at the time he was the wine maker at Chateau Montelena, were in fact making some of the best wines in the world. Robert Parker, the world-renowned wine critic, put it best when he said, ``The Paris tasting destroyed the myth of French supremacy and marked the democratization of the wine world. It was a watershed in the history of wine.'' The tasting served as a launching pad for an industry that has grown to become a major contributor to our national economy, now totaling over $50 billion a year. There are over 4,000 commercial wineries throughout all 50 States. Many of them are small family-owned businesses. The number has grown by 30 percent in the last 4 years, and the wine industry and the tourism that it generates employs over 250,000 tax-paying Americans. It is, in fact, a great industry, and our wines are in fact the best. It is appropriate that we take this time to commend those who participated in and the industry that has grown out of the Paris Wine Tasting of 1976. I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this. I thank you for the courtesy of bringing this measure up tonight, both out of order and on the floor, recognizing the 30th anniversary of this famous wine tasting.","word.count":489,"sep11":4.85674157303371,"years":2006.71629213483,"days":4171,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.156257001529716,"Topic 2":0.0457814005091949,"Topic 3":0.199324646387615,"Topic 4":0.00732698563213024,"Topic 5":0.52393223917353,"Topic 6":0.0044863557583787,"Topic 7":0.00231874260887135,"Topic 8":0.0393334334003934,"Topic 9":0.00752669220896887,"Topic 10":0.0137125027912017},{"id":"10720020048588","body":"Mary Landrieu: Madam President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senator Cantwell of Washington, Senator Smith of New Hampshire, and Senator Grassley of Iowa, as a co-sponsor of this critical amendment to provide justice, dignity, and equal rights to our service women stationed in Saudi Arabia. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia requires its women to wear garment called the abaya, it is a covering which extends from head to toe on a woman. It is part of the Muslim faith and their customs and traditions. The Saudi Arabian government does not require American women living or visiting in Saudi Arabia to wear the abaya. Rather, both men and women are encouraged to wear modest American clothing. When visitors come to my home, I anticipate they will abide by the rules I have established in my home. Therefore, I respect the wishes of the Saudi government, that when westerns enter Saudi Arabia, westerns should wear modest clothing. I would not want to violate the customs of a host country. What I cannot understand is why the Department of Defense has determined that American service-women must wear the abaya when they leave the confines of the military bases in Saudi Arabia. The host government does not mandate that service women wear the abaya. More importantly to me, the Saudi government does not require our service women to dress differently from our service men. However, our very own Department of Defense requires our service-women to dress differently from our service men. This is unjust and outrageous. Our service women are equals to their male counterparts in the Armed Services. Women have died and bled in defense of this country. They can fly fighters, pilot helicopters, and drive ships. Those rights did not come easily. Roadblocks were put in the way, and I thought they has been overcome. But now, the Department of Defense wants to make our first-rate women soldiers second class citizens in the United States military. I hope the Senate will approve this amendment and stand with the House of Representatives, which passed similar legislation, to send a strong message to the Department of Defense that women in uniform are not second class citizens. In closing, I want to salute the women who brought this issue to America's attention. Lieutenant Colonel Martha McSally has always been a warrior. She fought the Pentagon's bureaucracy to become one of the first female fighter pilots. And, now she has to fight the Pentagon, once gain, in a court of law to overturn the Pentagon's abaya policy. Colonel McSally you serve as an inspiration to young women across the United States who want to serve their country. Today, I hope the Senate can come to Colonel McSally's defense, and all women serving in Saudi Arabia, to lift this irrational Pentagon rule.","word.count":465,"sep11":0.803370786516854,"years":2002.66292134831,"days":2728,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.294412914964202,"Topic 2":0.111079989240331,"Topic 3":0.00686323631121218,"Topic 4":0.0843291860873927,"Topic 5":0.475693836069589,"Topic 6":0.00532338702425911,"Topic 7":0.0023759640608235,"Topic 8":0.0144535602772471,"Topic 9":0.00218367788306278,"Topic 10":0.00328424808188089},{"id":"10720020043075","body":"John Warner: I say, then, Mr. President, the purpose for my initiating this debate has been accomplished.

I think it is worth our time to spend a few minutes this morning looking into the question that motivated this legislation. It is important because the question here is whether or not Federal agencies should respect and abide by case law precedent established by the Federal Courts of Appeal. The answer to that question, in my opinion, should be self-evident. But apparently it is not; and, of course, the self-evident answer is these Federal agencies should be bound by court precedents; and I think that is probably the opinion shared by most of the people that we represent in this country. Chief Justice John Marshall stated in the case of Marbury versus Madison, and that case has become one of the cornerstones of our democracy, that it is emphatically the providence and the duty of the judicial department to say what the law is. The courts having said what the law is, it is the duty of every citizen, and that just as emphatically includes the executive branch, to follow the law. It would seem strange that the question has arisen as to whether or not our Federal agencies, who by the way work for our people, who are bound by the courts, that there is some question as to whether they are bound to follow the law as determined by the courts. But for many years now agencies have asserted it is their right to determine whether or not they should acquiesce in court decisions. It is a right that has been granted or conceded to agencies by neither the courts nor Congress, and the result is an unwarranted exercise that has been the infliction of needless hardship on many of our most disadvantaged citizens, not to mention the destructive effect on the American legal system and the confidence that the ordinary people have in their government. The ordinary people in this country face the consequences of a court action. They cannot defy a court action. Why on goodness earth should the Federal agencies be able to ignore Federal court decisions? The Judicial Conference of the United States, which is chaired by the Chief Justice, has identified agency nonacquiescence as a policy that undermines certainty and fair application of the law. It has recommended in strong terms that the Congress enact a law to control it. Thus, the bill that we consider today, supported by the Judicial Conference, not to mention other groups, such as the American Bar Association, attempts to put some order back into the situation by prohibiting agencies from engaging in a general policy of nonacquiescence. We have attempted to provide agencies the latitude necessary in the administration of their various programs, but we have considered just as importantly the legitimate expectation of persons who appear before and whose lives are affected by Federal agencies. Disadvantaged supplicants face insurmountable hardships when a Federal agency reserves that right to follow its own policy despite the fact that an appellate court has decided a question of law against it. The aged, the disabled, the impoverished not to mention most ordinary citizens who are affected by an agency's policy of nonacquiescence lack the resources to carry out a fight against an agency through the courts to receive what the Court of Appeals has already said is their right. In fact, few, if any, citizens, no matter what their status is in our society, have the time or the resources to battle the agency juggernaut. That is why it is so important to ensure that agencies follow applicable precedent absent a good reason to the contrary. I think that this bill, with bipartisan cosponsorship that includes the distinguished ranking member, represents a fair and workable measure that will ensure that those who administer our laws also realize that they have a duty to follow them. The bill recognizes circumstances may sometimes warrant limited nonacquiescence by an agency and those situations are provided and addressed in this bill. H.R. 1544 takes a stronger position against intracircuit nonacquiescence than it does against intercircuit nonacquiescence because it recognizes that an agency's decision not to obey a Circuit Court of Appeals precedent within that circuit is an extraordinary attack on the principle of stare decisis, which must be controlled by the courts. Needless and repetitive litigation, seeking to create intercircuit conflicts with respect to the administration of a program or rule can also have destructive effects. But these are such that I think we can rely upon the Attorney General to prevent by placing upon her the duty to report annually to us on government compliance. I know in the last few minutes I have been using a lot of legal terms, but to put it very simply in the language that a lot of us understand, that is that if the average ordinary person out there is ordered by a Federal court to do something, they have to follow that. They have to acquiesce to the Federal court's orders. We have a history of Federal agencies deciding they do not have to agree, or acquiesce, that is the word that has been used in the testimony we have had, they make a decision of nonacquiescence, that they do not have to follow the same kind of court orders that the ordinary citizen that we represent has to. That is what this bill is trying to correct. That is what this bill, with assistance from other people like the American Bar Association and so on, is trying to curb, to force Federal agencies to live within the same bounds that the ordinary person has to. Some might argue that agencies which have in the past been so nonacquiescent, nonagreeable, should be trusted to change their spots. I do not think so. I do not think we can depend upon them to do it. I think that time after time though we have complained about it and no action has been taken. It is now time for us in the United States Congress to take action and pass this bill. I have of interest here a letter from the American Bar Association. That is pretty controlling authority. That is the body of attorneys throughout the United States. They form an association that carries a lot of weight. They have experts in this area. I would like to read that letter. It is dated February 24, 1998. It is from the American Bar Association. It is addressed to the gentleman from Pennsylvania , the chairman. I will not go ahead and read the rest of this letter. I know that we would like to move on. We do have an open rule here. I would ask for Members' support on that open rule. But it is important that we remember the concept, and that is that the law that the ordinary person has to follow, as issued by the Federal courts, should very well be expected to be followed by the Federal agencies when the Federal court renders a decision involving those agencies.","word.count":1179,"sep11":-3.63483146067416,"years":1998.22471910112,"days":1148,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.446797284021589,"Topic 2":0.25771903234741,"Topic 3":0.0318362675527509,"Topic 4":0.0627753702996612,"Topic 5":0.037268914221522,"Topic 6":0.0272730737182496,"Topic 7":0.0291532429088814,"Topic 8":0.0478427231580795,"Topic 9":0.0427402869597946,"Topic 10":0.0165938048120622},{"id":"11020070050170","body":"Heath Shuler: Without objection, it is so ordered","word.count":256,"sep11":6.27247191011236,"years":2008.13202247191,"days":4675,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0678726145986611,"Topic 2":0.0169526367468518,"Topic 3":0.0150068708841209,"Topic 4":0.00761012668509803,"Topic 5":0.151168107006054,"Topic 6":0.0158619481777494,"Topic 7":0.00377363882216761,"Topic 8":0.643370540766244,"Topic 9":0.0152670571155027,"Topic 10":0.0631164591975505},{"id":"10820040010324","body":"Elijah Cummings: Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his leadership and service. I want to very briefly discuss some points. This afternoon there was a vote on a resolution to condemn those folks, military and otherwise, who did these despicable acts to prisoners in Iraq. As soon as I got back to my office, Mr. Speaker, I was asked by several papers and news outlets why is it that you voted against the resolution, joining some 50 other Members in doing so. I guess the thing that I would have to say is timing. Here we are, we had a resolution which basically said, and let me quote it, it says, ``Resolved, That the House of Representatives deplores and condemns abuse of persons in the United States custody in Iraq regardless of the circumstances.'' And then it goes on to talk about a handful. It says ``declares the alleged crimes of a handful of individuals should not detract from the commendable sacrifices of over 300,000 members of the United States Armed Forces who have served,'' and it goes on. I think in and of itself the word ``handful'' is very, very upsetting to me. We do not have a clue at this juncture as to how extensive this abuse is. We have a situation where we know that there are officers, military officers, who are in the various pictures. We know about the report that was written by the military, a very extensive report that Secretary Rumsfeld just recently said he had not read; but the fact is that this is a situation that certainly calls for us not early on limiting this to a ``handful'' of military personnel, or a ``handful'' of individuals, but it is one where we should be simply asking the question what happened here in Iraq at the Abu Ghraib prison. Do we have similar circumstances in Afghanistan? Do we have similar circumstances at Guantanamo Bay? I think when all is said and done, the resolution that we passed today that I voted against will be inaccurate in declaring that there were only a handful of individuals. One of the other concerns that I had about this document was that it talked about the military investigating this matter as if the Congress consisted of a bunch of potted plants sitting in a window doing nothing. This is a Congress that voted with regard to the Iraq War. This is a Congress that has stood up over and over again talking about its love for our military. This is a great Congress. But the fact is that when we stand to the side and say to our military to go and investigate themselves and then send us a report from time to time, I think it sends a horrible message not only to the military, and I will explain that in a moment, but it also sends a horrible message to the Muslim community and to the world. Why do I say that? It would appear that there has already been substantial finger pointing within the military itself. The people who are caught in the picture, some of them have said that they have got orders from higher-ups. The person who was in charge of all the prisoners there said that she did not even have much of any authority on this particular cell block. So then there is finger pointing in the military in and of itself. There are also allegations that civilians were involved in all of this. So the question becomes not whether the military can effectively do a good job of investigating itself, the question becomes is how will the investigation appear to the world when we have already gotten finger pointing within the military itself? Just the other night, I was at the Howard County Muslim Council at a dinner in my district. And as I listened and I talked to members of the Muslim community, some of them with tears in their eyes talked about how offensive these pictures were and how offensive the allegations were to the Muslim people, not only because of who they are, not only because of their culture, but also because of their religion. And one of the things that they talked about was whether they could now trust the United States to do a fair job in providing a transparent and thorough investigation of these types of acts. And one of the things that they asked me to do is just ask the question why not a tribunal? Why not a worldwide investigative agency look into this so that when the message is sent back to the world, the world will be satisfied that we have done all that we could to investigate every single human being, be they military or civilian, that had anything to do with these kinds of despicable acts no matter where they may fall in the line of command? So what they want is an investigation which is thorough and one that is transparent and one where they can feel comfortable that all of those involved will be brought to justice and that they will be punished accordingly. So that is so very important that we do that. The other thing that concerned me here was that we talk about investigating a handful of people and we talk about wanting to make sure that these investigations take place, but as I said a little bit earlier, what is the Congress's role in all of this? We have a duty. We have a duty to look into these matters. We have a duty as a Senate and the House to look carefully at every aspect of all of this because one of the things that we do that no other organization on this level does in this country is we set policy not only for this country, but quite often policy that affects the world. And if we are not gathering information ourselves to make sure that we have a complete understanding of how these kinds of acts could take place and whether there were people asleep at the switch or whether there were folks who simply did not care or whether there were people who just failed to read reports, and then to claim that they had no knowledge of the information, or whether those who had an obligation to let the Congress know and the President know of these atrocities and did not, we need to have that information so that we can set policy to make sure that it never happens again and so that we can send a powerful message, a very powerful message, to the world that we have done all that we could do. The other audience that we send a message to is our military. Early on in this process, we would read reports where the President and others and military brass said we will reprimand certain folks that may have been in the chain of command. And as soon as I heard that, I said it is too early. It is too early to be reprimanding anybody because I do not see how they can reprimand when they do not know the full extent of the alleged offense. It does not make sense. So when our friends in the Muslim community and when our friends in the world hear that, the question is, is this a slap on the wrist to reprimand someone for being a part of a process that caused other people to go through indignities and to be offended to such a great extent? I just think that that sends a wrong message to the military when they hear that there is going to be a slap on the wrist early on before a true investigation by the military or by the Congress or by an international tribunal-type organization is done. It sends a terrible message. And the message that it sends is that, although millions of people have been offended by these acts, that they do not measure up to the kind of investigation and the type of justice that they should be subjected to. And that is a major problem because we do not want anyone believing, whether they are in the military or whether they are civilian, that this kind of conduct is all right. Finally, the other audience is the American people and our soldiers. The American people have stood up over and over again, as has the Congressional Black Caucus, for our troops. They believe in our troops, for they are our sons, our daughters, our mothers, our fathers, our aunts, our friends. They are the ones who live in our neighborhoods. They are the ones who coach the Little League baseball team. They are the police officers when they, as National Guard, would go away on weekends and now they are serving for more than a year, but they are our neighbors; so we all care about them. We also are in prayer for them for we realize that they are in harm's way. It pains us tremendously when we go to Walter Reed Hospital and see our young men and young women with amputations of the leg and of the arms. It pains us tremendously when we see pictures on the front page of The Washington Post and The New York Times of caskets, rows and rows of caskets, of our young people coming back in these steel caskets. It hurts and it pains us. But the fact still remains that, as the gentleman from Florida said a few moments ago, if we send a message to the world, and that message is that they get a slap on the wrist when the world has seen these kinds of pictures, the question becomes what happens when our military folk or when our civilians are captured? Does it become a tit for tat: If you did it to me, I will do it to you? One of the things we in the Congressional Black Caucus has said over and over again is that we stand up for the moral authority of this country. Not the military authority, the moral authority. And the question certainly becomes have we violated that moral authority when we do not address these problems? Finally, let me say this: that no one will stand behind one of these podiums and even begin to suggest that we have a lot of our military that could fall in the category of the folks who did these kinds of despicable acts. No, we will never do that because we do not believe it. I believe in my heart that 99.9 percent of our military would never engage in this kind of activity and would find it despicable just as the Congressional Black Caucus finds it despicable. But the fact is that we must get to the bottom of this so we also protect their reputations, so that we pull out those who would do these kinds of things so that the others can say, okay, fine, now we have now rid ourselves of those who have no respect for human dignity, who have no respect for the beliefs of others, ","word.count":1985,"sep11":2.71910112359551,"years":2004.57865168539,"days":3410,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.847599342628966,"Topic 2":0.0507713962773954,"Topic 3":0.0107105238553208,"Topic 4":0.02396274999016,"Topic 5":0.0107885544400391,"Topic 6":0.0115937477543593,"Topic 7":0.00851954038188355,"Topic 8":0.0192619100784914,"Topic 9":0.0120176983114135,"Topic 10":0.00477453628197075},{"id":"10419960004434","body":"Jon Fox: Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Shays-Lowey amendment.

Let me state at the outset, I support the rights of law-abiding citizens to own and appropriately use firearms. But this bill has nothing to do with protecting those citizens' rights. Instead, this bill is about protecting rogue gun manufacturers that sell defective products and rogue gun dealers who turn a blind eye to suspicious sales and thefts. The shorthand title for the bill is accurate, the Gun Industry Immunity Act. I won't mince words, this bill gives an entire industry a free pass. In exchange for that free pass, hundreds of thousands of victims across the county will confront closed doors at the courthouse. While I recognize that the bill carves out a set of exceptions of permissible law suits, this is cold comfort. The exceptions are extremely narrow and do not provide reasonable opportunities for legitimate lawsuits to proceed. I am deeply troubled by the fact that this bill will stop pending and future civil lawsuits against the gun industry, including those filed in the wake of the DC Sniper shootings. As the American public well knows, prior to their killing spree, John Muhammad and Lee Malvo allegedly obtained a Bushmaster rifle from a store in Tacoma, Washington, the infamous Bull's Eye Shooter Supply Shop. This rifle was one of 238 weapons that disappeared from the store's inventory over a three year period. More than fifty of those same ``missing'' firearms turned up in crime traces. Civil suits have been filed against Bull's Eye alleging that the store was negligent by failing to keep track of its weapons, and against the gun manufacturer alleging that continuing to supply such dangerous weapons to a store that cannot maintain accurate track is also negligent conduct. But under today's bill, these allegations do not fit the narrow exceptions of permissible suits. Legal experts David Boies and Lloyd N. Cutler, as well as the Congressional Research Service, opine that these sniper suits will be dismissed immediately if the President signs the gun industry immunity act. In real terms this means that the snipers' victims, including Denise Johnson, widow of the Montgomery County bus driver Conrad Johnson, and the family of James ``Sonny'' Buchanan, who was gunned down while mowing the lawn, will have no remedies. Another lawsuit that will be derailed if the gun industry immunity bill passes is a 1999 case against a gun dealer who repeatedly supplied a so-called ``straw purchaser'' with handguns, one of which killed 9- year old Nafis Jefferson in Philadelphia, PA. I was struck by what Nafis' mother said when advised that her lawsuit may be dismissed. She stated, ``Before this happened, I believed in the American dream. You work hard, you have a family, you have a good life. This--this has devastated me. I understand commerce, but there also has to be common sense.'' Under the gun industry immunity bill it is quite likely that a pending suit filed by the families of two New Jersey police officers will be dismissed. The officers' families have sued the gun dealer who sold the gun used to shoot them, one of twelve guns the dealer sold in one transaction, in cash, in circumstances so suspicious that the dealer subsequently called to alert the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Yet rather than having the careful consideration of the facts by judge and jury, today, Congress will decide that Mr. McGuire's and Mr. Lemongello's families cannot pursue any remedies in civil court. A family in Massachusetts will also be denied a right to sue should the Gun Industry Immunity Bill pass. Twenty-six year old Danny Guzman was killed with a 9 mm Kahr Arms gun. The gun was one of a dozen taken from Kahr's unsecured factory, some by the manufacturer's own employee with a criminal record and history of drug abuse. The guns were taken before serial numbers had been stamped on them, making them very difficult to trace. Eventually, a young child found the gun used in Mr. Guzman's death behind an apartment building close to the scene of the shooting. A Massachusetts court found that the suit alleges valid negligence and public nuisance claims against the gun manufacturer and it is set for trial. Yet today's bill would deny Mr. Guzman's family their day in court. Some have characterized the lawsuits against the gun manufacturers and dealers as ``junk'' suits that are cluttering our court houses and bankrupting the industry and thus, justifying this extraordinary solution of blanket civil immunity. But our local, State and Federal judges and court personnel are no where to be found in this debate. No letters or reports document an inundation of firearm lawsuits plugging up the halls of justice. Furthermore, there is no evidence that our State and Federal courts cannot efficiently and effectively manage the pending forearm lawsuits. Indeed, the opposite is true. Look no further than a recently issued opinion by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in which the court addressed the certified question on whether state law created a duty to protect victims of handgun violence from injury caused by illegal gun trafficking. This Court wrote a careful and balanced opinion that fully addressed the issue. As a former Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I am well aware of the complicated and deliberate process courts follow to develop tort law. I am not persuaded that Congress should tread into these waters so adeptly managed by our nation's judges and juries. Gun manufacturers and dealers are not above the law. The gun industry Immunity bill is a radical and unprecedented attempt to undercut common tort law, usurp the responsibilities of judges and juries and most importantly, deny worthy victims of their day in court. I urge my colleagues to vote against S. 1805, and thank the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island for his hard work fighting this bill.","word.count":1002,"sep11":2.53651685393258,"years":2004.39606741573,"days":3345,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.332200764030973,"Topic 2":0.122618060151057,"Topic 3":0.0202357240873089,"Topic 4":0.349312553727261,"Topic 5":0.0171904563251403,"Topic 6":0.0092388312425307,"Topic 7":0.0198370712963296,"Topic 8":0.0316557592107106,"Topic 9":0.0514228353583153,"Topic 10":0.0462879445703731},{"id":"10820030079193","body":"Jeff Bingaman: Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Manhattan Project National Historical Park Study Act. This bill authorizes the National Park Service, in coordination with the Secretaries of Energy and Defense, to undertake a special resource study to assess the national significance, suitability, and feasibility of designating various Manhattan Project sites and their facilities as a National Historical Park. Specifically, the study will evaluate the historic significance of the Manhattan Project facilities of Los Alamos and the Trinity Site in the State of New Mexico, of the Hanford Site in the State of Washington, and of Oak Ridge in the State of Tennessee. I am pleased that my distinguished colleagues from the States of Washington, Senators Cantwell and Murray, are cosponsoring this bill. The significance of the Manhattan Project to this Nation--and indeed the World--would be difficult to overstate. The project was initiated as a desperate effort in the middle of World War II to beat Nazi Germany to the construction of the first nuclear bomb. The effort was of a magnitude and intensity not seen before or since: in a mere three years, 130,000 men and women went to work on a $2.2 billion mission that furiously pushed science, technology, engineering, and society into a new age. The magnitude of the effort is easily matched by its legacy. This legacy includes an ending to the Second World War, as well as the foundation for nuclear medicine and great advances in physics, mathematics, engineering, and technology. A number of scholars have argued that it also includes a dramatic change to a sustained era of relative world peace. But this legacy also includes the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Japanese, and the sacrifices of the homesteaders that were forced off of the sites to make way for the project, its thousands of workers and their families, and the uranium miners, ``down-winders'', and others. This legacy has been the subject of hot debate for decades, and this debate continues today--as it must. There are historic facilities at the four Manhattan Project sites that are absolutely essential resources for informing this important debate, and there should be no question that they are of great national and international significance. Pulitzer Prize-winning Manhattan Project author Richard Rhodes has said that ``the discovery of how to release nuclear energy was arguably the most important human discovery since fire--reason enough to preserve its remarkable history.'' But while the enormous significance of the Manhattan Project makes our obligation to preserve and interpret this history abundantly clear, it makes it equally challenging. The greatest challenge has been--and will continue to be--interpreting this history in a sensitive and balanced way. This Nation is blessed with historic assets that praise the best of humanity and some that mourn the worst, some that grace us with glory and some that humble us with anguish, some that impress us with brilliance and some that embarrass us with senselessness, some that manifest beginnings and some that mark ends, some that inspire us with awe and some that fascinate us with curiosities, and some that grip us with the fear of destruction and some that give us the hope of creation. But I don't know of any others that challenge us with legitimate passions for all of these. Preserving and interpreting this history also includes the challenge of respecting the ongoing missions and responsibilities of the Department of Energy and the Department of Defense at the Manhattan Project sites. Access to some of the historic facilities must be restricted--to some prohibited--and other precautions also may be necessary. The Departments of Energy and Defense have begun to take on these challenges, and they deserve much credit for doing so. The Bradbury Museum in Los Alamos is a good example, as are the biannual tours of the Trinity Site on White Sands Missile Range. They have recognized that preserving this history offers great opportunities not only for the public, but for their employees. Employees who better appreciate this history will be more likely to appreciate their careers, and they certainly will appreciate the boost interested tourists give to their local economies. This bill asks the question whether we will do better to preserve and interpret the important history of the Manhattan Project by unifying and promoting the various efforts at these sites as a National Historical Park. It is appropriate that our Nation's leader in historic preservation and interpretation--the National Park Service--lead the effort to answer this question. In doing so, they will consult with the Secretaries of Energy and Defense, as well as State, tribal, and local officials, and representatives of interested organizations and members of the public. The Park Service's expertise, experience, and enthusiasm is critical to the endeavor. In asking this question we are neither celebrating the Manhattan Project nor lamenting it. But we are recognizing our responsibility to society to ensure it is neither forgotten nor misunderstood. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:","word.count":845,"sep11":2.10393258426966,"years":2003.96348314607,"days":3191,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.167810630849583,"Topic 2":0.0519934159206539,"Topic 3":0.137791983029497,"Topic 4":0.00555128724584153,"Topic 5":0.24408896987239,"Topic 6":0.174090045090733,"Topic 7":0.00588164615764827,"Topic 8":0.203002003644012,"Topic 9":0.00445579777002359,"Topic 10":0.00533422041961724},{"id":"10419960077047","body":"Slade Gorton: Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to authorize a land exchange between the Chelan County PUD, in Washington State and the U.S. Forest Service.

Voinovich: Madam President, I rise in support of the Water Resources Development Act conference report. It has been 6 years since Congress last passed a water resources and development reauthorization bill. The time has come to finally pass this important legislation. I am very disappointed that the President has vetoed this bill. America's infrastructure and waterways system is the foundation of our economy. For too long, we have been ignoring our infrastructure, but Katrina was a wake-up call for all of us. In the wake of this disaster, we saw firsthand the devastating impact of a weak infrastructure on our people and our economy. The more we continue to fail to fund our water infrastructure, the more we are putting our Nation's competitiveness at risk in this global marketplace. Our physical infrastructure is a critical piece to making America more competitive. Our infinite needs are overwhelming and being squeezed. We should be rebuilding an infrastructure of competitiveness so that future generations have at least the same opportunity to enjoy our standard of living and quality of life. If we continue to ignore the upkeep--the deterioration of our locks and dams, flood control projects, and navigation channels--we risk disruptions in waterborne commerce, decreased protection against floods as we saw in Katrina and other environmental damage. Additionally, I am pleased that this bill includes many provisions that will benefit the Great Lakes. First, there is authority for the Corps to deal with a very serious threat facing the Great Lakes. Asian carp are just miles from the lakes, and the only thing standing in their way is a temporary dispersal barrier in the Chicago Ship & Sanitary Canal. This bill authorizes the Corps to complete construction of Barrier II which is the permanent barrier as well as to convert Barrier I into a permanent facility and to operate and maintain both dispersal barriers at full Federal cost. Under this authority, the Corps would study options for hydrologic separation of the canal and the Great Lakes while maintaining the movement of cargo and recreational vessels. This bill clarifies that any reconnaissance study under the Great Lakes Fishery & Ecosystem Restoration program is to be performed at full federal expense. The Great Lakes navigation system has been associated with impacts on Great Lakes fishery resources, and the purpose of the Great Lakes Fishery and Ecosystem Restoration program is for the Corps to cooperate with others to plan, implement, and evaluate projects supporting the restoration of the fishery, ecosystem, and beneficial uses of the Great Lakes. When Congress authorized this program initially, the intention was for the Corps to develop projects under this authority just like other programs. That means that the reconnaissance study is to be a fully federal expense, and cost-sharing is required for subsequent study, engineering, design, and construction. This bill reauthorizes the Great Lakes Remedial Action Plans and Sediment Remediation and the Great Lakes Tributary Models Program. These are two programs that allow the Corps to provide assistance for controlling the source of sediments and to identifying specific actions to resolve pollution problems. Also contained in this bill is authority directing the Corps to expedite the operation and maintenance, including dredging, of the navigation features of the Great Lakes and connecting channels for the purpose of supporting navigation. The Corps has a huge backlog of work, and that backlog includes the Great Lakes. Freighters are getting stuck in shipping channels, other ships are carrying reduced loads, and some shipments have simply ceased altogether. The Corps estimates a backlog of 16 million cubic yards of dredging at commercial Great Lakes harbors and channels, which the Army Corps expects will cost about $192 million to address. In order to help address this backlog, the Corps will be authorized to expedite this work. Lastly, this bill allows the St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation to carry out much-needed repairs, including maintenance dredging, of the Eisenhower and Snell lock facilities and related navigational infrastructure for the St. Lawrence Seaway. Unfortunately, like many of our infrastructure projects, we have not done much upkeep of the St. Lawrence Seaway. This bill will allow for those improvements to be made at a total cost of $134,650,000. The passage of this WRDA conference report cannot be delayed any further. It is simply too important to our Nation in terms of its benefits to our economy and environment and for the speedy recovery for the areas affected by Hurricane Katrina.

I had the honor of serving for 8 years on the Senate Intelligence Committee, where I was vice chairman. I have enormous regard for the current chairman and vice chairman of the committee. I have also served as both ranking member and chairman of the Judiciary Committee. As I listened to the debate, something sounded familiar. Indeed, this amendment was raised during the debate in preparation of the antiterrorism bill that the Congress passed and the President signed last month. There was no enthusiasm for it from Republicans or Democrats. We looked at it, the White House looked at it, and the Justice Department looked at it. None of us were interested in including it in what became the USA Patriot Act. The idea of having a quasi-secret court, and making only limited evidence available to the defendant, as is true under existing law, is constitutionally questionable enough. But to say that we will not tell the defendant any of the evidence against him in the court, as Senator Smith proposes, is the kind of thing we rail against when other countries do it. Our government officials have gone all the way to the head of state level to register complaints when Americans have been held in other countries without being informed of the charges against them. Every President I have known has been forced at one time or another to raise such issues with another head of state. We should not make this task more difficult by approving of the amendment Senator Smith has offered here. Let us look at a little bit of history. The Alien Terrorist Removal Court was created in 1996. It was done largely through the efforts of Senators Hatch and Dole. It exists to provide a way for the Government to remove terrorist aliens whom it believes it cannot attempt to remove through public hearings, to balance the Government's need to maintain its existing intelligence sources while giving some rights to the accused. Under the law as it presently exists, the accused does not see the actual evidence against him but does receive an unclassified summary of that evidence. The law states very clearly that that unclassified summary has to be ``sufficient to enable the alien to prepare a defense.'' Under the amendment that Senator Smith has presented, an alien accused of being a terrorist would receive no information about the basis of the charges against him, not even the limited summary provided in existing law. If we were to pass something of this nature, there is no way the President of the United States or the Secretary of State or the Attorney General could go to any other country holding an American on undisclosed evidence and demand to see that evidence. That nation could simply say that it is doing what the United States, the country seen as the bulwark of freedom, is doing, the United States that has had a written Constitution that has survived for all these years. The U.S. Constitution, as written and interpreted over the last two centuries, makes it clear that the government cannot bring somebody into a court and say: ``We have all this information against you, but we are not going to tell you what it is. Are you guilty of what we have against you? I am not going to tell you what it is we have against you, but I want to know, are you guilty or not? And, if you are not guilty, then defend yourself against these charges we have brought. Sorry, you can't see the charges. Sorry, you can't hear the evidence. Sorry, we can't let you know what is going on. But we will give you a chance to defend yourself.'' It doesn't quite work that way. Anybody in this body who has been either a prosecutor or defense attorney, on either side, would not want that. The distinguished Presiding Officer knows as well as any Senator here the terrible nature of September 11. Her State was impacted in a horrible way, as were the surrounding States of New Jersey and Connecticut, just as the State of Virginia has been horribly harmed by the attack on the Pentagon. Nobody has stated the horror, the anger, and the feelings left in the wake of the September 11 attacks in a more articulate way than the distinguished Presiding Officer. We all share those feelings. But nobody here has ever suggested that we somehow abandon all our laws, all our rules, our Constitution and everything we stand for, the very democracy that got the terrorists to attack us. In effect, we would say, ``We surrender.'' The Senator from New York, the Senator from Vermont, the Senator from Florida, all 100 of us--none of us is about to surrender. We understand there is a problem with terrorism. I suspect throughout my lifetime we will face threats. But let's answer the threats in the ways that comport with what our constitutional history and our history as a nation. The Alien Terrorist Removal Court has not been used, but that is not because an unclassified summary has to be provided to the defendant. The Justice Department talked to us about why the court is not being used, and did not mention this. When the Department was given the opportunity to consider this amendment at the time of the terrorism bill, it did not want it. I suspect that this lack of interest is related to concerns within the Justice Department about constitutional challenges to the court itself, as it is formulated under existing law. Surely the Justice Department knows that if we approve this amendment those constitutional challenges will basically be irrefutable. We provide substantial new powers to the Justice Department with regard to terrorist aliens through the antiterrorism legislation we just passed, legislation I voted for, the distinguished senior Senator from Florida voted for, his colleague, the other Senator from Florida voted for; the distinguished Presiding Officer voted for it--98 of us voted for it. That legislation should make it easier for the Justice Department to use this court. But as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I could never support this amendment, which has already been rejected once by the administration and by Republicans and Democrats who negotiated the antiterrorism bill. I certainly could not accept it absent any showing of why it is needed. I say to my friend from Florida, the distinguished chairman, that I have no problem calling upon the administration to notify the Judiciary Committee if it really believes a change in the law is needed. The administration did not believe this a couple of weeks ago. But if the Attorney General now believes he needs something such as this, I will be glad to hold hearings on the issue and bring his concerns forward. But to do something of such constitutional magnitude in an amendment on the floor, without any hearings in the Judiciary Committee or Intelligence Committee, is simply inappropriate. Madam President, we need to go back to basic constitutional law 101 here. The idea of giving the government the ability to bring removal proceedings against someone and force him to defend himself without telling him of the evidence against him flies in the face of all of our principles. We must not tell the rest of the world that the only way we can defend ourselves is to accuse somebody but not tell him what the evidence is against him. Back in the 1700s, we fought a revolution to ensure a much different principle. All of us share the terror of what happened. All of us are opposed to terrorists. All of us want to defend the United States. But we must not let our enthusiasm to defend our Nation lead us to do things that will hurt us further. Frankly, I would be delighted to have the Attorney General take a look at Senator Smith's amendment and see what he thinks. But I tell my friend from Florida that I certainly do not support this amendment, because the constitutional questions raised are of such enormous magnitude. To do so without any request from the administration and without any hearings would not be a responsible action for this body to take. I yield the floor.","word.count":1406,"sep11":0.162921348314607,"years":2002.02247191011,"days":2500,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.241658469047883,"Topic 2":0.223851298052492,"Topic 3":0.00536301606531236,"Topic 4":0.440980869234045,"Topic 5":0.00248209200350672,"Topic 6":0.00202782659982972,"Topic 7":0.00475075118652229,"Topic 8":0.00319694742690031,"Topic 9":0.0736219170226706,"Topic 10":0.00206681336083833},{"id":"10620000036002","body":"Barney Frank: Mr. Speaker, I note with dismay but unfortunately not with surprise that the hate crimes bill which got a majority vote in both houses is absent from this bill.

You are in the habit of thinking wrong. I am in mid-sentence, but I am not surprised to be interrupted. We have other business we are taking care of. I have to soon excuse myself to go to the Judiciary Committee hearing, where we are taking up the question of electronic surveillance, where we have been in session listening to the Attorney General since 9:30 this morning. When the Judiciary Committee had taken up this bill, we took it up under very difficult circumstances. We started last year with the immediate job of confirming the Attorney General. The Senate went into session on the 109th Congress on a Tuesday, and we had the Attorney General in on Thursday and confirmed him in short order. Then we moved through the bankruptcy bill and the class action bill. Then we tackled the very tough problem of the filibusters, which had delayed the confirmation of circuit judges. We worked through that problem. Then in the midst of all that, we had a series of hearings on a wide variety of issues: Miller, the New York Times reporter who was kept, and the business about identity theft. We worked through hearings on the tough immigration problem. Then we took up the issue of the confirmation of Chief Justice Roberts, where the staff of the committee worked through the month of August; then we took up the question of the confirmation of Justice Alito. We worked through the months of December and January. While people were globe trotting around the world, we were at work on those matters. And through it all, we have produced a bill that is solid. It is a bill which is designed to compensate thousands of victims of asbestos. One thing the Senator from Nevada was right about: Mesothelioma is a killer. But the thing he is wrong about is that his position will allow these people to be killed without compensation, because their companies have gone bankrupt, some 77 of them. We have moved to this trust fund after decades and decades of work. I first saw this issue when Senator Gary Hart brought Johns Manville into my office in the early 1980s, 1982 or 1983, and this asbestos problem has defied solution, just defied solution--until Senator Hatch came up with the concept of this trust fund. Then the trust fund was increased in size from about $90 billion to $140 billion. I didn't hear the Senator from Nevada object when the former Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, agreed with Senator Frist that $140 billion was the accurate figure. I didn't hear him object at all. The only time I hear him object is when there is some chance--and it is an uphill fight; I am prepared to concede that, but I am used to them. I am used to uphill fights. I might even say I enjoy them. But this is the first time this issue has come to the floor of the Senate. It has been languishing for decades, and I talked to no one who denies the basic fact that there is a problem that ought to be addressed. I think even the Senator from Nevada, with his vitriol and slander, implicitly concedes it is a major problem that ought to be addressed. Now, a motion to proceed takes up the issue as to whether you ought to consider the bill. If the Senator from Nevada has valid amendments, I would like to see them. If he has a better bill, I would like to see that. I would vote for anybody's bill that is better than this one because we have to address the issue. When he talks about the Budget Committee, there are some technical problems here because the money goes through the Department of Labor, so it is a Federal expenditure, but it is not Government money; it is money contributed by the insurers and the manufacturers. There is no impact on the budget. This bill is ironclad to eliminate any possibility of Federal funding. But if you want to use obstructionist tactics and filibuster-- the Senator from Nevada is good at that--if you want to use 60 votes to try to kill it on a motion to proceed, so be it. I know what the rules are here. But there is no reason not to proceed, and there is every reason to proceed. If you want to use the 60-vote technicality to sustain a budget point of order, you can do that, too. But there is no adverse impact on the Federal budget. I regret I cannot stay and engage in this colloquy. I do have to get back to the Judiciary Committee. I ask unanimous consent that the text of my full statement be printed in the Record. Mr. President, again, this is S. 852, the Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act of 2005, FAIR Act, the successor to S. 1125 and S. 2290, the FAIR Acts of 2003 and 2004. My colleagues, Senator Frist, Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy, deserve enormous credit for the drafting of these acts and for the development of this legislation. There is a will in the Senate to enact legislation to end the ongoing rash of bankruptcies; to prevent the diversion of resources from those who are truly sick; to preserve jobs and pensions; and to solve the worst litigation crisis in the history of the American judicial system. The Senate plainly wants a more rational asbestos claims system, and I believe that this legislation offers a realistic prospect of accomplishing that result. This legislation provides substantial assurances of acceptable compensation to asbestos victims and substantial assurances to manufacturers and insurers to resolve, with finality, asbestos claims. Over the past three decades, a solution to the asbestos crisis has eluded Congress and the courts. Some 77 companies have gone bankrupt, thousands of individuals who have been exposed to asbestos have deadly diseases--mesothelioma and other such ailments--and are not being compensated or because of the unfairness of the current system, see little of the awards they do win. A May 10, 2005, report released by the RAND Institute for Civil Justice estimates that nonmalignants make up about 90 percent of the litigation and most are unimpaired. According to RAND, the number of claims continues to rise, with over 730,000 claims filed already and some 200,000 pending. The number of asbestos defendants also has risen sharply, from about 300 in the 1980s, to more than 8,400 today and most are users of the product, not its manufacturers. These companies represent 85 percent of the U.S. economy and nearly every U.S. industry; including automakers, ship builders, textile mills, retailers, insurers, electric utilities and virtually any company involved in manufacturing or construction in the last 30 years. Asbestos leaves many victims in its wake. First and foremost, the sick and their families have suffered and do not receive fair compensation in the tort system. Asbestos victims filing claims receive an average of 42 cents for every $1 spent on asbestos litigation. Today, 31 cents of every $1 have gone to defense costs, and 27 cents have gone to plaintiffs' attorneys and other related costs. The flawed asbestos litigation system not only hurts the sick and their chances of receiving fair compensation but also claims other victims. These include employees, retirees and shareholders of affected companies whose jobs, savings and retirement plans are jeopardized by the tide of asbestos cases. With asbestos litigation affecting so many companies, this also impacts the overall economy, including jobs, pensions, stock prices, tax revenues and insurance costs. According to a 2002 study by Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz, asbestos bankruptcies have cost nearly 60,000 workers their jobs and $200 million in lost wages. Employees' retirement funds have shrunken by 25 percent. In July 2003, the Judiciary Committee voted out S. 1125, a bill with numerous problems, largely along party lines, 10 yeas, 8 nays, 1 pass, in an effort to move the legislation. S. 1125 created the basic structure of the legislation, and made huge strides in working out the medical criteria. However, the bill foundered on other issues. In August, at my request, Judge Edward R. Becker, a Federal judge for 34 years, convened in his chambers in Philadelphia the so-called stakeholders; namely, manufacturers, labor, AFL-CIO, insurers and trial lawyers--to determine if some common ground could be found. Until the preceding May, Judge Becker had been the Chief Judge of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals and wrote the opinion in the asbestos class action suit that was affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court. From September 2003 through January 2005, there were some 36 stakeholder meetings held in my conference room, with Judge Becker as a pro-bono mediator, usually attended by 25 to 40 representatives with sometimes over 75 people present. I have also met 61 times since January 2005 with various officials from the administration, members of the Senate Judiciary Committee and their staffs, the Senate leadership and other Senators all in an effort to move this bill forward. Judge Becker and I have sought an equitable bill which took into account, to the maximum extent possible, the concerns of the stakeholders and to get their input on drafting of the bill. After analysis and deliberation, we found we could accommodate many of the competing interests. This process commenced with the blessing of then-Chairman Hatch and Ranking Member Leahy of the Judiciary Committee. This extended process allowed the stakeholders an extraordinary ``hearing'' process and really amounted to the longest ``mark-up'' in Senate history although not in the customary framework. We have had the cooperation of many Senators. Senators Hatch and Leahy have had representatives at all the meetings. The majority leader, Senator Hatch, and Senator Leahy have addressed this ``working group'' at our meetings. Senator Hatch's and Senator Leahy's representatives have been active participants at every meeting, as well as the members of the staffs of Senators Baucus, Biden, Brownback, Burns, Carper, Chafee, Chambliss, Coburn, Cornyn, Craig, DeWine, Dodd, Durbin, Feingold, Feinstein, Graham, Grassley, Hagel, Kennedy, Kohl, Kyl, Landrieu, Levin, Lincoln, Murra","word.count":417,"sep11":4.29213483146067,"years":2006.15168539326,"days":3970,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.168726308308649,"Topic 2":0.180278825396273,"Topic 3":0.0259440848886631,"Topic 4":0.0218124491644026,"Topic 5":0.175767869181816,"Topic 6":0.0141153268343196,"Topic 7":0.255035453221107,"Topic 8":0.122706928088421,"Topic 9":0.0210496979285534,"Topic 10":0.0145630569877953},{"id":"10920060051903","body":"Mitch McConnell: Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it stand in adjournment until 9:30 a.m. tomorrow, Thursday, June 15; I further ask that following the prayer and the pledge the morning hour be deemed to have expired, the Journal of the proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved, and the Senate then proceed to a period of morning business until 10 a.m., with the time equally divided between majority leader or his designee, and the Democratic leader or his designee, with the first half under the control of the majority and the second half under the control of the minority.

I can tell you the number of poor children in my State is higher by far than the national average. What I am saying is that if you want to address the problems of poor people, go where the poor people are, not where the people are more affluent. That is the reason I object; I object to these staggering sums going to the other States. In 1994, Arkansas had a terrible Medicaid shortage of funds. We could not come up with our matching share to the extent that was necessary to provide health care for all of our poor children. Do you know what the State legislature did under the Governor's leadership? They passed one of the most unpopular taxes you can pass in any State. It was a nickel a bottle on soft drinks, and the money it raised kept us from kicking people out of nursing homes, and it kept us from having poor children on the streets who need health care and are not able to get it. That is the reason I am complaining today. It was a monumental effort on the part of Arkansas to come up with our share of the money so we could take care of our children. So here we have a formula that says in the future you are going to get $390 a year per poor child. And there are 38 additional States that will be hurt by this bill. You would think it would be adopted with flying colors. If I may continue with the article from Mr. Ellwood of the New York Times: Here is a man who spent his entire life studying this problem. He closes this article by saying: Mr. President, I spoke about election-year issues the other day in the Energy Committee, on which I sit, when we were dealing with the Boundary Water Canoe Wilderness Area, about 1,100 lakes along the Minnesota-Canadian border. I went out there in 1978 for Wendy Anderson, who was serving in the Senate from the State of Minnesota at the time and with whom I served as Governor. The Boundary Water Canoe Wilderness Area came up the year Wendy was running for re-election. It was a big political issue. Wendy lost his seat, not for that reason only. But he lost plenty of votes because of the Boundary Water Canoe Wilderness Area dispute. Now we have another big Boundary Water Canoe Wilderness Area dispute in Minnesota. I am not taking sides on that necessarily, but there are a lot of ads being run in Minnesota right now. I said in the committee--and I mean it--I will do everything I can to keep a bill of this kind from passing this year, because it is entirely too important for the U.S. Congress to be dealing with in an election year. That is exactly the way I feel about this welfare bill. It ought to be passed next year, not now in an election year where everybody is trying to grow hair on their chest to prove they are tougher on welfare than everyone else. But we are not going to wait. As a consequence, we are getting ready to pass a bad bill. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article by David T.

I'm very must opposed to the income tax treaties that are now awaiting action in the Senate. But my opposition stems more from the Treasury Department's stated interpretation of the pending treaties than the actual language in the treaties themselves. Treasury Department officials interpret one article in each of these treaties as preventing the United States from scrapping its outdated arm's length enforcement approach on corporate income tax and replacing it [[Page S 12201]] with the simple and time-proven formula method, which is now the norm between the States. In my judgment, this interpretation by the Treasury Department is wrong-headed and is ill-advised. I believe that the Federal Government is losing billions of dollars in revenues because the IRS uses the so-called arm's-length method to enforce our corporate tax laws. In my judgment, this IRS enforcement tool is unworkable and results in massive tax avoidance by international firms operating here. It keeps our tax officials in the Dark Ages as they work to ensure that multinational firms doing business here pay their fair share of U.S. taxes. There is evidence to suggest a massive hemorrhaging of tax revenues because of transfer pricing abuses and because of the flawed arm's- length pricing method employed by the IRS. The General Accounting Office [GAO] has reported that more than 73 percent of the foreign firms doing business in this country pay no U.S. taxes, despite generating hundreds of billions of dollars in revenues every year. There are also several independent studies of the problem that estimate U.S. revenue losses ranging from $2 billion to $40 billion a year. I happen to think that this country is losing between $10 and $15 billion in revenues from foreign-based firms alone. But I recognize that there hasn't been a comprehensive and official government study that attempts to pinpoint the true size of the U.S. tax gap caused by transfer pricing abuses and to map out the best approach to plug the gap. I have in recent days been working with Treasury officials on this matter. In response to my request, Treasury Department has now agreed to formally conduct a joint conference and study with the State governments to evaluate the U.S. tax revenues lost due to transfer pricing abuses, especially from foreign firms doing business in the United States. In addition, this initiative will examine the issue of implementing a Federal formulary apportionment system to enforce our international tax laws. This joint Treasury/State initiative will, I hope, finally answer the questions of how much money we are now losing from transfer pricing abuses, and how we can take steps to prevent it.","word.count":455,"sep11":-6.24719101123596,"years":1995.61235955056,"days":218,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.866224261118552,"Topic 2":0.064508823914466,"Topic 3":0.00800102768674618,"Topic 4":0.0162511925649693,"Topic 5":0.00943520261200023,"Topic 6":0.0073800546786253,"Topic 7":0.00609779991672562,"Topic 8":0.010858229118081,"Topic 9":0.0078981988833968,"Topic 10":0.00334520950643765},{"id":"11020070058286","body":"Kevin McCarthy: Without objection, it is so ordered","word.count":231,"sep11":6.42977528089888,"years":2008.2893258427,"days":4731,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0153375027735908,"Topic 2":0.27708849506649,"Topic 3":0.00628160704259713,"Topic 4":0.00197101991236037,"Topic 5":0.160742173843847,"Topic 6":0.244710267591543,"Topic 7":0.00193419801782768,"Topic 8":0.117450735538838,"Topic 9":0.058588727028081,"Topic 10":0.115895273184825},{"id":"10820040038740","body":"Trent Lott: Mr. President, let me first commend and congratulate Senator Roberts, the chairman of our Select Committee on Intelligence, for the leadership he is giving on that very important committee. It is a very important and difficult assignment. I thought his statement today was a very good one. I jokingly said, but I meant it sincerely, I could not quite tell when he went from quoting Churchill to speaking for himself because the eloquence was very close. He makes a plea that is so important, and that is: Do not prejudge what the subcommittee is going to do. Members of the Intelligence Committee should not prejudge the information we are going to receive in the staff report. We should work together to see what we have and what conclusions we reach and what should be done. That is our job. I acknowledge that this is another in a series of what has been described in many different ways but I just refer to it as ``oops'' hearings--oops, we missed something here. But it has been going on for years. There was not a clear indication of what was happening in the Soviet Union, that they were imploding economically and they did not have the strength we thought they did in the defense area. We had Khobar Towers. We have had a series of events that our intelligence did not pick up. Once again, we find ourselves now, with the 9/11 Commission, working to see what we missed perhaps in our intelligence and law enforcement community before 9/11. It should not be approached, though, with the idea of condemning some particular individual but finding out what happened: Why did we not do a better job? What did we not know? And more importantly, what are we going to do about it? I am tired of oops hearings that happen after the fact and nothing really changes. Are we going to make a real change this time? Can we do a better job with our intelligence, and our intelligence community? I think we can. By the way, when we start pointing a finger of blame, we better look in the mirror first. We have had these intelligence committees since the 1970s. We have known that their budget has not been adequate through much of the 1990s. We have known that we lost our ability to have human intelligence, people on the ground. It became politically incorrect in the 1970s to have the head of, say, a financial institution in Buenos Aires to be headed by an American who was an agent, or a journalist who was working for a newspaper but was an agent. We have made it extremely difficult. We have become too caught up in sophistication, thinking we could get enough with satellites or with technology. It is not enough. I think what we need to do is lower the rhetoric. I know this is a political year, an election year. Everything is going to be somewhat political on both sides, but can we spare one thing, just one thing, from the political agenda? Can we not separate out intelligence and how we support it? Can that not be bipartisan? Now there is a call for an independent commission. We have even dropped ``bipartisan.'' Now it is ``independent.'' Who decides that it is independent? Some people are indicating if the President calls for an independent commission, one to which he appoints good men and women, that is not independent, but if it is one established by the Congress where we name Republicans and Democrats; that is independent. Quit the blame game. Ask legitimate questions. Work together. Draw conclusions and, more importantly, take action. Intelligence is so critical. In some respects it is even more critical than defense spending, because if we do not have good intelligence and if we do not have a reliable intelligence apparatus that works with our defense, our men and women are exposed to uncertainty, unknown difficulty, and death. We are talking about the lives of young men and women. Is it good that we are condemning and revealing information about the quality of our intelligence community while our men and women are today in Iraq, Afghanistan, and all over the world, who are relying on the ability of our agents, the CIA, the DIA, the different organizations we have doing intelligence?

So it is with great pride that I rise to honor the 400 air men and women of the Air Force's 819th RED HORSE Squadron. About one-half of this squadron is deploying today for training in Wisconsin before going to Iraq later this year. Over the last decade, Malmstrom Air Force Base in Great Falls, MT, has been the home of the 819th RED HORSE Squadron. For the uninitiated, RED HORSE stands for rapid engineer deployable heavy operation repair squadron engineer. Basically, these are the men and women who rebuild Air Force facilities overseas, such as runways. They also have spent considerable time in Iraq rebuilding schools and homes. These are men and women who do some truly wonderful work. In a previous deployment to Iraq in 2005, the squadron was involved in 130 construction projects on 12 different bases in Iraq. The 819th has served in Afghanistan and Qatar. In every place they have taken on complicated engineering projects for the U.S. Government but have also done outstanding work with locals to rehabilitate housing and provide residents with everything from coloring books for kids to new washing machines. It is a combination of accomplishment, strength, and generosity that represents the best of our Nation. This afternoon, as the men and women of the 819th begin to train for the mission that will send them to Iraq, they leave behind spouses, children, and other family members. We know that piano recitals and football games will be missed this fall. There will be an empty chair at too many holiday meals. The 819th is an Active Associate unit, meaning that it is compromised of both Active-Duty airmen and Air National Guardsmen. For the citizen soldiers of our Air Guard, these deployments can be especially difficult, and I hope all Montanans will keep these airmen and their families in their thoughts and prayers. And when they return home, we have a moral responsibility to care for the folks who have worn the uniform of our country. Whether they return to Active Duty or reenter civilian life, the Federal Government must support them. Congress has taken numerous steps this year to provide more resources for the VA and to improve the quality of life for our troops. I hope we will continue to make progress in these areas so that when the 819th comes home we are able to welcome these airmen back home with our deeds and not just our words.","word.count":464,"sep11":6.15449438202247,"years":2008.01404494382,"days":4633,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0749589851624813,"Topic 2":0.0388208754552006,"Topic 3":0.380211136743649,"Topic 4":0.00874346344035179,"Topic 5":0.0161771783224635,"Topic 6":0.0416336705600362,"Topic 7":0.00412236569612399,"Topic 8":0.411365365790868,"Topic 9":0.014632037131041,"Topic 10":0.00933492169778431},{"id":"11020080008336","body":"John Shimkus: Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague bringing up the issue of energy and the connection of energy to this bill because that is what we intend to do here today. The irony behind this debate is that Americans really appreciate healthy beaches; but what they are really mad about is high gas prices. I have three kids, 15, 13 and 8. My wife is driving them all over the world to attend every event that kids do today, and the soccer moms of the world are outraged over the price of gas that they are paying. And what has this Democrat majority been doing to continue to affect the price of gas, we just heard it, let's take more assets off the ability to explore. We just heard it from my colleague who just said no more exploration for oil. Where is the plan that the Speaker touted would lower gas prices? That was over 700 days ago. We want answers. We want this majority to do something about the high cost of gasoline. We have truck drivers prepared to strike over the price of diesel, $4 a gallon gasoline is on the horizon, and this majority is doing nothing, nothing. Here is the energy plan: When you have no energy plan, you plan to fail. When this majority took over, the price of a barrel of crude oil was $58. What is it today, $110 per barrel. That translates into a gasoline price of originally $2.33 a gallon to now, $3.34, $3.50, $3.75, and $4. At $3.44, that is a $1.01 increase since this majority took over. Where is the energy plan to lower gasoline prices? The Speaker's plan means that you pay more in energy costs in this country. The beaches that are affected in this legislation, Great Lakes, the coastal beaches, guess what, if I want to take advantage of these healthy beaches, I would have to drive about 285 miles to get to the Great Lakes. I would have to drive a lot farther, almost 745 miles to get to the gulf coast. Last year the cost to Chicago would be about $53. This year the cost is $76. We lose discretionary income when we allow gas prices to go up. Another connection, to go to the great State of Florida to take my family on a vacation, that would have cost me last year $138 to drive. This year, $200 to drive. Do you think that is not going to affect the economy of the Florida coastal areas? Do you think that is going to halt our folks going to your State, my friend from Miami, to enjoy these great, healthy beaches. My folks can't afford to drive to these beaches to enjoy them anymore. And what is the Democrat plan for gas prices? Silence. Nothing. The only plan is the plan to fail. The only plan is higher prices. Here it is: $58 a barrel when you came in, $110 a barrel today. Let me give you some quotes. Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on April 24, 2006, ``Democrats have a commonsense plan to bring down skyrocketing gas prices.'' Well, these skyrocketing prices aren't going down, folks. Speaker Pelosi's plan is to have skyrocketing price increases for gasoline, not decreases. We got it wrong. It's this whole change mentality. Change is good. Change can be bad. The change in this majority has been bad for the cost of energy in this country. And what are we doing? We're talking about healthy beaches. Healthy beaches. We ought to be talking about the price of gasoline. We ought to be talking about the price of diesel fuel. We ought to be talking about the price of electricity generation, nuclear power, clean coal technology. But no, healthy beaches. I hope my folks can enjoy and benefit by these healthy beaches. It's been days since Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said, ``Democrats believe that we can do more for the American people who are struggling to deal with high gas prices.'' Mr. Majority leader, what did you do? You raised prices. You didn't decrease prices. You raised prices. Everyone knows that prices have gone up. Truckers are going to strike over record diesel prices. Diesel this week was at an average of more than $4 a gallon in Oregon and Washington, and nearly $4.12.","word.count":724,"sep11":6.75,"years":2008.6095505618,"days":4845,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.140314920693031,"Topic 2":0.303505505093938,"Topic 3":0.0127358874781359,"Topic 4":0.0118684284120362,"Topic 5":0.0434479382676525,"Topic 6":0.0214840225952954,"Topic 7":0.109375148478374,"Topic 8":0.174716209465345,"Topic 9":0.13586135240084,"Topic 10":0.0466905871153532},{"id":"10720020044526","body":"Charles Grassley: Opportunity is the greatest of human rights anywhere in the world.

Like him, I am unburdened with a legal education, but like him I believe I can read the English language, and that I have spent some time studying not only the Constitution but the history behind it. In the spirit of the remarks that have been made here, I add a few comments of my own. It is very clear to me from studying the history of the first amendment that the primary concern of the Founders was to prevent the creation of State churches in the various States. There was never any movement to have a national church, but there were movements on the part of some of the individual States to have State churches. One of the reasons for the fact that there was not a national movement was that different States were dominated by different religions. For example, the Puritans who came to what became the State of Massachusetts came to flee persecution they found in Europe. Then once they had established their colony in Massachusetts, they proceeded to persecute those who didn't agree with them. One of them, Roger Williams, went over to found what is now the State of Rhode Island, and created in Rhode Island a bastion of religious liberty about which the Senator from Rhode Island instructed a group of us at noon today. I found his presentation to be very interesting and worthwhile. So a national religion covering all 13 States united in the United States of America was never in the cards. But there were some who felt that individual States might adopt a State church in that particular State, in one particular State or another. The Founding Fathers in the first amendment made it clear that there must not be a State church in any of the individual States. That was the driving force behind the words in the first amendment. There are those in today's society who read the first amendment and its prescription of freedom of religion to mean that the Government should guarantee everyone freedom from religion, that the Government should vigorously put down any reference to religion that takes place in the public square. I think that is a misreading of the Founders' intention, and I think that particular notion is behind the recent court ruling that has given rise to the speeches we have heard here on the floor. I want to make one other observation about this, as long as I have the floor. America is known as a religious country. As I travel abroad and deal with some of our European friends, I find many of them to be perplexed by that. Indeed, one religious commentator said to me that if you are religious in Europe, you will be treated with disdain. Europe has now entered its post-Christian era. That is a very interesting statement, to think that Europe went through a pre-Christian era, then a Christian era, and now it is in a post-Christian period. When you go throughout the great cities of Europe and look at the many churches, you find that most of them have been turned into concert halls, or tourist attractions, and they are not used for religious purposes anymore. So why is Europe turning away from religion where America remains a strongly religious nation? I am sure there are many reasons, but the one that strikes me as cogent is the fact that we have never had a State church here in America. That means religions in America have had to compete for adherence in the public square on the basis of their doctrine, on the basis of their humanity and compassion, on the basis of their attractiveness to those who might want to affiliate with them, whereas in Europe you are required by law to join a particular church in a particular country. When the government and the church become intertwined together in that fashion, even to the point where the government provides funds for the church, that makes it unnecessary for the church to appeal to its adherents sufficiently that they will support it out of their own pocketbook, you get a corruption of both. It was very interesting to me to travel to Russia after the Soviet Union collapsed and spend some time talking with Russian officials about this very issue. The Russian Parliament had passed an act which I believed was violative of the notion of freedom of religion and I went over to visit with them to talk to them about it. After having visits with members of the Duma as well as members of the Yeltsin administration and their justice department, I was assured they would lean on the concept of freedom of religion and that the law would not be used in any way to persecute certain religions that had come in from outside, once the Iron Curtain was over and religions were made welcome there. But the interesting conversation out of all of that in the context of what I am saying here came from some individuals who were talking about the role of the Russian Orthodox Church in Russian life. After the fall of the Soviet Union, the Russians were making an effort to identify themselves once again as something other than Communists, trying to figure out who they were, asking the fundamental question: What does it mean to be a Russian? Of course, the members of the Russian Orthodox Church hierarchy said being a member of the Russian Orthodox Church is important to being a Russian, but they also said we do not want to be a State church again. We have been there, and we know how debilitating it is for the church to have government involvement in our affairs and to have government financing our affairs. As we have this debate over the words that go into the pledge--a debate that I think will ultimately be settled in the courts one way or the other, and if the precedent is as it has been, the words ``under God'' will be retained in the pledge--let us take the occasion to remember why we have such religious strength in this country. It is the fact that we have had freedom of religion, and we have had different denominations competing in the public square for their various adherents and not depending upon the Government for funding or direction, unlike many of the countries in Europe. America is not in its post-Christian era the way Europe is, and, ironically, I think one of the reasons is because America has never had a government dictation of what that would mean, what religion ought to be. But again, even as we celebrate freedom of religion, I hope we don't go so far as to have Government dictate freedom from religion and tell us that we must in some way or other, however subtle, persecute people of faith. I had the honor of receiving an honorary degree at one of our universities, and the commencement speaker was the Catholic bishop of the area served by that university. He made the point that he respects, and it is required by our Constitution to respect, all of those who disagree with him and have made the choice not to worship anyone. But he said, I only ask in return that they extend to me the same respect for the fact that I have chosen to worship and that they do not use Government affairs to persecute me for having chosen to believe, just as I say we must not use Government agencies to persecute those who have chosen not to believe. I yield the floor.","word.count":1289,"sep11":4.11516853932584,"years":2005.97471910112,"days":3907,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0176329115566735,"Topic 2":0.213220314033048,"Topic 3":0.00382574447950688,"Topic 4":0.0782972427518022,"Topic 5":0.00328448150233783,"Topic 6":0.00247348907127489,"Topic 7":0.549861397176287,"Topic 8":0.00481213708577383,"Topic 9":0.122514871299297,"Topic 10":0.00407741104399804},{"id":"10820030021453","body":"Earl Blumenauer: Mr. Chairman, the amendment is very simple and concerns recent events in the Darfur region of Sudan, which I visited last week. I offer the amendment on behalf of myself and the gentleman from New Jersey . The amendment asks the Secretary of State to support the investigations of war crimes or crimes against humanity in Darfur, and I have done this in consultation with my colleague on the other side, the gentleman from New York . Senator Brownback and I just returned from spending 3 days and 2 nights in Darfur, Sudan. During our trip we visited five refugee camps: Abu Shouk; Tawilah; Krinding; Sisi and Morney--all sprawling tent cities jam-packed with thousands of displaced families and fast becoming breeding grounds for disease and sickness. We drove past dozens of pillaged villages and walked through what was left of four burned to the ground. We heard countless stories about rape, murder and plunder. We talked to rape victims. We saw the scars on men who had been shot. We watched mothers cradle their sick and dying babies, hoping against all odds that their children would survive. We saw armed Janjaweed waiting to prey on innocent victims along the perimeter of refugee camps. We saw Janjaweed--who are carrying out these attacks--sitting astride camels and horses just a short distance from where young and old have sought what they had hoped would be a safe harbor. The same stories were repeated at every camp we visited. The raids would happen early in the morning. First comes the low rumble of a Soviet-made Antonov plane to bomb the village. Next come helicopter gunships to strafe the village with the huge machine guns mounted on each side. Sometimes the helicopters would land and unload supplies for the Janjaweed. They would then be reloaded with booty confiscated from a village. One man told us he saw cows being loaded onto one helicopter. The Janjaweed, some clad in military uniforms, would come galloping in on horseback and camels to finish the job of killing, raping, stealing and plundering. Walking through the burned out villages we could tell the people living there had little or not time to react. They left everything they owned--lanterns, cookware, water jugs, pottery, plows--and ran for their lives. There was no time to stop and bury their dead. The Janjaweed made certain that there would be nothing left for the villagers to come home to. Huts were torched. Donkeys, goats and cows were stolen, slaughtered. Grain containers destroyed. In one village we saw where the Janjaweed even burned the mosque. What is happening in Darfur is rooted in ethnic cleansing. Religion has nothing to do with what unfolded over the last year. It was clear that only villages inhabited by black African Muslims were being targeted. Arab villages sitting just next to African ones miles from the nearest towns have been left unscathed. While government officials are adamant in saying there is no connection between the Government of Sudan and the Janjaweed, the militiamen we saw did not look like skilled pilots who could fly planes or helicopters. We also were told the Janjaweed are well armed and well supplied. They have satellite phones, an astonishing fact considering most people in the far western provinces of Darfur have probably never even seen or walked on a paved road. The impunity under which the Janjaweed operate was most telling as we approached the airport in Geneina on our last day in the region for our flight back to Khartoum. In plain sight was an encampment of Janjaweed within shouting distance of a contingent of Government of Sudan regulars. No more than 200 yards separated the two groups. Sitting on the tarmac were two helicopter gunships and a Russian-made Antonov plane. The situation in Darfur is being described as the worst humanitarian crisis in the world today. We agree. But sadly things could get worse. Some say that even under the best of circumstances, as many as 300,000 Darfuris forced from their homes are expected to die from malnutrition and diarrhea or diseases such as malaria and cholera in the coming months. The impending rainy season presents its own set of problems, making roads impassable for food deliveries and the likelihood of disease increasing dramatically with the heavy rains. Abu Shouk was the first of five IDP camps we visited. More than 40,000 people live in this sprawling tent city. Families arriving at the camps--almost all after walking for days in the hot sun from their now abandon villages-- are only given a tarp, a water jug, cookware and a small amount of grain. At Mornay, the largest of the IDP camps in Darfur with more than 70,000 inhabitants, it was hard not to step in either human or animal feces as we walked. In a few weeks, when the heavy rains begin, excrement will flow across the entire camp. Mortality from diarrhea, which we were told represents one-third of the deaths in the camps, will only increase. To their credit, all the non-governmental organizations that have been allowed to operate in Darfur have done--and continue to do--a tremendous job under extremely trying circumstances. Rapes, we were told, happen almost daily to the women who venture outside the confines of the camps in search of firewood and straw. They leave very early in the morning, hoping to evade their tormentors before they awake. With the camps swelling in size and nearby resources dwindling, they often walk several miles. The farther the women go from the camp, the greater the risk of being attacked by the Janjaweed. As we approached Mornay, we saw a number of Janjaweed resting with their camels and horses along the perimeter of the camp, easily within walking distance. In one camp we heard the horrific story of four young girls--two of whom were sisters--who had been raped just days before we arrived. They had left the camp to collect straw to feed the family's donkey when they were attacked. They said their attackers told them they were slaves and that their skin was too dark. As they were being raped, they said the Janjaweed told them they were hoping to make more lighter-skinned babies. We were told that some of the rape victims were being branded on their back and arms by the Janjaweed, permanently labeling the women. We also received a letter during our trip from a group of women who were raped. To protect them from further attacks, we purposely do not mention where they are from or list their names. The translation is heartbreaking: These rape victims have nowhere to turn. Even if they report the attacks to the police, they know nothing will happen. The police, the military and the Janjaweed all appear to be acting in coordination. The situation in Darfur is dire, and from what we could see, it is entirely man-made. These people who had managed to survive even the severest droughts and famines during the course of their long history are now in mortal danger of being wiped out simply because of the darker shade of their skin color. Over the course of 3 days, we saw the worst of man's inhumanity to man, but we also saw the best of what it means to be human: mothers waiting patiently for hours in the hot sun so that they could try to save their babies; NGO aid workers and volunteer doctors feeding and caring for the sick and the dying; and the courage and bravery of men, women and children eager to talk to us so that we would know their story. The world made a promise in 1994 to never again allow the systematic destruction of a people or race. ``Never again''--words said, too, after the Holocaust. In Darfur, the international community has a chance to stop history from repeating itself. It also has a chance to end this nightmare for those who have found a way to survive. If the international community fails to act, the next cycle of this crisis will begin. The destiny facing the people of Darfur will be death from hunger or disease.","word.count":186,"sep11":1.86797752808989,"years":2003.72752808989,"days":3107,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.00746830136864603,"Topic 2":0.0101928698024255,"Topic 3":0.0335618359431529,"Topic 4":0.00428994190306628,"Topic 5":0.0256274214392325,"Topic 6":0.00595133424903473,"Topic 7":0.200829443324643,"Topic 8":0.0578523867388405,"Topic 9":0.651180109802823,"Topic 10":0.0030463554281352},{"id":"10419950129784","body":"Kit Bond: I thank the Senator for his comments and request.

I'd like to point out a few things about MAP, which used to go by the acronym MPP. Over the past several years, Congress has mandated several reforms. These changes help small businesses and co-ops, limit branded promotion activities and increase the cost share requirements for private firms. On top of that the authorized level of spending was cut $20 million in the 1996 farm bill. But step back and look at the larger picture. The farm bill that was signed into law a little more than 2 months ago made sweeping changes in agriculture policy. An integral part of those reforms was increasing the focus on exports. American farmers are competing for market share in countries around the world. They are competing against farmers in countries that provide far, far deeper subsidies. In my home State of Maine, potato farmers are suffering at the hands of subsidized Canadian imports. One bright spot is the potential for overseas outlets for Maine potatoes. The industry is exploring options. They need assistance in gaining access to those markets. I recently talked to a friend of mine, Rodney McCrum who farms 650 acres of potatoes in Aroostook County, ME. I asked him about MAP. He said, and I quote, ``That program really expands the world market to create jobs here in Maine. We just get so much bang for our buck.'' In the past decade the value of U.S. potato exports has increased nearly six-fold, reaching more than half a billion dollars that has come about in large part as the result of the pooling of industry money and funds from the old MPP program. We need to build on that success. We need to continue to ensure that U.S. agriculture continues to be competitive overseas, that our agriculture exports continue to exceed our imports, that our farmers remain the best in the world. I urge you to oppose the amendment.","word.count":231,"sep11":-6.62078651685393,"years":1995.23876404494,"days":85,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.732180393720851,"Topic 2":0.0569162905945053,"Topic 3":0.0906106151610394,"Topic 4":0.0472048718530173,"Topic 5":0.0135900271867173,"Topic 6":0.0118499176316456,"Topic 7":0.006786971895141,"Topic 8":0.0215508786811009,"Topic 9":0.0105742545596844,"Topic 10":0.00873577871629748},{"id":"10820040004173","body":"Michael Burgess: I thank the gentleman from New Mexico. We heard earlier this evening the gentleman from Michigan stand up and talk about paying for health care. Mr. Speaker, an op-ed piece by Ronald Brownstein out in Los Angeles, California in December talked about that he thought there were only two ways to pay for health care in this country: One was an employer-given indemnity insurance plan and the other is a government-paid system. As a longtime participant in the health care field, there is a certain segment of health care that is delivered free of charge. It is uncompensated because someone either cannot pay or will not pay, and the bill therefore is uncompensated and the hospital or physician or provider simply eats that charge, and that goes on every day of the week. But there is a fourth source and that is, of course, the individual who is going to write a check themselves, going to pay for their care themselves out of pocket. One of the problems in the world nowadays is that medical care has become so expensive so many people find that daunting, but that is why the health savings accounts not just for seniors but started at an early age and really making them available to all Americans, that is why that is such a crucial part of the overall reform encompassed within the Medicare bill. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Michigan also referenced the newspaper Roll Call. We are all familiar with Roll Call up here on the Hill. Certainly the writers in Roll Call are no particular friend of the President of the United States. In fact, sometimes they are quite critical of him. On one of those occasions where the gentleman that writes the column Pennsylvania Avenue was very critical of the President was right after the State of the Union address, I believe it was the Monday following the President's State of the Union address, where in this House he addressed both Houses of Congress and said that he appreciated what we had done with health savings accounts, he wanted now to extend that, he wanted there to be full deductibility for a so- called catastrophic medical insurance policy, that a person would be able to deduct the cost of that from their income taxes. Mr. Speaker, combining the power of the HSA with full deductibility of catastrophic coverage pretty much removes from consideration, that is, anyone who pays insurance in this country would no longer have an excuse for not having health insurance. We would have given them every reason to spend those tax-deferred dollars on the insurance coverage that they need. One of the other programs that the President talked about that night, and I think the gentleman from Michigan also referenced this, was association health plans. Association health plans are a critical tool that allows small businesses of a similar business model to band together across State lines if necessary and get the purchasing power of a larger corporation, an idea that has a lot of common sense to it. An organization such as a collection of chambers of commerce, for example, or a collection of realtors, for example, these would be businesses of a similar business model, they could group together; a group of realtors could go in together and get more purchasing power with the money they use to buy health insurance policies and extend coverage and keep people from dropping out of providing insurance coverage to their employees, one of the problems that the gentleman from Michigan referenced. Association health plans were again passed in this House in June of last year and again that is an example of some legislation that sort of stalled on the other side of the Capitol Building. I hope that it will get taken up at some point. There is another measure, Mr. Speaker. The gentlewoman from Texas , my next door neighbor in Fort Worth, has a bill to provide tax credits for the uninsured. You may say, gosh, that is great. Somebody who pays income taxes can now afford health insurance. But what about someone who does not make enough money to pay income taxes? What are they going to do for insurance? This would be a pre- fundable tax credit, available to someone at the beginning of the year to use for the purchase of a health insurance policy. Mr. Speaker, the combination of these three things, the health savings accounts with the inclusion of the catastrophic policy, with full deductibility of a catastrophic policy, association health plans and tax credits for the uninsured, comprise a fairly significant number of the uninsured who can be taken off the rolls of the uninsured. Mr. Kondracke was kind of critical of the President after those three proposals were sort of wrapped together in the State of the Union address. Mr. Kondracke said, gosh, that will only cover a quarter of the people who are uninsured in this country. Mr. Speaker, that is 10 million people, in excess of 10 million people. I submit if we have the power in our hands, without any heavy lifting, to provide coverage to 10 million uninsured by the end of this year without increasing the deficit, for heaven's sake that is something we should do. There should be a moral imperative for us to take up and pass that legislation. I urge other Members of this body to look favorably on tax credits for the uninsured when that legislation comes forward. I would encourage the Committee on Ways and Means to let that be reported out of committee and come to this House for a vote. Again, good legislation that has stalled at the other end of the Capitol needs to see the light of day. With that, Mr. Speaker, again my condolences to the people in Spain. I want to finish up tonight by yielding back the remainder of the time to the gentleman from New Mexico and thank him for his participation in this hour of debate this evening.","word.count":1008,"sep11":2.57584269662921,"years":2004.43539325843,"days":3359,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0258484115246557,"Topic 2":0.409857404696041,"Topic 3":0.0687495672951791,"Topic 4":0.0149086506177763,"Topic 5":0.318234956463728,"Topic 6":0.0116426887702973,"Topic 7":0.00596519909656511,"Topic 8":0.0805152917737034,"Topic 9":0.0570985208210952,"Topic 10":0.00717930894095898},{"id":"10720010065461","body":"Paul Sarbanes: Mr. President, last night the Senate passed, by unanimous consent, the Hatch-Leahy PROTECT Act providing important new tools to fight child pornography. I want to take a moment to speak about the passage of this important bill and the effort that it took to get to this point. Although they have recessed subject to the recall of the Speaker of the House, I also want to implore the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives not to miss this important opportunity to pass such important bipartisan legislation as this. In April, I came to the Senate floor and joined Senator Hatch in introducing S. 2520, the PROTECT Act, after the Supreme Court's decision in Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition . Although there were some others who raised constitutional concerns about specific provisions in that bill, I believed--and still believe-- that unlike the Administration proposal, it was a good faith effort to work within the First Amendment. Everyone in the Senate agrees that we should do all we can to protect our children from being victimized by child pornography. That would be an easy debate and vote. The more difficult thing is to write a law that will both do that and will stick. In 1996, when we passed the Child Pornography Prevention Act, ``CPPA'', many warned us that certain provisions of that Act violated the First Amendment. The Supreme Court's recent decision in Free Speech has proven them correct. We should not sit by and do nothing. It is important that we respond to the Supreme Court decision. It is just as important, however, that we avoid repeating our past mistakes. Unlike the 1996 CPPA, this time we should respond with a law that passes constitutional muster. Our children deserve more than a press conference on this issue. They deserve a law that will last. It is important that we do all we can to end the victimization of real children by child pornographers, but it is also important that we pass a law that will withstand First Amendment scrutiny. We need a law with real teeth, not one with false teeth. After joining Senator Hatch in introducing the PROTECT Act, I convened a Judiciary Committee hearing on the legislation. We heard from the Administration, from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, NCMEC, and from experts who came and told us that our bill, as introduced, would pass constitutional muster, but the House-passed bill would not. I then placed S. 2520 on the Judiciary Committee's calendar for the October 8, 2002, business meeting. I continued to work with Senator Hatch to improve the bill so that it could be quickly enacted. Senator Hatch circulated a Hatch-Leahy proposed Judiciary Committee substitute that improved the bill before our October 8 business meeting. Unfortunately the Judiciary Committee was unable to consider it because of procedural maneuvering by my colleagues that had nothing to do with this important legislation, including the refusal of Committee members on the other side of the aisle to consider any pending legislation on the Committee's agenda. I still wanted to get this bill done. That is why, for a full week in October, I worked to clear and have the full Senate pass a substitute to S. 2520 that tracked the Hatch-Leahy proposed committee substitute in nearly every area. Indeed, the substitute I offered even adopted parts of the House bill which would help the NCMEC work with local and state law enforcement on these cases. Twice, I spoke on the Senate floor imploring that we approve such legislation. As I stated then, every single Democratic Senator cleared that measure. I then urged Republicans to work on their side of the aisle to clear this measure-- so similar to the joint Hatch-Leahy substitute--so that we could swiftly enact a law that would pass constitutional muster. Unfortunately, instead of working to clear that bipartisan, constitutional measure, colleagues on the other side of the aisle opted to use this issue to play politics before the election. They redrafted the bill, changed crucial definitions, and offered a new version. Facing the recess before the mid-term elections, we were stymied again. Even after the election, however, during our lame duck session, I have continued to work with Senator Hatch to pass this legislation through the Senate. As I had stated I would do prior to the election, I called a meeting of the Judiciary Committee yesterday. In the last meeting of the Judiciary Committee under my Chairmanship in the 107th Congress, I placed S. 2520, the Hatch-Leahy PROTECT Act, on the agenda again. At that meeting the Judiciary Committee approved this legislation, as amended. We agreed on a substitute and to improvements in the victim shield provision that I authored. Although I did not agree with two of Senator Hatch's amendments because I thought that they risked having the bill declared unconstitutional, I nevertheless both called for the Committee to approve the bill and voted for the bill in its amended form. I then sought, that same day, to gain the unanimous consent of the full Senate to pass S. 2520 as reported by the Judiciary Committee, and I worked with Senator Hatch to clear the bill on both sides of the aisle. I am please that late last night that the Senate passed S. 2520 by unanimous consent. I want to thank Senator Hatch for his help clearing the bill for passage last night. I am glad to have been able to work hand in hand with Senator Hatch on S. 2520, the PROTECT Act, a bill that gives prosecutors and investigators the tools they need to combat child pornography. The Hatch-Leahy PROTECT Act strives to be a serious response to a serious problem. The provisions of the Hatch-Leahy bill, S. 2520, as we introduced it are bipartisan and good faith efforts to protect both our children and to honor the Constitution. At our hearing last month, Constitutional and criminal law scholars--one of whom was the same person who warned us last time that the CPPA would be struck down--stated that the PROTECT Act could withstand Constitutional scrutiny, although there were parts that were very close to the line. Unfortunately these experts could not say the same about the administration's bill, which seems to challenge the Supreme Court's decision, rather than accommodate the restraints spelled out by the Supreme Court. I have also received letters from other Constitutional scholars and practitioners expressing the same conclusion, which I will place in the Record with unanimous consent. The Administration's proposal and House bill simply ignore the Supreme Court's decision and reflect an ideological response instead of a carefully drawn bill that will stand up to scrutiny. The PROTECT Act is a good faith effort, but it is not perfect and I would have liked to have seen some additional changes to the bill. Unfortunately, I could not obtain agreement to make the following modifications: First, regarding the tip line, I would have liked to clarify that law enforcement agents cannot ``tickle the tip line'' to avoid the key protections of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act. Second, regarding the affirmative defense, I would have liked to ensure that there is an affirmative defense for the new category of child pornography and for all cases where a defendant can prove in court that a specific, non-obscene image was made using not any child but only actual, identifiable adults. Nevertheless, we were able to reach agreement in Committee on modifying the bill with my amendment to the victims' shield law by giving federal judges and prosecutors the discretion to override the new victim shield law when there is good cause, such as cases where the shield law is actually used as a sword by the defendant to help assert a defense. As a general matter, I would have thought it far simpler to take the approach of outlawing ``obscene'' child pornography of all types, which we do in one new provision that I suggested. That approach would produce a law beyond any possible challenge. This approach is also supported by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which we all respect as the true expert in this field. Following is an excerpt from the Center's answer to written questions submitted after our hearing, which I will place in the Record in its entirety: Thus, according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the approach that is least likely to raise constitutional questions--using established obscenity law--is also an effective one. Because that is not the approach we decided to use, I recognize that S. 2520 contains provisions about which some may have legitimate Constitutional questions. These provisions include: A new ``pandering'' provision with a very wide scope; a new definition of `obscenity' that contains some, but not all, of the elements of the Supreme Court's test; a new affirmative defense for pornography made not using any minors that does not apply to one new category of child pornography. These provisions raise legitimate concerns, but in the interest of making progress I am pleased, as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, to have tried to balance all the competing interests to produce a bill with the best chance of withstanding a constitutional challenge. That is not everyone's view. Others evidently think it is more important to make an ideological statement than to write a law. A media report just this week on this legislation noted the wide consensus that S. 2520 is more likely than the House bill to withstand scrutiny, but quoted a Republican House member as stating: ``Even if it comes back to Congress three times we will have created better legislation.'' To me, that makes no sense. Why not create the ``better legislation'' right now for today's children, instead of inviting more years of litigation and putting at risk any convictions obtained in the interim period before the Supreme Court again reviews the constitutionality of Congress' effort to address this serious problem?

In the midst of all our sadness I think the one thing that keeps occurring over and over and over again is wonderful, uplifting, fun stories and memories of Stephanie Tubbs Jones. In fact, I was privileged to share a whole sequence of fun, funny, uplifting experiences with Stephanie Tubbs Jones, and I concur with my colleague, Emanuel Cleaver, who made a comment earlier that this life did not cheat our friend Stephanie Tubbs Jones. She lived and enjoyed every single minute of it. Even when she was working, she was having fun. So I suspect you're going to hear from this group that is coming for this Special Order more stories about our experiences with her because they were all a series of fun experiences. Let me start with this experience. Probably 3 weeks before Stephanie Tubbs Jones' death, 7:30 a.m. in the morning the phone rings at my residence in Charlotte, North Carolina, and on the other end is Stephanie Tubbs Jones saying, Mel, I got into your city last night at about 10 o'clock in the morning. I was on my way from Memphis, Tennessee, where I had been campaigning for a person who was running for Congress, and I was on my way to give a speech in Cincinnati, Ohio, and there was bad weather in Cincinnati, Ohio, and I ended up spending the night at a motel in Charlotte, North Carolina, and I don't have any clothes and I am supposed to be giving a speech in Cincinnati later today. What can you do for me? I said, Well, Stephanie, no problem. I will just have somebody pick you up, take you to the shopping center. You can do your shopping, buy a whole new wardrobe. So she went to all this excuse to go shopping. We will hook you up. So that very morning, as soon as the stores opened in Charlotte, one of my staff members had Stephanie Tubbs Jones at the mall and she did her shopping and we got her to the airport by 11:30 that morning to catch her flight to Cincinnati. She went to Cincinnati and gave her speech. Now I missed the opportunity to see the outfits--not one, but outfits--that Stephanie Tubbs Jones purchased that morning. She promised me she was going to show me the special outfit that she purchased, and I never got the opportunity to see it. But as those kinds of stories that make Stephanie Tubbs Jones a real person to us, not just a colleague in Congress, but a friend, a peer, a confidante, a person that you knew that if she ever made a commitment to you, would be there come heck or high water. I am cleaning it up a little bit. She was our friend, a delightful, wonderful person, always with a smile. She never got cheated in this life, because she lived every moment of it. I thank my colleague for yielding me time. I know there are so many other of my colleagues here to pay tribute. I could go on and on and on, but I won't. I thank you for doing this. My condolences to Barbara and Mervyn and the entire Stephanie Tubbs Jones family.","word.count":626,"sep11":5.93820224719101,"years":2007.79775280899,"days":4556,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0238898962204479,"Topic 2":0.108636996044383,"Topic 3":0.00616356883262395,"Topic 4":0.341705055430459,"Topic 5":0.0187407799865052,"Topic 6":0.00722453225338836,"Topic 7":0.0236876511225969,"Topic 8":0.0113574498672408,"Topic 9":0.454328956719662,"Topic 10":0.00426511352269295},{"id":"10920060052983","body":"Gordon Smith: Mr. President, since the conflict in Afghanistan and Iraq, 2,808 American men and women have paid the ultimate sacrifice. Of that number, 63 are Oregonians, or those who have Oregon ties. There are 63 patriots among that total. I rise today to honor them, but I also feel compelled to come here this afternoon to pay particular honor to Tom Tucker who recently lost his life and to do what I can through my words to assuage in some possible way, if possible, the grief of his parents, Wes and Meg Tucker of Madras, OR. Army PVT Thomas Tucker was born in Pineville, OR, in central Oregon, in the beautiful rimrock country of that part of our State. He grew up in Madras and graduated from Madras High School in 1999. He worked in a variety of jobs before feeling the call to serve his country and enlisted in the U.S. Army in July of 2005. He was attached to the First Battalion of the 502nd Infantry Regiment of the Second Brigade, 101st Airborne Division. He has been in Iraq since February of 2006. When word came through that he had been taken hostage by al-Qaida fighters in Iraq, I called his father Wes. I wasn't very far into the conversation when it was clear to me that I was talking to a dad who was also a patriot, was proud of his son and fearful for the consequences that may befall him. The worst-of-all news came out when the whole country, and particularly my State, learned not only that Thomas had given his life but that he had been tortured, that his body had been defiled and had been booby-trapped to take the lives of other American soldiers. I have no words sufficient to tell the Tucker family how truly sorry I am for the extent of their loss. Yet I stand in awe and amazement that this morning on the NBC ``Today'' program there came Wes Tucker's face. And he said: ``Our son, as far as we are concerned, has died for the freedom of everyone in the United States.'' I could not agree with him more. Wes and Meg Tucker are made of sterner stuff. They did not blame the President. They did not blame the military. They simply acknowledged that their son was in the service of his country knowing the risk and willing to sacrifice it all. I salute them, and I will never forget them or their son. I am told by news accounts that Madras, OR, a town of 6,000 people, has now become a family of 6,000 people, gathering around the Tucker family, to offer whatever consolation they can and the support that is required, to let the Tucker family know that their son is an American hero now and forever. Many wonder, what did Tom die for? I believe, as his father said, that he died for his country, that he died for freedom's sake, and the cause of freedom is one that comes with a very high price. It has hit home hard in Oregon today. Al-Qaida is a serpent with many heads. It found Tom, and in finding him revealed the ugliness, the barbarity, the brutality of the enemy that we face. Understand, al-Qaida's words in this war, their purposes, their intentions, their objectives are to create--these are not George Bush's words, these are their words--a new califate in the Middle East such as existed for several centuries, ranging from Spain as far as Pakistan, to establish sharia law. If you want to know what sharia law is, look at the governments of the Taliban and the brutality that attended their government. It is for the extermination of the state of Israel, and it is for the holding hostage of western civilization. I believe Tom Tucker died in opposition to these hideous aims of our enemies on Earth today. Anyone who believes that America does not have a stake in this is deeply mistaking themselves. During my first term in the U.S. Senate I served on the Foreign Relations Committee. I wasn't on that committee long until I was simply amazed and overwhelmed in terms of my schedule by the number of foreign leaders who sought out an audience in my office seeking trade, aid, and military alliance with the United States. I used to wonder, why do they come to us? Why must we solve their problems? It was evident because they knew America had values for which it was willing to pay a high price. So I have to ask, why us? And history's answer is, why not us? In the 20th century, the United States of America and a number of our stalwart friends--the British come quickly to mind--have filled the void to stop tyranny when our defense, first, our interests, our values and our allies required our help. It is no different now in 21st century. We all want our kids to come home. I pray for that daily. And I am thankful that their numbers are declining and that they are coming home. What this debate is about and the difference we share with our friends on the other side of the aisle is simply the wisdom of announcing a date for withdrawal. As I have studied history, I have never found an instance whereby victory is won by announcing retreat. Wisdom counsels, I believe, that we hold our cards closer to our vest. Al-Qaida is counting on us to go home just as they cite in their Web sites our retreat from Beirut, our inaction in the face of innumerable, outrageous terrorist attacks during the 1990s--and they took it all for weakness. I want our kids to come home. But I want us to see the ugly face of al-Qaida and understand the deadliness and earnestness of their purposes and how antithetical they are to the future of this Nation and to the future of our children and to the civilization that we enjoy in such abundance in this blessed land. Al-Qaida is counting on us to set a date. It is for that reason that I will vote against any amendment that sets a date. I want to express to my colleagues on the other side that the rhetoric is too heated. When I hear things like ``Bush lied, kids died,'' or even on our side, ``retreat''--and whatever the mantra is-- my soul cries out for something more dignified. I don't believe their dissent is unpatriotic. I simply believe it to be unwise. It is a tactical mistake of monumental proportions. I do not know how long the war on terror will go. But I do know that we have an interest in it. We learned that interest on 9/11. We learn that interest with the death of every soldier. I yield the floor with a plea that we keep our tactics to ourselves and that we understand that America will not be defeated but that we can defeat ourselves. I urge opposition to the Levin amendment. I yield the floor.","word.count":1179,"sep11":4.89887640449438,"years":2006.75842696629,"days":4186,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.59094861115408,"Topic 2":0.286663362839773,"Topic 3":0.00725522826795522,"Topic 4":0.0152863190759818,"Topic 5":0.0208764269043432,"Topic 6":0.00630994131085745,"Topic 7":0.0266181006002073,"Topic 8":0.0268689633793356,"Topic 9":0.013568005197867,"Topic 10":0.00560504126959963},{"id":"10720010044401","body":"Bob Torricelli: I ask unanimous consent the concurrent resolution be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, without any intervening action or debate.","word.count":2098,"sep11":-0.466292134831461,"years":2001.39325842697,"days":2276,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.033484585932445,"Topic 2":0.202067709024752,"Topic 3":0.0155037668052699,"Topic 4":0.0108674558075121,"Topic 5":0.585003327387533,"Topic 6":0.00636277660434092,"Topic 7":0.047735840488718,"Topic 8":0.023624772600044,"Topic 9":0.0650726321023375,"Topic 10":0.0102771332470481},{"id":"10419960007022","body":"Robert K.

So under this plan, if States save money by shifting drug costs from Medicaid to Medicare, States have to give a portion of those savings that they get back to the Federal Government every year. Many States, such as Washington, have stepped up to the plate and have tried to fill the gap in Medicare by providing affordable, comprehensive prescription drug coverage through Medicaid for people who are eligible for both programs. Over the past 10 years, as drug costs have rapidly increased, this burden has become overwhelming. Many States are now being forced to scale back their coverage in access. In 2002, Washington State spent an estimated $212.8 million on drug costs for people who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. That was a huge strain on my State. Under this plan we are considering, the States will see some relief by shifting Medicaid beneficiaries to Medicare for drug coverage. But, unfortunately, the plan gives with one hand and takes back with the other. Washington State, under this plan, will be forced to surrender much of the savings it sees back to the Federal Government. That could reduce Washington State's Federal Medicaid dollars by almost $2 billion from 2006 to 2013. That could devastate the entire program and result in further Medicaid reductions for low-income children and families. It could force the State to again implement reductions in provider payments for doctors, hospitals, and nursing homes. A $2 billion give-back, just for my State, will mean more uninsured, lower provider payments, and more children losing any health care safety net they have today. Let's not forget that States will be handed a massive new administration burden under this plan. Washington State will now have to administer new asset tests to determine who qualifies under Medicare for low-income assistance. These tests are extremely restrictive and will result in many low-income seniors being pushed into higher income categories. Under the conference agreement, assets will be limited to $6,000 for a single person and $9,000 for a married couple. In order to get any additional financial assistance under this plan, many seniors and the disabled will be forced to impoverish themselves and give up almost everything they have worked so hard to earn. Even if the States want to provide a more humane benefit or assistance, they will not be allowed to do so. Now, many of us fought to provide relief to States just this year by temporarily increasing the Federal Medicaid match. This was a critically important fight to save Medicaid and prevent massive Medicaid cuts on doctors and hospitals. Our success in achieving a small measure of relief is now being undone by imposing an even greater burden on the States. Finally, Mr. President, this bill will punish Washington State even further in Medicare payments. For several years, I have been working to address the geographic disparities that punish providers and seniors in my State of Washington. For years, Washington State has received unfair treatment. Today, Washington State ranks 41st in the Nation in Medicare payments per beneficiary. We are being penalized because we have a tradition of low-cost, efficient health care, and healthy seniors. Medicare should reward that. Instead, its outdated reimbursement formulas are causing doctors to leave my State or close their practices to new Medicare patients. I have spoken at great length on the Senate floor before about this, and I have introduced legislation to correct that inequity. But under this bill, the situation would be even worse. Washington State would fall from 41st in the Nation to 45th in the Nation. Even though there will be a slight increase in payments to Washington, because of what happens to other States, we end up falling even further behind. This is a fundamental shift in the Medicare entitlement, in exchange for a very weak benefit. Philosophically, this plan goes in the wrong direction. We should be strengthening the foundation of Medicare, not experimenting with imposing a new health care system on seniors. This plan undermines the role of the Federal Government in ensuring that every senior can live with the dignity and respect and stability they deserve. It could force seniors into an overly restrictive, ever- changing health system. Let's not forget why Medicare was enacted in the first place. It was created because the private insurance market failed seniors and the disabled. Coverage was sporadic, expensive, and unpredictable. Medicare, when it was enacted, changed all of that for our Nation's seniors. Now I am afraid we are flirting with that original failed model. I believe we can do better. During my time in the Senate, I have been proud to work on prescription drug coverage--from helping to draft the MEND Act in the 106th Congress to working on the Budget Committee over the past 4 years to fund prescription drugs. I was proud to support the Graham-Miller-Kennedy bill in the 107th Congress that would have provided an affordable, reliable, comprehensive prescription drug benefit as part of Medicare. We had a chance to do much better. I believe a prescription drug benefit ought to be a seamless part of Medicare. It should be treated just like a doctor's office visit or an outpatient surgical procedure. By implementing a seamless, affordable benefit as part of Medicare, as we did when we added the Part B benefit, we would guarantee that all seniors have access to the same level of care, regardless of their health status or their age or their income or their assets or where they live. That access would be stable, and it would be predictable. I know we can do this. Many of us in this Chamber, on both sides of the aisle, have worked to significantly boost our investment in NIH funding. We have fought to reform and modernize the FDA to ensure timely approval of new, lifesaving drugs. I want all of my seniors and disabled constituents to benefit from those kinds of investments. Under the plan before us today, I cannot be sure they will reap the rewards of this Federal investment.","word.count":1053,"sep11":2.25561797752809,"years":2004.11516853933,"days":3245,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0850693559166678,"Topic 2":0.104529482391405,"Topic 3":0.0512630155451514,"Topic 4":0.272728526281756,"Topic 5":0.0138554582289421,"Topic 6":0.00286665322888775,"Topic 7":0.00336264514167463,"Topic 8":0.0942408830236909,"Topic 9":0.013608551931724,"Topic 10":0.3584754283101},{"id":"10720010027575","body":"Ken Calvert: Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me say I rise to support this rule and previously rose by way of my vote to support the defense appropriations and the rule. I thank the Chair Mr. Hobson and ranking member Mr. Olver for their good work. However, it is interesting that we would discuss this particular rule in the shadow of our recent vote dealing with the question of the decision of whether or not this Nation should go to war. I do believe that it is important for those of us who support our United States military to ensure better housing conditions and better pay and improve their quality of life issues, should make it very clear--we are concerned about a strong military. Just recently, I was able to travel to Guantanamo Bay. I have seen the work that we do to enhance the living conditions of our troops, and I do want to thank the committee whose responsibility it is to do that. Likewise, having recently returned from Afghanistan, I saw the frontline troops doing their job. That is why I think it is very important that, as we leave this body, that we realize that those of us who had a differing opinion on the question of going to war realize the sacred responsibility that we had and realize that, as the President is the Commander-in-Chief, that we who might have opposition stand with the people of the United States to ensure our security, but, at the same time, reflect upon the importance of the Constitution that says only Congress can declare war. We stand ready to fight terrorism, but I think it is very important for the American people to be wise and aware that we can find a way to resolve these matters with our frontline troops being strong and ready by continuing diplomacy first and working with the United Nations Security Council and not giving the authority of first strike to the Commander-in-Chief without the authorization under the Constitution that we have to declare war. This is an important admonition. It is not stepping away from our responsibilities. It is not fear, for I look fear in the eye, and I will stand against it. It is not a fear of fighting terrorism, for I look terrorism in the eye and will fight against it. But it is a recognition of my sacred duty and responsibility to declare my standing with saving the lives of young men and women who offer themselves to fight for our freedom and justice in the United States military. We will go off to our respective districts and each of us will have cast a vote of conscience. I believe that each of us should be respected as patriots and Americans, realizing that we have made a decision on the facts at hand. But it cannot be denied that the Constitution was written by our Founding Fathers for us not to be silent. It was written to be the underpinnings of democracy. So that as we look to give guidance to this Nation, we can be thankful for those who serve us in the United States military, but, as well, Mr. Speaker, as I close, we can say thank you, but, as well, we can stand for saving the lives of the young men and women in the military because it is a question of life and death--that's why it is our duty as Members of Congress to make decisions of war on fact and constitutional grounds.","word.count":237,"sep11":0.117977528089888,"years":2001.97752808989,"days":2484,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.144258632503129,"Topic 2":0.212493287067137,"Topic 3":0.0062952033574615,"Topic 4":0.00648853577257194,"Topic 5":0.01741123820266,"Topic 6":0.0197069392755808,"Topic 7":0.55079948983571,"Topic 8":0.00959887375044525,"Topic 9":0.0305684302730952,"Topic 10":0.00237936996221035},{"id":"10620000001504","body":"Greg Ganske: Mr. Speaker, as an Iowa Republican Congressman who is Catholic and has been supported by Christian conservatives as well as moderates, I feel compelled to comment on the Bob Jones University and the House Chaplain controversies. Mr. Speaker, I went to Catholic grade school in the 1950s and early 1960s. I remember what a big deal it was when JFK was elected President. In those days, there were still discriminations against Catholics and terrible stories told about my faith. To be fair, Mr. Speaker, Catholics were not always tolerant, either. My mother came from an Irish-Catholic Democrat family. Older Catholics today still have vivid memories of anti-Catholicism. Our country's anti-Catholicism history goes way back before the virulent ``Know-Nothings'' just before the Civil War. In the early days of my party, the GOP did not do much to reassure Catholics that the Republican Party was a place where they could be comfortable. But times change. Along came the Ecumenical Council, Christians of all creeds became more tolerant, and now even Garrison Keillor can make jokes about the foibles of Catholics and Lutherans in Lake Wobegone. I certainly believe that my Lutheran mother-in-law and father-in-law have every bit as good a chance to go to heaven as my Catholic relatives do, maybe better in light of all their good works, but do not let us get into good works versus faith. So when Governor Bush spoke at Bob Jones University and its anti- Catholicism was publicized, Catholics were reminded of past discrimination and were really disappointed that he did not immediately label these views bigoted in no uncertain terms when he found out about those views. Bob Jones University President is Bob Jones, III, and this is how he describes the one billion-member Roman Catholic Church: ``A cult which calls itself Christian.'' This is on the official Bob Jones University Web site: ``The Roman church is not another Christian denomination. It is a satanic counterfeit, an ecclesiastic tyranny over the souls of men, not to bring them to salvation, but to hold them bound in sin and hurl them into eternal damnation. It is the old harlot in the Book of Revelation, the mother of harlots.'' Calling Pope John Paul the ``antichrist,'' saying that the Eucharist is ``cannibalism,'' calling my church a ``harlot,'' is deeply hurtful and mean and insulting. I must say I find Bob Jones' racism equally offensive. Governor Bush has been rightly criticized for not calling a bigot a bigot. In the spirit of bipartisanship critique, I hasten to add that Al Gore and Bill Bradley should be roundly criticized for not condemning Al Sharpton for his anti-Jewish bigotry as well. All this brings us to the current ``holy war'' in this House of the people over the replacement of the House chaplain. Reverend Ford, the well-liked Lutheran current House chaplain, is retiring.

I want to thank Senators Kennedy and Gregg, Congressmen Boehner and Miller and their staffs for their hard work in crafting a bipartisan piece of legislation that will give children the opportunity to succeed in the classroom. I am also happy to see that this legislation includes an emphasis on math and science education. Senator Frist, Congressman Ehlers and myself have worked hard to make ensure that there is a renewed focus on a portion of education curricula that needs addressing. Scores on the National Assessment for Educational Progress, NAEP, test in the subject area of science have not improved over the last several years and, in fact, have been lower than previous years test scores. Seniors in high school who took the 2000 NAEP science test scored, on average, three points lower than those taking the test in 1996. Only 18 percent correctly answered challenging science questions, down from 21 percent and those students who knew just the basics dropped to 53 percent. This is simply unacceptable. According to an Associated Press article that appeared in the Kansas City Star on November 20, many science teachers complain that they can't persuade school officials to give them the time or money required for training. Our math and science provision in this bill addresses this very problem through a variety of ways, including: one, improving and upgrading the status and stature of mathematics and science teaching by encouraging institutions of higher education to assume greater responsibility for improving mathematics and science teacher education; two, create career-long opportunities for ongoing professional development for math and science teachers; three, provide mentoring opportunities for teachers by bringing them together with engineers, scientists and mathematicians; and four, develop more rigorous math and science curricula. This legislation authorizes the math and science partnerships at $450 million in the first year. I would encourage my colleagues, especially in light of the recent NAEP scores, to adequately fund this program in order to improve the abilities of our teachers to provide good, quality instruction in math and science. We are in an age where science and technology fields are booming and yet we cannot produce students who even have an understanding of basic science principles. How can we attract students into fields that are experiencing dramatic shortages such as nursing or engineering when they don't have a good background in math and science? We have failed our children and I believe it is imperative to the future of our country to make sure that our children are adequately prepared in math and science subject areas. I am disappointed that we did not have the opportunity to provide our school districts the financial relief needed in the area of special education. I have strongly supported funding the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA, at the full 40 percent and yet we will go another year with it being inadequately funded by the Federal Government. We have made dramatic improvements in the funding levels over the last several years. However, we are now only providing approximately 15 percent instead of the 40 that we said we would commit 26 years ago. I look forward to working with my colleagues who have stated throughout the conference their willingness to address this issue next year when IDEA will be reauthorized. I am pleased with our overall product and will be looking forward to seeing results in the years to come as our States and local districts work to implement the reforms made in this bill. I believe the State of Kansas overall provides a good education for it's children and I look forward to seeing the quality of education in Kansas get even better.","word.count":644,"sep11":0.275280898876405,"years":2002.13483146067,"days":2540,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.746514949327888,"Topic 2":0.0844070894213396,"Topic 3":0.0183637780457605,"Topic 4":0.0390154274246368,"Topic 5":0.0187238754093806,"Topic 6":0.0175150798849644,"Topic 7":0.0146157205104219,"Topic 8":0.0319025652509988,"Topic 9":0.0203689196321107,"Topic 10":0.00857259509249873},{"id":"10920060031736","body":"John Larson: Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleagues for coming to the floor this morning, and certainly those of us listening today and throughout this country can understand that our frustration here is only superseded by the frustration of millions of Americans.

We assure you that nothing in this bill affects monetary policy of the Federal Reserve. Back in September 1993, Senator Dorgan and I requested a GAO investigation of the operations and management of the Federal Reserve System. We were concerned because no close examination of the Fed's operations had ever been conducted before. The GAO report that was issued in 1996 raised serious questions about management within the Fed which this bill will address. One of the most astonishing findings in the 1996 report was the Fed had squirreled-away $3.7 billion in taxpayer money in a slush fund. As of January 1998, this amount has now grown to $5.2 billion. This money could be used for deficit reduction. The Fed claims the slush fund is needed to cover system losses. Since it was created in 1913, however, the Fed has never operated at a loss. This bill prohibits maintenance of surplus accounts and the surplus funds must be sent to Treasury. The bill requires the Comptroller General of U.S. and the Fed Board of Governors to identify the functions and activities of the Board and each Fed bank which relate to U.S. monetary policy. After six months after enactment, all non-monetary policy expenses of Federal Reserve System, will be subject to congressional appropriations. The Fed will now have to justify its use of operating expenses. Because of the Fed's self-financing nature, its operating costs have escaped public investigation. In order to be fiscally responsible, all activities regarding government finances need to be scrutinized. Surprisingly, the GAO study was the very first look into the internal operations of the Fed. We think that oversight is needed on the workings of this large and influential public entity. While the rest of Federal government has tightened its belt and down-sized, the Fed enjoyed enormous growth in its operating costs and questionable growth in its staffing. Clearly, the Fed could do much more to increase its fiscal responsibility, particularly as it urges frugal practices for other agencies. The picture the GAO report painted of the internal management of the Fed is one of conflicting policies, questionable spending, erratic personnel treatment, and favoritism in procurement and contracting policies. To date, there has never been an annual, independent audit of the nation's central banking system. This bill provides for annual independent audits of the banks, the Board of Governors and the Federal Reserve System. The detection of any possible illegal acts must be reported to the Comptroller General. The bill requires an annual audit of each Federal reserve bank, the Federal reserve board of governors and in turn, an audit of the Federal reserve system. This Auditor must be a certified public accountant who is totally independent of the Fed. An annual audit is fiscally sound policy which would instill greater public confidence in our banking system. This bill would also would reform the pricing practices of Federal Reserve System so that fair competition with private businesses would exist. It will eliminate the possibility of accusations of favoritism and conflict of interest in procurement and contracting. This examination will ensure that the Federal Reserve is competing fairly with its private-sector competitors. This matter of fairness becomes very important when the agency both competes with the private sector and also regulates their competitors. The Federal Reserve operates several lines of business, which compete with the private sector. These businesses are referred to as ``priced services.'' This legislation will ensure that the Federal Reserve is accountable for the manner in which these businesses are run and how the prices for these services are calculated. The Federal Reserve is required by the Monetary Control Act of 1980 to match its revenues with its costs so that the prices for services it sells are not subsidized. We want to make sure that no accounting or pricing policy hides any subsidy. This legislation will benefit anyone who cashes a check in this country because it promotes a fair and competitive market place for those who provide the many services necessary to process the collection of checks. Costs should be fully recovered in the Federal Reserve's pricing. These annual audits will ensure that they are recovered and will level the playing field for those who can offer competitive services We usually think of the Federal Reserve in the terms of monetary policy, of setting interest rates. I want to make it very clear, I'm not attempting to interfere with, or impugn, the monetary policy of the Fed. I am simply seeking greater accountability in the operating expenses and internal management of one of our most influential institutions. I believe that the Federal Reserve could do more to increase its cost consciousness and to operate as efficiently as possible. This bill will ensure that this happens and I look forward to greater discussion of this issue by Congress. I encourage the committee to give favorable consideration to our legislation. S. 2154. A bill to promote research to identify and evaluate the health effects of silicone breast implants, and to ensure that women and their doctors receive accurate information about such implants; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources. &lt;bullet&gt; Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that will make a significant difference in the lives of millions of American women--the Silicone Breast Implant Research and Information Act. There is one basic reason for this bill: to make sure women have accurate and complete information so they can make informed decisions about their health. Each year, nearly 180,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer in the United States. In total, approximately 2.6 million Americans live with breast cancer. When a women undergoes a mastectomy, she faces the decision of whether to have reconstructive surgery, and one important option she has is to have a silicone breast implant. Between 1 and 2 million women in the United States have received silicone breast implants over the last 35 years, as part of reconstructive surgery after mastectomy, or for cosmetic purposes. Many women with silicone implants have come forward with a variety of symptoms and atypical illnesses. Although research over the years has attempted to get to the bottom of this, we still don't have the answers women need and deserve. In 1992, the Food and Drug Administration restricted the availability of silicone breast implants because it had not received enough evidence to prove that these implants are safe. Currently, silicone breast implants are only available to women who have had breast cancer surgery or who have other special medical needs, such as a severe injury or birth defect. Women who need to have an implant replaced for medical reasons, such as rupture of the implant, are also eligible. These women should have access to the broadest possible treatment options--including breast implants. But it is just as essential that women can count on sound scientific research regarding the safety of implants. It is essential that the Federal Government coordinate its efforts on this issue to maximize the use of limited resources. This bill contains three components women need to make informed decisions about silicone breast implants--research, information, and coordination. It gives women not only options, but information and peace of mind. I am proud to introduce this bill in the Senate, and to be joined by Congressman Gene Green, who is introducing this bill in the House of Representatives. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: S. 2155. A bill to provide restitution of the economic potential lost to communities dependent on Spanish and Mexican Land Grants in New Mexico due to inadequate implementation of the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. &lt;bullet&gt; Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today, I introduce a bill to resolve a long standing controversy between many citizens of my State of New Mexico, and their government. In 1848, the United States entered into a treaty with Mexico to end the Mexican/American War called the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo. In that treaty, Mexico ceded an enormous tract of land that was to become the American Southwest including the State of New Mexico. In return the Treaty stipulated that the property rights of the Mexican citizens who lived in the area, and who were to become new citizens of the United States, would be protected. We must recall that these new citizens had had a long, and sometimes ancient, connection to the land. The Native American tribal peoples who had lived there for thousands of years, had become citizens of Spain and then Mexico. Also many of those new citizens of Spanish descent had a family heritage of living on the this land dating back 250 years to 1598, when the Spanish colonial capital in New Mexico was established at San Juan Pueblo. They had built towns and cities, churches, and vast irrigation systems for their farms. Unfortunately, the treaty provisions protecting title to land were not well and evenly implemented. It has been fairly well documented by scholars such as Professor Malcolm Ebright at the University of New Mexico, and Professor Emeritus Michael Meyer from the University of Northern Arizona, that many people lost title to their land who should have been protected by the treaty. In some cases this was due to faulty surveying by the Surveyor General, in some cases it was due to a lack of knowledge by American ","word.count":2891,"sep11":-3.33988764044944,"years":1998.51966292135,"days":1253,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0565298350502757,"Topic 2":0.215490380545515,"Topic 3":0.0106330730062276,"Topic 4":0.336523339824584,"Topic 5":0.048879679293097,"Topic 6":0.00216362691976779,"Topic 7":0.0161349057724649,"Topic 8":0.00433658299006943,"Topic 9":0.29987995669131,"Topic 10":0.00942861990668909},{"id":"10519980054385","body":"Patty Murray: Thank you, Mr. President I rise in strong support of this amendment and offer my congratulations to the Senator from Illinois for bringing this critical issue to the attention of the Senate and to the attention of the Nation.

For all of us who go out and visit schools on a regular basis, we see classrooms that are in cafeterias, in gymnasiums, and in closet space--of all things--all across this country, and that is wrong. This is an issue that has to be addressed. Let me also bring to the attention of my colleagues the issue that many of us hear about--the high number of jobs that are available today in the area of technology. The ITEA recently put out a study showing there are 200,000 job openings today. These are $40,000- to $60,000-a- year jobs available in technology, yet we don't have the skills or students with the skills available to go into these jobs because they haven't had the education and the experience in their schools. I have worked very hard to bring technology to the floor of the Senate as an issue. We have put computers into our schools, technology into our schools. In a few minutes, the Labor Committee will be working on the Reauthorization Act that includes my language to train teachers in technology throughout our schools, but if we don't pass the issue of school construction, far too many of our children will never have access to these skills because they are in classrooms where you cannot plug in a computer. This issue is critical and I urge my colleagues to support it. I, again, thank my colleague from Illinois for bringing it to our attention and appreciate her long concern and work on this issue.","word.count":307,"sep11":-3.53651685393258,"years":1998.32303370787,"days":1183,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0993999481661574,"Topic 2":0.0520851922900901,"Topic 3":0.226612386106852,"Topic 4":0.0297899397531005,"Topic 5":0.0331516870704771,"Topic 6":0.0106363828835531,"Topic 7":0.384788240449971,"Topic 8":0.111778016456183,"Topic 9":0.0488772736251203,"Topic 10":0.00288093319849497},{"id":"11020080025036","body":"Sheila Jackson-Lee: Let me thank my colleague Mr. Green for his outstanding leadership on the Financial Services Committee in the management of this bill. Let me also thank his co-manager on the floor as well, and I'd like to thank the chairman of the Financial Services Committee and his ranking member. Chairman Frank has been a champion of this legislation. His staff and the Financial Services Committee has been a supporter as we have made our way from the House, through the committee process, through the Senate, back to the House, and now back to the Senate. I think it's important to note that the House has the ability to legislate on revenue matters, and it is important as we pass this legislation for it to pass quickly in the Senate in order for this very worthy acknowledgment of the NASA 50th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act. I'm delighted to be the original cosponsor and author of this legislation, joined with my colleague Congressman John Culberson. I want to congratulate him and congratulate his staff. He has worked over a number of sessions, and we have collaborated on an institution that we've seen grow and thrive and improve over the years. This particular legislation is a commemoration of the 50 years of NASA. The year 2008 will mark the 50th anniversary of the creation of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA. This important legislation celebrates NASA's 50th birthday with a commemorative coin. The legislation also honors extraordinary partnerships between NASA and its 10 space and research centers. As a long-standing member of the Science Committee, I had the opportunity to visit most of NASA's space and research centers, and I hope as we stand on the floor today, each and every one of them, wherever they are located, will view this as a special tribute to them. This reflects the distinguished history of NASA. The United States of America won the race to land a man on the moon and subsequently had the opportunity to have women in space. And thanks to the courage, dedication and brilliance of NASA, America has continued to lead the world in the exploration of the solar system and the universe. On October 1, 1958, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration began operation. At the time, it consisted of only about 8,000 employees and an annual budget of $100 million. Over the next 50 years, NASA had been involved in many defining events which helped to shape human history. We consider the astronauts our heroes. And I've always enjoyed saying that at my annual Christmas party with 3,000 youngsters, the astronauts are more popular than Santa Claus. Many of us remember how inspired we were when on May 25, 1961, President John F. Kennedy proclaimed, ``I believe this Nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to Earth.'' We all know the phenomenon of ``The Right Stuff,'' the courageous men who first went into space. ``No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish'' as President Kennedy said as he referred to landing a person on the moon. Always at the forefront of technological innovation, NASA has been home to countless ``firsts'' in the field of space exploration, from the 1958 launch of Pioneer 3, the first U.S. satellite to ascend to an altitude of 63,000 miles, to the January 1998 signing of the International Space Station agreement between 15 countries, establishing the framework for cooperation among partners on the design, development, operation and utilization of the Space Station. Over the past 50 years, NASA's accomplishments have included many. I think it is important, Mr. Speaker, to note that many who have gone to the Space Station--and I'm putting in my reservation--have indicated that it is massive, it is enormous, it is powerful, it is impressive, it is as large as a football field. That is the genius of America. And this is the genius that we celebrate by this commemorative coin. I note, very briefly, on February 20, 1962, John Glenn became the first American to circle the Earth. Briefly, on April 6, 1965, the United States launched Intelsat I, the first commercial satellite. On November 13, 1961, the United States launched Mariner 9, the first mission to orbit another planet, that was Mars. On April 12, 1981, NASA launched the Space Shuttle Columbia. On January 18-24, 1983, NASA launched Space Shuttle Challenger!. On July 22, 1999, Space Shuttle Columbia's flight was led by Air Force Colonel Eileen Collins, the first woman to command a shuttle mission. On July 20, 1969, Apollo 11 astronauts Neil A. Armstrong and Edwin E. Aldrin made the first lunar landing mission while Michael Collins orbited overhead in the Apollo command module. On April 24, 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope was launched into space. So many firsts, but yet, of course, there were tragedies. And today, as we commemorate this coin or pass this legislation, we also acknowledge the fallen heroes in Columbia and Challenger, and the others who have found their dream of going into space shortened by this tragic incident. It is not safe, it is not easy, it is risky, but there are men and women, Americans, who are willing to go into space to be able to push the envelope to ensure that humanity has the kind of health resources or health research in HIV/AIDS and stroke and heart attacks to be able to move this Nation and humanity around the world to its highest level. I'm very pleased that we, in the Houston area, celebrate the Johnson Space Center, representing so many space centers around the world. I am even more pleased to have the opportunity, on more than one occasion, to welcome home the astronauts as they've landed at the Johnson Space Center. What a remarkable experience to hear their stories, to see their eyes light up as they express what it's like to be in space, to take a space walk. As our most recent mission evidenced, how important it is that space has reflected the diversity of America--Asians, Hispanics, African Americans, Caucasians, men, women, people from all over this Nation, and yes, our international partners from Japan, from Russia, from many places around the world. And what will this coin do? And we encourage, if I might, for everyone to be excited about this coin. I'm hoping that you will commemorate the passage of this legislation by securing to you the value of the NASA coins. You can say this on the floor of the House, we're not marketing, but we think it will be an outstanding and special historical artifact that you will really want to have. But it also serves to further the dream, the dream of space, the dream in the hearts and minds of young people. In this very important legislation the proceeds of the sale will benefit the life and legacy of Dr. Ronald E. McNair, a friend, a neighbor, a member of the Wheeler Avenue Baptist Church; the late Dr. Ronald E. McNair whose Educational Science Literacy Foundation is strengthening the connection of minority youngsters to math and science. It will also help the Challenger Center for Space Science Education, for the purposes of creating positive learning experiences using space science as a theme that raise student expectations of success. All of this will be, as well, celebrated by adding dollars to the NASA Families Assistance Fund, and that is, of course, the fund that provides for those who have lost their loved ones in the course of this historic opportunity. Mr. Speaker, let me acknowledge Jonathan Obee of the Financial Services Committee on this legislation. I also wish to pay tribute to Yohannes Tsehai of my staff, as I've indicated, again, to the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Frank, and of the subcommittees, and the ranking member of the full committee. I also want to acknowledge, as I indicated before, the manager of the bill from Houston and the manager from the minority who is managing this bill. In closing, Mr. Speaker, let me say this, that coins may represent some symbolism, but in the spirit of what NASA has meant to America, it is more than that. It is simply to say thank you; thank you to the brave men and women who are willing, yes, to sacrifice their life so that humanity can be lifted to a higher level. Learning what happens in space can improve the quality of lives of all Americans. And I hope this coin will remind young people today of the importance of math and science and pushing their own envelopes. I want to see more astronauts and more astronauts, more exploration, if you will, and the understanding of science to improve the quality of life of all of America and around the world. With that, I ask my colleagues to support this legislation and I thank Mr. Green for his time. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6455, the NASA 50th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act. I was pleased to introduce this bill and I thank my colleague, Mr. Culberson, who joined me in introducing this legislation, and Chairman Frank of the Financial Services Committee, for his excellent leadership in shepherding this historic legislation to passage on the House floor. The year 2008 will mark the 50th anniversary of the creation of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration . This important legislation celebrates NASA's 50th birthday with a commemorative coin. The legislation also honors the extraordinary partnerships between NASA and its 10 space and research centers.

Res. 157 which sheds light on the prisoners of conscience being held by the Chinese Government. These peaceful prisoners' only crimes were to speak out against the Chinese occupation of their homeland in Tibet. I would like to thank my distinguished colleague Mr. Udall for bringing this ongoing matter to the floor of this body. We can not ignore the plight of the Tibetan people while giving tacit support to the Chinese Government. One of the great marks of our Nation has been as a protector of human rights throughout the world. I recognize we may not be able to stop all international violations of human rights, but we certainly can not look the other way as the world's most populous nation blatantly occupies a peaceful country. For more than 50 years the Chinese Government has imposed its will on the people of Tibet. The Tibetan people have been unable to enjoy even the most basic rights under this Chinese occupation. Tibet had existed as a sovereign nation distinct from Chinese identity for over a thousand years. It was a nation that gave birth to the Buddhist faith and acted as the spiritual center for many people throughout the world. Now the people of Tibet can not even practice their own faith without fear of persecution. If we say we value human rights even a little bit how can we allow this deliberate oppression to continue? The prisoners of conscience being discussed in this resolution are a prime example of the kind of injustice that is inflicted on the peaceful Tibetan people. On October 14, 1989, Phuntsog Nyidron, a Tibetan Buddhist nun, and 5 other nuns from the Michungri Nunnery were arrested in Lhasa after chanting some slogans and marching in a procession as part of a peaceful demonstration that they organized to protest the Chinese occupation of Tibet. Their only real crime being that they believed they had the right to expression. Their only expression being their belief that Tibet deserved not to be occupied. Again I ask, how can we allow ourselves as a body to look the other way while this oppression continues to take place? Even in our darkest days as a nation we allowed the freedom of protest as long as it was peaceful. In the face of brutal oppression the Tibetan people have been nothing if not peaceful. So many Tibetans including the Dalai Lama have been forced in to exile, and still their message is one of peace. These brave people of Tibet pose no physical threat to China; instead it is their stoic resoluteness to obtain their rights that frightens the Chinese Government. Phuntsog Nyidron is the latest in the line of Tibetan leaders who have been imprisoned simply because they dared to voice their opposition to the Chinese occupation of their homeland. Let's not forget that Ms. Nyidron and those who were arrested with her were nuns. Since when have nuns become such a great threat to a government that they must be thrown in to prison and tortured? Since 1989 Ms. Nyidron has been subjected to torture and ill-treatment in the notorious Drapchi Prison which houses all female political prisoners. In 1993 Ms. Nyidron had her sentence extended to seventeen years simply because she and thirteen other nuns had secretly recorded songs about Tibetan independence and smuggled the recordings out of Drapchi prison. Once again I ask, where is the great threat to the Chinese government that requires a peaceful nun to be imprisoned for seventeen years? We now know that there are profound concerns for Ms. Nyidron's health as she is known to have liver, stomach and kidney problems which have no doubt been exacerbated by her brutal treatment in prison. It seems likely that the Chinese Government will be more than content to allow her to die in prison. The point of her imprisonment is not to eliminate a dangerous or threatening person, but instead to send a message to every other Tibetan that not only must they suffer Chinese occupation, but that they must do so in silence. This, Mr. Speaker, is unacceptable. I call on every Member of this body to support this resolution. Let us send a message to every Tibetan who lives in fear that they have an ally in their struggle for their rights. Let us also send a message to the Chinese Government that the United States of America still holds the banner as the international protector of human rights and that we will not turn a blind eye to the open and vicious oppression of the Tibetan people. For more than fifty years they have endured this occupation with great dignity and an enduring faith. They are a living testament to the fact that brutality cannot crush the spirit of even the most oppressed people. I ask the Chinese people to come to the aid of these great human rights proponents. I hope the Chinese government will see fit to listen. I look forward to that dialogue.","word.count":846,"sep11":2.45786516853933,"years":2004.31741573034,"days":3317,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0455861149987036,"Topic 2":0.0235627101601532,"Topic 3":0.0148827281404753,"Topic 4":0.531909428507354,"Topic 5":0.00323831488344776,"Topic 6":0.313951835990263,"Topic 7":0.0318586913021189,"Topic 8":0.0166381790002245,"Topic 9":0.0080350114170057,"Topic 10":0.0103369856002539},{"id":"10920050078088","body":"Harry Reid: Mr. President, 2 weeks ago the President nominated Judge Samuel A. Alito to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States. I congratulate Judge Alito on this high honor. I pledge that the Senate Democrats will help ensure a thorough and dignified confirmation process. While I approach the confirmation process with an open mind, even at this early stage I have a number of significant concerns I want to share with my colleagues. First, the President's selection of Judge Alito was not at all the product of consultation with Senate Democrats, as envisioned by the Founding Fathers. On two prior occasions President Bush spoke with me. He invited Senator Leahy and me to the White House to discuss the future of the Supreme Court. The President listened seriously to our views and appeared to understand that the job of filling judicial vacancies is a constitutional responsibility that he shares with the Senate. But this time, instead of an invitation to the White House, I received nothing more than a pro forma telephone call from the President's Chief of Staff, telling me he had selected Judge Alito about an hour before he announced the nomination. In fact, the President did consult about the Alito nomination but with the wrong people. It wasn't with me and it wasn't with Senator Leahy. According to widely recognized press reports, the White House consulted with conservative activists to make sure the President would not disappoint them with his selection. I think the term conservative activists is probably very broad, too broad; with some extremes--extreme on the right wing. Some of these extreme Web sites received word of the Alito nomination before any Senate Democrat was even consulted or informed. Consultation is not just a courtesy; it is a way for the President to ensure that a candidate for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court receives broad bipartisan support in Congress. That was what our Founding Fathers talked about. That is why that provision is in the Constitution. The constitutional design commands a partnership in this endeavor, not mere notification of the coequal branch of Government. The second reason I have early concerns about this nomination is that it represents an abandonment of the principle that the Supreme Court should be comprised of highly qualified individuals with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and heritages. It is so striking that President Bush has chosen a man to replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the first of only two women ever appointed to the Supreme Court. Today, unlike 24 years ago, when Sandra Day O'Connor herself was nominated, more than half of the Nation's law students are women. There are countless qualified women on the bench, in elective office, in law firms, and serving as law school deans and law professors. I cannot believe the President searched this country and was unable to find a qualified female nominee. But maybe he was unable to find a qualified female nominee who happened to satisfy the extreme right wing of the Republican Party. Meanwhile, for the third time the President has turned down the opportunity to make history by nominating the first Hispanic to the Supreme Court. How much longer must Hispanics wait before they see someone on the Nation's highest Court who shares their ethnic heritage and their shared experiences? At the same time, the appointment of Judge Alito largely fails to diversify the Court in terms of professional experience. Judge Alito is a long-serving Federal appellate judge who would join eight other justices with that very same professional credential. While his prior service as a Federal prosecutor is commendable and worthwhile, he was essentially an appellate lawyer like a number of the sitting justices. We have come a long way from the days when Senators, bar leaders, trial lawyers, leading professors and others with a wide range of life experiences were routinely appointed to the Supreme Court. If Judge Alito is confirmed, the range of professional diversity on the Court will extend all the way from those who served on the D.C. Circuit to those who served on the First, Third, Seventh, or Ninth Circuit before their promotions. The third and most important basis for my early concern about the Alito nomination is the fact that he was nominated following the forced withdrawal of White House Counsel Harriet Miers. Harriet Miers received a raw deal from her critics. This woman had been the managing partner of a major American law firm, the first female president of the Dallas Bar Association--which, by the way, is larger than most State bar associations. She was the first female president of the Texas Bar Association. She had been one of the Nation's leaders in promoting opportunities for women lawyers and minority lawyers. She has been a champion of ensuring legal representation for the poor. She was a trial lawyer. The one-dimensional portrait her opponents painted of her was malicious and unfair. Let's not sugarcoat the truth. The nomination of Harriet Miers was derailed by the overwhelming opposition of the extreme right wing. They campaigned against her, they ran paid advertising against her, and they finally succeeded in having the President cave in to these radical right wing activists. They succeeded in defeating her nomination even before this fine woman was afforded an opportunity to make her case to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Earlier this year we heard Senator after Senator on the other side of the aisle, and conservative commentators across the airwaves, declare that every judicial nominee is entitled to an up-or-down vote. I have a question for those Senators, those commentators: When exactly will Harriet Miers receive her up-or-down vote? The White House made a half-hearted effort to argue that the Miers nomination was withdrawn in the face of an impasse over what documents would be provided to the Senate. That is a pretext, a laughable cover story. She was forced to withdraw by conservative activists who want to change the legal landscape of America. They decided she was inadequately radical or insufficiently aggressive for their purposes, so they gave her the boot. You don't have to take my word for it. Listen to the words of John Danforth, our former colleague, Senator from Missouri and, until recently, President Bush's Ambassador to the United Nations. He was asked on CNN recently who he thought were the winners in the Miers episode. I quote his answer: Senator Danforth is himself a pro-life Republican and an ordained Episcopal priest, but listen to what he says about his fellow Republicans: Senator Danforth has revealed an important truth about today's Republican Party. His warnings are precisely why the Senate needs to take a long, hard look at the Alito nomination. Even in the first 2 weeks of the confirmation process, a picture of Sam Alito is emerging that may explain why the extreme right wing is popping champagne corks. Earlier this week we learned of the 1985 memo in which Alito said, ``I am, and always have been a conservative.'' He also spoke proudly of his work on behalf of an extremely conservative agenda of the Reagan Justice Department. We don't have to guess whether Judge Alito's description of himself in that memo would predict what kind of a judge he would be. For the past 15 years, Judge Alito has been one of the most conservative judges in the country--some would say extreme. For example, in civil rights cases he has often dissented to argue for higher barriers to recovery for people with claims of discrimination. In Bray v. Marriott Hotels, his colleagues said Title VII of the Civil Rights Act ``would be eviscerated'' if Judge Alito's approach were followed. In Nathanson v. Medical College of Pennsylvania, he dissented in a disability rights case where the majority said, ``few if any Rehabilitation Cases would survive'' if Judge Alito's views were the law. And in Sheridan v. DuPont, he was the only one of 11 judges on the court who would apply a higher standard of proof in sex discrimination cases. In another area of law, Judge Alito has been quick to limit the authority of Congress, even when it is working to help people solve real problems. In Chittester v. Department of Community Development, he held that the Constitution did not allow a State employee to enforce the Family and Medical Leave Act. The Supreme Court effectively repudiated that view 3 years later in the Hibbs case from my own State of Nevada. These are a few of Judge Alito's many judicial opinions which merit close review by the Senate. By all accounts, Sam Alito is a decent man, well liked by his colleagues. He has devoted his entire legal career to public service, and for that I admire him. Throughout the confirmation process I will work to ensure that Judge Alito is treated with civility and respect. But there is nothing disrespectful about an open and fair- minded review of a nominee's approach to the Constitution and his commitment to the core American values such as equality, privacy, fairness. One final point. This nomination will be governed by the 200-year-old rules of the Senate. I was very dismayed to read an essay by the majority leader in the Chicago Tribune last week in which he threatened to change the rules of the Senate to ensure that Judge Alito would be confirmed. Think about that. My friend, the majority leader, wrote: The majority leader's accusation is baseless. Democrats can hardly persist in an activity in which we are not engaged. No Democrat has even raised the issue of extended debate. At this early stage of the process, 2 months before committee hearings on this nomination will begin, it is silly to argue about the terms of floor debate. Earlier this year, the entire Senate breathed a sigh of relief when the so- called ``nuclear option'' was averted by an agreement of a bipartisan group of Senators. We don't know what is going to happen on this nomination.

Jackson: Let me take this opportunity to congratulate the distinguished gentleman from Louisiana [Mr. Fields] for the vigilance that he has shown and the people of the Fourth Congressional District of Louisiana as they have fought to uphold the law of the 1965 Voting Rights Act which has in part and in no small measure created the kind of diversity in the Federal Government, the kind of diversity in State government, the kind of diversity in political legislative bodies all across our country. There has never been since Plessy versus Ferguson was decided in 1897 which ran 22 African-Americans out of this distinguished body and ran African-Americans and other minorities out of State legislatures around this country the kind of representation that African-Americans, Latinos, women, and other minorities in this country presently have come to appreciate. I want to offer certainly a level of congratulations again to the gentleman from Louisiana for those State legislators who are presently in Louisiana filibustering the attempt by that State legislature to undermine the Fourth Congressional District of Louisiana. I want to offer this evening an historical perspective and then hear from the gentleman from Louisiana and then engage the gentleman in a colloquy about the sustenance of the Voting Rights Act of 1968. In June 1993, the Supreme Court handed down a decision that threatened to return this country to the days of separate but equal. The decision in voting rights mocked the reality of persistent racial inequality in America in the name of a color-blind society. Using the Constitution's guarantee of equality, the Court has given the green light to willful racial exclusion in the political process. In the past, damaging interpretations of civil rights laws could be minimized by congressional amendments to clarify the law. The Court's ruling in these voting rights cases calls into question our ability to seek redress in this, the body of the people. In Shaw versus Reno, after the creation of majority African-American congressional districts in North Carolina, blacks elected the first African-American to Congress since Reconstruction. Even with two majority African-American districts, white voters who make up 76 percent of that State's population, continued to control more than their share, 83 percent, of North Carolina congressional seats. Yet the Court suggested that one majority black district, because it was irregular in shape, was nothing more than an effort to segregate the races, and I quote, for the purposes of voting. It said that such a district would, quote unquote, threaten to carry us further from the goal of a political system in which race no longer matters. The Court is, in fact, saying that racial injustice no longer exists. In reality, we live in a political system that is so racially divided that race matters more than any one factor in a voter's choice of candidates in American. Political encumbents whose main goal in redistricting is to insure their own reelection, they know this. And when they draw the district lines, computer technology can tell them the racial composition of every census block. Indeed, many majority white districts are drawn to exclude African-Americans and preserve white constituencies in the last reapportionment, they look as unusual as the black districts singled out by the Supreme Court. In many cases, compact minority districts are hard to draw because African-Americans and Hispanics are concentrated in isolated communities. The census blocks in these communities were defined long ago by legalized residential segregation. This was the target of Dr. King's last civil rights march in 1966. Creating majority black districts does not harm white voters. Indeed, there is no State in the country in which whites are underrepresented in State legislatures or in this body, the 104th Congress. Even with enforcement of the Voting Rights Act, African-Americans and other minorities continue to be barred from their fair share of political power nationwide. Given the racial division among voters and the bitter history of African-American electoral exclusion, African-American districts provide the most widely accepted means of allowing black voters full participation, a bear minimum for citizenship in this democracy. Concern with the shape of a district should obviously pale in comparison. When Shaw versus Reno was decided, too many in the voting rights community initially sought to characterize it as a narrow decision which, while potentially damaging, it was not a fundamental attack on the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. I was very concerned about this opinion because I viewed it as a signal that it would encourage those opposed to the Voting Rights Act to challenge it everywhere. This is exactly what has happened since the Shaw decision. Mr. Speaker, voting rights and the law protecting these rights were one of the few areas to remain largely intact following the Reagan and Bush onslaught. In voting rights cases, they must first prove intentional discrimination on the part of the State to succeed in a Voting Rights Act case. Congress disagreed with the City of Mobile versus Bolden and they disagreed with the Supreme Court's interpretation and ruling in the Bolden case, and in 1982, they amended the Voting Rights Act to specifically overrule that decision. In fact, Congress strengthened the Voting Rights Act on a bipartisan basis to make it plain that discrimination against minority voters continued to persist and that an important test was not intent, which is often difficult to prove, but instead was the effect on minority voters. In 1986, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the 1982 amendments in Thornburg versus Gingles, and it was against this background that the State legislatures determined the Constitution required that majority-minority districts be drawn to avoid violating the law. The Shaw decision resurrected the intent question by turning the Voting Rights Act on its head in order to recognize the right of white plaintiffs, who do not even live in these congressional districts, to challenge districts that were intended in the first place to lead to greater minority representation in this body, in the Louisiana State Legislature and the North Carolina Legislature, in State legislatures around this country. The objective of the Voting Rights Act was to desegregate the institutions of power that heretofore historically had been denied to African-Americans, women, and to other minorities. Most recently, in the Fifth Circuit decision in Hays versus Louisiana, they sought to apply Shaw to answer a totally different question: Is there a compelling State interest in designating a congressional district using race as one of many criteria so that racial minorities have an equal opportunity of winning? The court in Hays concluded that the Louisiana plan, the seat of the gentleman from Louisiana [Mr. Fields] was not narrowly tailored to further a compelling State interest. Hayes was obviously troubling for a number of reasons. To recognize the standing of white citizens to attack majority-minority districts, the court cited regents of the University of California versus Bakke in 1978, in addition to Shaw and Croson. Thus, the fact of a color-blind Constitution and country was elevated by the case in Louisiana, Hays versus Louisiana, to strike down the Louisiana plan. The Hays court relied on a 1964 decision, Wright versus Rockefeller, a case that was decided before the Voting Rights Act of 1964, to define a racially gerrymandered districting plan as one that, quote unquote, intentionally draws one or more districts along racial lines or otherwise segregates citizens into voting districts based on their race. The court also cited Bolden in support of this point. The Hays court seems to have ignored the fact that the 1982 amendments by this Congress overturned Bolden. The only citation the court makes of those amendments is to assert that section 2 expressly declares that proportional representation is not required. On Thursday, June 30, 1994, exactly 1 year to the day after the Shaw versus Reno decision undermined a North Carolina redistricting plan designed to give African-Americans greater representation after Reconstruction, the Court struck again. In two separate opinions, a Florida case, Johnson versus DeGrande, and a Georgia case Holder versus Hall, the Court sought to limit a broad interpretation of section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Section 2 outlaws all forms of voter discrimination. Congress intended a broad interpretation so as to be able to address the various and subtle forms of voter denial, but the Court appears increasingly unwilling to use an interpretation that expands the notion of democracy for all Americans. As a New York Times editorial said, the Court was driven by a core of justices who evince no respect for Congress whatsoever. Justice Clarence Thomas and Mr. Antonin Scalia are leading the challenge against the Voting Rights Act. And so today, there are legislators in Louisiana who are engaged in a filibuster so that the Fourth Congressional District of Louisiana will remain intact. I brought, today, a map to show the changes that the Fourth Congressional District of Louisiana has gone through in the last year. In the Louisiana case, the Court said racial gerrymandering was unconstitutional. In a State 30-percent black, only two Congresspersons have been elected since Reconstruction. The first Louisiana plan, 65 percent black, 35 percent white. The second Louisiana plan after this plan was thrown out created a new congressional district, 55 percent black, 45 percent white. And now the State legislature in Louisiana is presently filibustering to keep the third plan from becoming a matter of law, thus moving this district 70 percent white to 30 percent black. So a district that is almost 50 percent black and 50 percent white has been d","word.count":1641,"sep11":-5.54494382022472,"years":1996.31460674157,"days":468,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.12560818906915,"Topic 2":0.0217663044993706,"Topic 3":0.00278803756871559,"Topic 4":0.00821797477743429,"Topic 5":0.00168289489569471,"Topic 6":0.00413615923606942,"Topic 7":0.00747094000355632,"Topic 8":0.01293173755457,"Topic 9":0.812781129842471,"Topic 10":0.00261663255296746},{"id":"10620000079624","body":"Tom Harkin: Mr. President, I commend and congratulate my friend and colleague from Pennsylvania for introducing this legislation to set up a commission.

We just have not adopted that new technology.

I think it is unfortunate that the Democrats have chosen confusion and misleading the seniors and getting lower prescription drugs as available to them through the new strengthening and improvement of the Medicare system. Our Members have been home talking to seniors. To answer the question how will seniors be able to choose, our Members are home helping seniors go through the system and choosing the kind of discount card and the kind of program that best benefits them, rather than trying to confuse them. But, Mr. Speaker, I came here to talk about something a little bit different. Mr. Speaker, every year for 1,000 different reasons, and all of them our fault, American families are squeezed by the invisible grip of hidden taxes. These are laws and regulations, all of which are well intentioned, that cost our economy billions of dollars, billions of man hours and millions of new jobs. In addition to income taxes, customers and consumers are stuck with regulatory compliance costs, litigation costs, interest payments on the national debt, and governmental waste, fraud and abuse. And all of these are eventually passed on to unsuspecting consumers in the form of higher prices. This week the House will take up two bills specifically targeting some of those hidden taxes. The first of these will be the Middle Class Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act from the gentleman from Connecticut . This legislation will protect 11 million working families and individuals from the unintended consequences of the Democrat-designed AMT, a tax provision preventing the wealthy from dodging their tax liability through creative accounting. Unfortunately, many middle income families have so benefited from Republican tax relief in 2001 and 2003, that the AMT now considers them rich. Now, while deep down many Democrats may indeed consider a family earning $45,000 per year to be rich, the majority of the people in this country, and thankfully in this body, have a more realistic view of 21st century economics. The Simmons bill is the first step towards making sure that the AMT only applies to those people it was designed to cover, not working families just trying to enjoy the fruits of their labor. Also this week, Mr. Speaker, in the House we plan to take up the conference report on one of the strongest, most disciplined budgets Congress has passed in two decades. It meets our present and reemerging needs while holding a firm line on discretionary spending. By setting a course of fiscal responsibility even in a time of war, we are giving the American people an opportunity to grow our economy back into balance, thereby protecting them from any more hidden taxes in the future. Mr. Speaker, for generations Americans have been saddled with taxes that are too high and a government that is not responsive enough. This week we will take two small steps toward solving both of those problems.","word.count":886,"sep11":1.61797752808989,"years":2003.47752808989,"days":3018,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.107854562780217,"Topic 2":0.0494609200688948,"Topic 3":0.0132921878466735,"Topic 4":0.00878604446162141,"Topic 5":0.157245389267054,"Topic 6":0.0114600258204275,"Topic 7":0.00485059400354565,"Topic 8":0.559659224823238,"Topic 9":0.0570494006108493,"Topic 10":0.0303416503174786},{"id":"10519980011101","body":"Cliff Stearns: Madam Speaker, Members often take to the floor to talk about our government, how it is working or not working. In fact, I have done that myself occasionally. Today, my colleagues, I will talk about a government program that does work. My colleagues will hear about how a little funding in the hands of a caring and committed group of individuals can make a huge difference in the lives of hundreds of young people. I want to share with my colleagues today a story about the Weed and Seed Program that has helped transform the Howard Middle School in my hometown of Ocala, Florida. In 1993, I contacted the Attorney General, Janet Reno, in support of bringing the Weed and Seed Program to Florida. Since then, communities near and about my district, including Gainesville, Jacksonville, and Ocala have received funding through this program. The Weed and Seed Program coordinates the use of law enforcement and criminal prosecution to weed out criminal offenders in the targeted neighborhoods and ``seeds'' the community with housing employment and various social programs. I have long supported the goals of the Weed and Seed Program because, Madam Speaker, it is community based and not an entangling government bureaucracy. The Howard Middle School in my home town of Ocala, Florida, has nurtured this seed into a wonderful product. The school has developed creative after-school activities that keep the students positively engaged. This is important because, as we all know, Madam Speaker, nearly 5 million school-aged children spend time without adult supervision during a typical week. Research indicates that during these unsupervised hours, children are more likely to engage in at-risk behavior, such as crime and drug use. In fact, the FBI reports that most juvenile crime takes place between the hours of 3 p.m. and 8 p.m. Unfortunately, 70 percent of all public schools do not offer after- school programs. Howard Middle School is one of the valuable exceptions. Last week I visited this school to witness firsthand the community services it has developed. I was greeted by the principal, Scott Hackmyer; Joan Spainhower, public relations officer; Dan Greer, safe and drug free school specialist; and Ms. Myers, the comprehensive health coordinator. I was escorted to a small conference room where the principal gave an overview of the program. During this briefing a student, Sharika Palmer, an 8th grader in the Hair and Nails Program, instructed me on how a manicure program is implemented. Miss Sharon Samuels is one of the teacher assistants hired using Weed and Seed money, and she created the Hair and Nails Program. Coach Ron Nealis is another caring individual who was hired using these funds. The principal has staffed the school with dedicated individuals who give unselfishly with their time and talents, including Barbara Flemming, who coaches ``The Steppers,'' dancers; and Ms. Weaver and Ms. Faso, who coach the cheerleaders. Together they have created an after- school support group, rich with instruction in many studies and activities, and providing supervision during those critical hours when most parents are at work. There are sports, cheerleading, dancing groups, chess clubs, and the Hair and Nail group. Unique to this program is a ``neighborhood mentor,'' a program designed solely for those children who ride the bus to school and, consequently, must leave school at the normal time. Instead of depriving them of these special programs, arrangements were made with two neighborhood churches to allow a teacher to accompany these children and use the building for these programs. The principal has received a commitment from six churches to participate next year, meaning that after-school mentoring will reach into virtually every student's neighborhood. The coach told us an example of a young person, a young man, who was getting D's and F's in school until he got into the coach's fitness and basketball program. Now, I am happy to say this student is an honor roll student. This last semester there are 436 students on the honor roll, and that is nearly double the numbers before this after-school program was instituted. Not only have the students become better students, but vandalism and police calls in the area have greatly diminished. The principal is to be commended and his caring faculty and staff have indeed put the Weed and Seed money to exceptional use. I congratulate him, the staff, the faculty, and, most importantly, the students of Howard Middle School in Ocala, Florida for a job well done. Keep up the outstanding work.","word.count":745,"sep11":-3.44101123595506,"years":1998.41853932584,"days":1217,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.133155054341006,"Topic 2":0.486394008745663,"Topic 3":0.0161513242310447,"Topic 4":0.218689769144417,"Topic 5":0.0167820373602744,"Topic 6":0.0182282511816947,"Topic 7":0.0275824066352679,"Topic 8":0.0315893101152672,"Topic 9":0.0416440584779914,"Topic 10":0.00978377976737419},{"id":"10920060010931","body":"Nick Rahall: Mr. Chairman, this amendment has been passed unanimously by this House in previous years, including last year. Mr. Chairman, last year the House voted 249 to 159 to adopt my amendment to end the sale and slaughter of wild horses and burros. I ask the House today to reaffirm the stand it took to protect these icons of America's western heritage. Earlier this year the Nevada State Quarter was issued by the U.S. Mint. Now, Nevada is known as the ``Silver State.'' However, if you look on the back of the quarter, you will not see a picture of a silver mine. No, what the good people of Nevada chose as the representation of their state was a wild horse. Nevadans are rightly proud of the heritage of their wild horses. It is unfortunately a heritage at risk because of a legislative rider inserted into an Appropriations bill in the dead of night in late 2004 that puts thousands of wild horses and burros in danger of ending up on dining tables overseas. We need to stop the slaughter of wild horses and burros not only because it is morally wrong but also because the program itself is a failure. As a result of this failure, 41 wild horses have been slaughtered and thousands more face an uncertain fate. While the Bureau of Land Management may have good intentions to prevent sales for slaughter, the legislative rider that created this problem in the first place severely handicaps any such effort. Make no mistake about it, more wild horses and burros will end up slaughtered. After all, if the purpose of the legislative rider was to only sell off these animals to good homes, why was the long-standing prohibition on slaughter removed from the law. According to the BLM's own statistics, the agency has approximately the same number of wild horse and burros in the sale program today as when the program started. For each one the agency has sold, another one has been added to take its place. BLM has resorted to sending out letters to public land ranchers pleading with them to buy a horse. It has teamed up with a private entity to offer limited financial incentives to purchasers. These are not the actions of a sound program but the desperate attempts to implement and unwise and unsound policy. Mr. Chairman, the wild horse and burro program is a failure both morally and administratively. We can and must do a better job of protecting these magnificent creatures. It is time to sheath the sword that hangs over these animals. I urge the adoption of my amendment.

This bill addresses an urgent issue which is critical to our Nation's security and public health: The threat of bioterror and pandemic disease. Last week the State Department issued a warning that the continuing spread of a highly contagious avian influenza virus among animals in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Europe has the potential to significantly threaten human health. The virus has already caused nearly 150 human deaths around the world. If a virus such as H5N1 mutates and spreads easily from one person to another, avian influenza could break out globally. While there are no reports of sustained human-to-human transmission of avian influenza, the U.S. government and international health agencies are scrambling to prepare for a possible pandemic. In hearings earlier this year on the Project Bioshield Act, it was apparent that gaps remain in our effort to address emerging threats to public health. In particular, we learned that very few companies are willing to risk their limited resources to develop the vaccines and antidotes to respond to chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear attacks or to a fast-spreading influenza such as H5N1. Put simply, there is little economic incentive for companies to conduct the vital research necessary in this field. The centerpiece of our legislation is a new office within HHS, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority , which will be a single point of federal authority for the development of medical countermeasures. The bill enables the Secretary of HHS and the BARDA Director to collaborate and consult with agency leaders, academia, and industry on developing needed medical countermeasures and pandemic or epidemic products. This bill also empowers BARDA to make milestone payments to drug developers at key stages of their work, helping to reduce the financial risks of taking on such a great challenge. This legislation has broad bipartisan support in the House of Representatives and the Senate, and I thank the bill's many cosponsors for their support. I especially want to thank Congressman Mike Rogers for his leadership on this issue. This bill demonstrates the good that can come out of bipartisan teamwork and I'm proud to have worked with him to make this bill a reality. I also want to thank Chairmen Barton and Deal as well as Ranking Member Dingell for acknowledging the importance of this legislation and working with us every step of the way to get it done before the end of the year. I also want to thank the staff members who have put so much time and energy into this legislation: Kelly Childress with Representative Rogers, Nandan Kenkeremath with Chairman Barton, Brandon Clark with Chairman Deal, John Ford with Representative Dingell, and Jason Mahler and Jennifer Nieto of my staff.

This step is the space-based interceptor, SBI, study that was recently funded in H.R. 2638, the fiscal year 2009 Continuing Resolution, which contains the fiscal year 2009 appropriations for the Department of Defense. Congress appropriated $5 million for the Secretary of Defense to conduct an independent assessment of a space-based interceptor element of our missile defense system. This is the first time since the Clinton administration and a Democrat-controlled Congress in 1993 cancelled all work towards a space-based layer missile defense system that we have the potential to expand our space-based capabilities from mere space situational awareness to space protection. In the past 15 years, the ballistic missile threat has substantially increased and is now undeniable. Today, at least 27 nations have ballistic missile defense capabilities, and last year alone over 120 foreign ballistic missiles were launched. North Korea and Iran are developing and proliferating ballistic missile technology and continue to be major threats to our allies and our deployed forces. Developments in China, as illustrated in the 2008 Annual Report on Military Power of the People's Republic of China, raise the concern about accidental or unauthorized launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles, ICBMs, by China's military. In addition to the long-established threat of ballistic missiles as a delivery system for weapons of mass destruction, on January 11, 2007, the world witnessed the vulnerability of space assets when China launched a ballistic missile to destroy a satellite. This capability extends beyond China; the Director of National Intelligence recently testified, ``over the last decade, the rest of the world has made significant progress in developing counter space capabilities.'' Every part of our daily lives depends upon the capability and reliability of our space systems. An attack on our space systems would not only adversely affect our military and intelligence systems, but also items such as: the Internet backbone, financial systems, navigation systems, manufacturing inventory control systems, emergency response systems, and weather tracking. Our vulnerabilities have not gone unnoticed; Wang Hucheng, an analyst for the People's Liberation Army has called our space systems the ``soft ribs'' of the U.S. military. The $5 million appropriation for the SBI study allows the Secretary of Defense to enter into a contract with one or more independent entities to review the feasibility and advisability of developing a space-based interceptor element to the ballistic missile defense system. It is clear from the project tables in H.R. 2638, specifically the Program Element numbers in those tables, that Congress understood the importance of funding this study. I have the utmost confidence in Secretary Gates to make the decision about what research and development entity should perform this study. I would like to recommend that an entity like the Institute for Defense Analysis, IDA, lead the study. IDA has the experience and technical expertise to provide policymakers a complete picture of the merits of a space-based interceptor system. The study could lead to the development of new technologies and concepts that would provide the United States, our allies, and our deployed forces protection from the threat of rapidly proliferating ballistic missile technology, as well as the rising threat of attacks on our vulnerable national security space systems. I would like to share the views of a few senior military leaders about what they believe to be the benefits of conducting the space- based interceptor study. GEN Kevin Chilton, Commander of United States Strategic Command, stated: GEN Henry Obering, Director of Missile Defense Agency, stated, the study is ``a pragmatic hedge against an uncertain future, not an acquisition program for space-based missile defenses. It is opportunity to learn--while there is time to learn--what is possible in space against the day when emerging threats may compel us to decide.'' MG Thomas Deppe, Vice Commander of Air Force Space Command stated: The United States must study space-based defenses now while we actually have the time to gather the data necessary to make informed policy decisions and before we are forced to make a decision in a time of crisis. I would like to thank Senators Inhofe, Allard, and Sessions for their support in ensuring this important initiative was funded. This study--some in this body have been afraid of--will help Congress understand what a space-based layer in our missile defense system could do to defend this Nation from ballistic missile attacks and threats to our space systems.","word.count":745,"sep11":7.23314606741573,"years":2009.09269662921,"days":5017,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.016313118675293,"Topic 2":0.293256960506215,"Topic 3":0.0649702330997472,"Topic 4":0.00463485080067696,"Topic 5":0.0149392954127071,"Topic 6":0.580978246602185,"Topic 7":0.00578951890174515,"Topic 8":0.00905018309533601,"Topic 9":0.00754587621788476,"Topic 10":0.0025217166882098},{"id":"11020070078657","body":"Richard J. Durbin: Mr. President, there is an amendment that has been filed and may be considered this evening, which I think is extremely important. I wish to speak to it. It is the McConnell amendment, offered by the Republican leader, amendment 1170, to the immigration bill. This amendment has very little to do with this immigration bill, but it is one of the most important issues any Congress could ever consider. It is about Americans' right to vote. The right to vote is the most fundamental right in a free and Democratic society. In fact, in Reynolds v. Sims, the Supreme Court called it ``preservative of other basic civil and political rights.'' I think that is fair warning to all of us that when we consider the McConnell amendment, we should understand this is not just another amendment. This amendment goes to the heart of our franchise as Americans. It goes to the heart of our democracy. We have come a long way in our country on the issue of voting rights. Last year, we reauthorized the historic Voting Rights Act, the landmark act passed in 1965 safeguarding the right to vote for millions of Americans who had been denied that fundamental right for generations. The amendment offered by Senator McConnell to this immigration bill will undermine the Voting Rights Act. It will restrict voting rights in America. It will diminish the voting rights of our American citizens, particularly minorities, the poor, the elderly, and the disabled. That is a historic decision. This is not another commonplace amendment; it is an amendment of great moment. I might add, the McConnell amendment is opposed by nearly every major civil rights group in America today. The McConnell amendment, simply stated, would require that all Americans bring a government-issued, current, valid photo ID with them when they vote. The idea may sound reasonable on its face until you look closely. The fact is, many Americans don't have a photo ID. Twelve percent of Americans don't have a driver's license. Who are those 12 percent? By and large, they are minorities, the poor, the elderly, and the disabled. A 2005 University of Wisconsin study showed that over 50 percent of African-American and Hispanic adults in Milwaukee don't have a valid driver's license. The McConnell amendment will have a disproportionately negative impact on these groups. It will diminish their right to vote. Second, the McConnell amendment may be on its face unconstitutional. The State of Georgia passed a photo ID law in 2005, and it was struck down by the courts. A Federal district court judge said it constituted a modern-day ``poll tax'' and was presumptively unconstitutional. An appellate panel of three judges, including two Republican appointees, agreed. What gave rise to the Georgia photo ID law? Was there a history of election fraud in that State? No. The Georgia secretary of state said she was unaware of a single documented case in recent years of fraud through impersonation of a voter at the polls. Cries of voter fraud are heard over and over again. It is one of Karl Rove's inspired strategies to keep raising this issue. But these are phantom cries. Look at the numbers. Since 2002, 196 million votes have been cast in Federal elections. Do you know how many voter fraud convictions there have been from those 196 million votes? Fifty-two out of 196 million. Most of these were for vote-buying and voter registration fraud, neither of which would be stopped by a photo ID. Sadly, and cynically, photo ID laws are being pushed by some for partisan reasons. Seventh Circuit Judge Terrence Evans wrote, while dissenting in a recent Federal case that upheld a photo ID law in Indiana: We have recently learned about the troubling role played by partisan political appointees at Alberto Gonzales's Justice Department in clearing the Georgia photo ID law. According to press reports, the career staff at the Justice Department made a recommendation to object to the Georgia photo ID law because they believed it would have a discriminatory impact on minority voters. But the career employees at the Department of Justice were overruled by the political appointees of the President and Alberto Gonzales. One of these political appointees, Bradley Schlozman, was rewarded by receiving a U.S. attorney appointment in Kansas City, MO--job well done for Mr. Schlozman. He went to Kansas City and decided he would continue to pursue the Karl Rove strategy of voter fraud. By any objective measure, Mr. Schlozman was unqualified to be a U.S. attorney. As he testified earlier today at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Mr. Schlozman had never worked as a prosecutor and never even tried a case. But by embracing this phantom voter strategy of Karl Rove in Georgia, Mr. Schlozman earned his stripes and was promoted. In the eyes of Karl Rove, Kyle Sampson, and Monica Goodling, he was a ``loyal Bushie.'' I was proud to cosponsor a resolution in 2005 by my colleague, Senator Obama. The resolution condemned the Justice Department's approval of the Georgia photo ID law and expressed the sense of Congress that requiring a photo ID in order to vote places a discriminatory burden on voting rights. The McConnell amendment is an attempt to impose the Georgia photo ID law on America. This measure was debated and defeated in 2002 when we enacted the Help America Vote Act. It should be defeated again now. I realize the photo ID requirement was proposed a few years ago by a bipartisan commission. But since that commission report was issued, new research conducted for the bipartisan Election Assistance Commission has shown that photo ID requirements reduced turnout in the 2004 election by 3 percent. It showed that with voter ID requirements, Hispanics were 10 percent less likely to vote and African Americans 6 percent less likely. Is that what we should do in Congress--create barriers for minorities to vote? The McConnell amendment is unfair and unconstitutional. I urge my colleagues to oppose it. I yield the floor.","word.count":1000,"sep11":5.87921348314607,"years":2007.73876404494,"days":4535,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0761741306993993,"Topic 2":0.451037478350894,"Topic 3":0.00427787050573913,"Topic 4":0.0249117519291201,"Topic 5":0.00610847744950463,"Topic 6":0.00626150939708436,"Topic 7":0.268161061530401,"Topic 8":0.00592512984422248,"Topic 9":0.153920916039683,"Topic 10":0.0032216742539523},{"id":"11020080059643","body":"Johnny Isakson: Mr. President, the Senator from New Hampshire has made a compelling speech with which I associate myself entirely. It is obvious he has traveled to his State, as I have traveled to mine, and listened to constituents who tell me their biggest problem, in particular, is the price of gas. It seems to me the world's most deliberative body should never stop deliberation on what is the crisis of the day. The Senator from New Hampshire made a tremendous speech that was right on point. We may have our differences one way or another on what to do but objecting to letting us debate those differences is not acceptable. For 25 years, the United States has encouraged consumption and discouraged production. It is time we encourage conservation and empower production, as we bridge our way from gasoline today as an energy source to the next energy source of the 21st century, whether it be the lithium battery, hydrogen engine or whatever. There is another crisis on our economy I wish to talk about for a second that is equally compelling and that is the housing industry and the tremendous stress our financial markets are under and our financial institutions. There have been a number of speeches made on the housing bill, which we will vote on tomorrow at 11 a.m., which, quite frankly, trouble me because they have not been on target. For a second, I would like to make a few points. There are a lot of people saying the housing bill we will pass is a bailout for the people who caused the problem. That is not correct. The people who caused the problem are off the radar screen; the investment bankers and Moody's and Standard and Poor's caused the subprime mortgage problem. Wall Street securitized the paper, and Moody's and Standard and Poor's rated it investment grade. It wasn't investment grade and should not have been packaged, but it was. They put out all over America--the originators and lenders--loans that didn't require documentation or a downpayment and that only cost a high yield on the mortgage to make it a nice instrument to sell. As the housing crises of 1968, 1974, and 1991 were predicated, in part or in whole, on easy credit and shoddy underwriting, so is the stress on our economy today based on that easy credit and shoddy underwriting generated by the subprime market. The bill we are doing tomorrow is not a bailout to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae or the institutions that made bad loans. It is an infusion of confidence the financial markets need. Fannie and Freddie suffer by perception from the difficulties of our mortgage market. If anybody would take the time to go look at default rates, for example, they would look at the loans Fannie Mae holds, and they are at 1.2 percent, well under what is considered a normal, good, healthy balance. The subprime market's defaults are in the 4- to 6- to 8-point range. That is causing that problem. That wasn't Fannie Mae paper, and it wasn't securitized by Fannie Mae. They have $50 billion in capital, when the requirement is to have $15 billion, so they are sound. But the financial markets, because of the collapse of the mortgage market, have gotten worse. I think Secretary Paulson has done the right thing. I commend Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby for the second key component of the bill. The Dodd-Shelby provision ensures that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will have regulatory oversight and be held accountable, as the banking system in our country is. What Paulson has done is said, in return for that, we will give to Freddie and Fannie what the American banking institutions have and that is access to the Treasury window for secured collateralized borrowing. You might say: What does all this mean? What it means is we will put liquidity back into the mortgage market. There will be good underwriting and accountable credit issued by mortgages that are then sold to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae to provide the liquidity in the marketplace. This is not a bailout for those two institutions. It is an insurance policy that the credit markets will understand that, A, those institutions are strong and the United States is going to hold them accountable and, B, provide them with liquidity when they need it. That is good for this country and this economy, and it would be a tragedy if tomorrow this Senate doesn't overwhelmingly embrace that legislation. The second component of the legislation is the reform of FHA, raising the loan limits and providing mechanisms also for troubled loans to be refinanced--not a gift as a bailout but providing a lender whose loan is in trouble because the house depreciated below the outstanding balance on the loan--it is going to be allowed to refinance on a fixed rate--an FHA underwritten loan the individual has to qualify for. If the lender takes the discount down, or takes the hit, that loan can be refinanced and that homeowner, instead of being foreclosed on and having a vacant house, ends up having a chance to pay for that mortgage and the economy is improved. What is happening today in America is the combination of a large number of foreclosures and no liquidity, as the housing market is off in many areas by as much as 50, 60 percent. Home values are declining at a rate of 15 percent per year this year and 11 percent last year. What has happened to American families' main source of spendable income--their equity line of credit--is that it has vanished. That is why the economy has gone into the tank. We had a housing/fuel boom in the 1990s and early 2000s, and now again we have a housing/fuel recession. The only difference between the boom and recession is, during the boom, we had liquidity, but underwriting got too shoddy. Now underwriting is strong, but the liquidity is not there. The FHA reform and Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae reform will, in fact, do that. There is a third feature I wish to talk about. It is a feature I introduced, originally, 6 months ago in the Senate. It is a housing tax credit for first-time home buyers to go into the marketplace and buy a house. The United States, in 1974, had a serious recession similar to the one we have today. It was fueled by an oversupply of unsold houses in the marketplace. A Democratic Congress and the Republican President, Gerald Ford, in 1975, passed a $2,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers who went and bought a standing vacant inventory house and occupied it as their home. That incentive brought Americans off the sidelines and into the marketplace, and we absorbed a tremendous amount of the standing inventory. Values came back in the United States and the housing market responded. The $8,000 tax credit--$4,000 a year for the first 2 years--on a home that a first-time home buyer buys and occupies is going to be a huge incentive to the housing market. It doesn't bail anybody out; it incentivizes a market to come back. When that happens, the problems go away. We cannot regulate ourselves, as a nation, into a strong economy. But we can incentivize our people and get confidence to the financial markets and restore what is a very shaky economy. I come to the Senate floor with the following message: I thank Senator Dodd and Shelby for all their work. I commend the House on what they did to make this housing bill a good bill. Again, I reassure everybody we are not bailing out anybody. What we are doing is incentivizing Americans to come back into the marketplace, providing them with good, accountable, credible credit, so there is liquidity in the housing market, and seeing to it that two institutions that ensure that Americans can be homeowners--Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae--are strong, and the investment markets have the confidence they need to have the support of the United States and, lastly, under the same type of transparency and accountability that the American banking system has been under since Alexander Hamilton. I yield the floor.","word.count":1368,"sep11":7.04775280898876,"years":2008.90730337079,"days":4951,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.531261526991917,"Topic 2":0.0738246950817607,"Topic 3":0.0326579587267164,"Topic 4":0.0986002309223641,"Topic 5":0.00929732369339188,"Topic 6":0.205337814509354,"Topic 7":0.00898658669632129,"Topic 8":0.0223391914259392,"Topic 9":0.0132898740186617,"Topic 10":0.00440479793357423},{"id":"10820040012564","body":"David Dreier: Mr. Speaker, Congress has consistently approved the eligibility of undocumented immigrants to receive emergency services, and I firmly believe that providing emergency health care is not inconsistent with curbing illegal immigration, which continues to be a high priority for me and others here.

And certainly, I have nothing but good things to say about the gentlewoman from New York , the minority ranking leader, my colleague. Small businesses are the driving force of our economy, and access to capital is the number one concern. The SBA has filled this void by providing various loans and other technical assistance programs needed to survive in today's competitive market. This legislation also takes into account the changing face of the business community and provides record funding levels over the next 3 years for core SBA programs. For example, the 7 loan guarantee program, which is SBA's primary business loan program, is increased to provide $1.3 billion more in loans. On Long Island, New York, this is extremely beneficial. Last year, SBA provided over $13 million in loans and other technical assistance to 86 small businesses in my district alone. The assistance provided to these businesses not only benefit them but the surrounding communities, as well. As small businesses prosper, so do the neighborhoods in which they operate. Studies show that small businesses are the leading source of innovative ideas. That is why it is important to foster their growth and provide them with the tools and skills they need to succeed in today's business world. Of particular importance to small businesses in my district is the need to take advantage of technology's role in the business sector. That is why I support funding increases for such incentives as small business development companies that help small businesses understand the role of e-commerce to compete in a technology driven economy. In addition, I also support the Women's Business Center Program.","word.count":325,"sep11":-2.57584269662921,"years":1999.28370786517,"days":1525,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.057918963977225,"Topic 2":0.426073112408766,"Topic 3":0.146724742808965,"Topic 4":0.00917007531754642,"Topic 5":0.0800364400415073,"Topic 6":0.231362525979983,"Topic 7":0.00647097511734114,"Topic 8":0.0229402672985657,"Topic 9":0.0128025675300552,"Topic 10":0.00650032952004503},{"id":"10519970045723","body":"Tom Daschle: Without objection, it is so ordered","word.count":1918,"sep11":-4.71067415730337,"years":1997.14887640449,"days":765,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.528691444944797,"Topic 2":0.150925030046359,"Topic 3":0.0431503667200543,"Topic 4":0.0140209507383384,"Topic 5":0.194231983149487,"Topic 6":0.0123379164765124,"Topic 7":0.00466954219361198,"Topic 8":0.0390050403608965,"Topic 9":0.00493800448167076,"Topic 10":0.00802972088827392},{"id":"10619990091118","body":"Charles Grassley: Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate immediately proceed to executive session to consider the following nominations on today's Executive Calendar: Nos. 59, 98, 99, 133, 203, 204, 244, 245, 246, 253, 254, 255, 256, 270, 275, 276, 277, 278, 279, 238, 239, 281 through 290, 293, 321, 322 through 325, 328, 330, 335 through 342, 344 through 365, 367 through 376, 378, 379, 380, 381, 382, 393, 395, 396, 397, 398, 402, 403, and all nominations on the Secretary's desk in the Foreign Service.

I will now conclude. I have given my word to fellow colleagues in the Senate that I would try to be out by 2 o'clock, and I will. I thank the Senate for its accommodation. Frankly, I appreciate this institution because it does provide a way for individuals who really feel strongly about this measure to be able to talk about it. We have a bill. The Senator from Wyoming pointed out that it was not the one laid on the desk, because we have changes so rapidly. But here is the bill. There it is. This bill represents a $868 billion tax increase on the backs of America's poorest working families; 60 percent--59.4 percent. Let me not exaggerate. The estimate is 59.4 percent of the $868 billion--59.4 percent of the $868 billion from this measure is to be paid for by people earning less than $30,000 a year. I believe we should reject it. This is a massive tax increase. This is a massive expansion of Government. This is an affront to the effort of families to provide for themselves. And I believe it is something that will be counterproductive. It invites all kinds of pernicious activity, including the black market, including the potential for increased drug utilization, including the loss of revenue to States when the black market emerges and no longer do those selling cigarettes pay even State taxes. But at the very bottom of it all, this is a $868 billion tax to be shouldered by the hard-working families who earn less than $30,000 a year. That is inappropriate and to me it is unacceptable. I do not believe any of the lofty pie-in-the-sky--supposedly supported by studies--objectives really justify it. We should pursue those objectives in ways that are more likely to be successful and less likely to be destructive of the capacity of hard-working families to survive.

LaTourette: Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to rise in support today of the Senate amendment to H.R. 802, the Maritime Prevention Pollution Act of 2008. I want to give credit and pay tribute to the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Oberstar, and the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Cummings of Maryland, for their diligence in working this bill and working the will of the committee and today the will of the House. I join Mr. Oberstar in expressing my regret that the other body has not acted in as prompt a fashion, and therefore we may be too late with this legislation. Hopefully that isn't the case. This type of legislation is exactly what our committee should be about. Those of us, as the current occupant of the chair who hails from the Great Lakes region, as does the chairman of the full committee, know the great work that has gone into the restoration of the Great Lakes over many, many years. I am reminded as I listened to the chairman talk about the action or inaction of the other body that Johnny Carson, before the restoration of Lake Erie in particular was in full swing, used to joke that Lake Erie was a place where fish went to die. I think it is appropriate to say that at this moment in time, the Senate, regardless of who is in charge, is a place where bills go to die. This bill will implement international requirements to reduce air emissions from ships for purposes of U.S. law and will establish more stringent standards for the emissions of airborne pollutants from ships as well as the sulfur content of fuel oil used in United States waters. As Members may remember, the House first passed this bill in March of 2007, again thanks to the splendid leadership of Chairman Oberstar and Chairman Cummings, with a broad bipartisan majority. Since that time, the bill has languished in the other body, to the point where we may well be prevented from voting on proposed amendments to the underlying convention at the next meeting of the International Maritime Organization. As a result, our abilities to push for strengthened measures have been significantly weakened. Nonetheless, this is important legislation. I am pleased we will be sending it to the President as a first step to improve environmental conditions in our ports and along our coasts. I urge all Members to join me in supporting this legislation. I reserve the balance of my time.","word.count":426,"sep11":7,"years":2008.8595505618,"days":4934,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.334646242719808,"Topic 2":0.219098735280738,"Topic 3":0.0131553221822272,"Topic 4":0.0134054488635927,"Topic 5":0.0105535106003133,"Topic 6":0.119234290286714,"Topic 7":0.0282287840491124,"Topic 8":0.0166601915777323,"Topic 9":0.240120563223351,"Topic 10":0.00489691121641222},{"id":"10920050070985","body":"Lindsey Graham: Mr. President, No. 1, I would like to recognize that Senator Stevens, who has so honorably served our country, is genuinely concerned about the extent of this amendment. For those of you who are listening, Senator Stevens was a World War II pilot. He has gone in harm's way in defending his country. We have in the Chamber his counterpart on the Appropriations Committee, Senator Inouye, a Medal of Honor winner, and the Senator occupying the chair is a former POW. The food chain is going down when I am speaking. But what I want to try to discuss today is from a lawyer's point of view and really from a citizen's point of view. I have had the honor for the last 20-some years to be a member of the Judge Advocate General's Corps of the Air Force, a prosecutor, a defense counsel, and I am now a Reserve military judge. That experience has been a wonderful experience. I have received more out of it than given. Wearing the uniform in any capacity is quite an honor, and to be a military lawyer has been one of the highlights of my life. I have never been shot at. I had some clients who probably wanted to kill me. But other than that, I do understand this debate pretty well. To me, it is not much of a debate. We have as a nation adopted the position that Senator McCain described when it comes to how you handle people in your care and custody. One thing I would respond to Senator Stevens is that the Army Field Manual has sort of been the bible for interrogation for decades. If you are worried, and I think it is a fair question, is there anything in the Army Field Manual that would unfairly restrict the ability of the United States to gain good information and defend ourselves from a bunch of rogue thug murderers, the answer is no. You don't have to trust me there. Go to Gitmo and ask the question of the people who are doing the interrogation of these terrorists: Is there anything in the Army Field Manual as written or being drafted that would impede your ability to gather good information? And the answer they told me was no. So what is the value of having it? The value of having standardization when it comes to interrogation, detention, and prosecution is of immeasurable benefit to the force because, as Senator McCain indicated, a lot of the people implementing these policies when it comes to interrogation, detention, and prosecution are in harm's way themselves. One of the things we have learned in this whole war on terror is that this Nation needs to have effective interrogation techniques, effective detention policies, and effective prosecution tools to hold the terrorists responsible because you have two audiences. No. 1, you have the terrorist community. I want every terrorist to know, if you are not killed on the battlefield and you are captured, things are going to happen to you. You are going to be interrogated aggressively, but we are going to treat you humanely, not because we worry about your sensitivities but because we don't want to become who we are interrogating. So we are going to keep that in place. The President has said whether the Geneva Convention applies or not we are going to treat everybody in our charge humanely, not because of them but because of us. And the debate here is what happens when somebody in your charge is not covered by the Geneva Conventions. It is easy when someone is a legal combatant. We know what the rules are. We have the Geneva Conventions. We have been a signatory for 60 years. The Army Field Manual covers that situation. The war on terror is different. Vietnam was different. We had people who were lawful, whom we were able to interrogate, detain, and prosecute without changing who we were. The Army Field Manual as a one-stop shop to guide the way we handle lawful combatants and enemy combatants is absolutely necessary if for no other reason than to protect our own troops. That is why we are doing this. That is one of the main reasons--to make sure that your own troops don't get in trouble because they are confused. I have been a military lawyer for 20 years. We have confused people about as much as you can possibly confuse them. And this all started with the Bybee memo. I think we need to know the history of where we have been, to find where we are before we take corrective action. Right after 9/11, this Nation was shocked and shaken. We tried to make sure we could secure our freedom and security and do a balancing act, and we have done a pretty good job of it. How can you be secure and still free? How can you fight the worst enemy and still not become the worst of yourself? I think you can. The Bybee memo was an effort by people at the Justice Department to take international torture statutes that we had ratified and been party of and have the most bizarre interpretation basically where anything goes. It was an effort on the part of the Department of Justice lawyers to stretch the law to the point the law meant nothing. And early on in this process, those in uniform who happened to be military lawyers stood up and spoke. I am going to read from General Sandkuhler, Brigadier General of the U.S. Marines, who was one of the judge advocates to review this change in policy, this very liberal interpretation of what torture might be. He said: The general is telling the civilians that we live in a different world. This is a complex process, and if we interpret a torture statute in the way you are suggesting, we are going to get our own people in trouble. He says: We have been the gold standard. We take this moral high ground to make sure if our people fall into enemy hands that we will have the moral force to say, You better treat them right. If you don't practice what you preach, nobody listens. Sometimes that does not happen, but you don't want to erode the principle because it puts people at risk. Criminal and Civil Liability of DOD Military and Civilian Personnel in Domestic, Foreign, and International Forums. All the reasons all the JAGs wanted to push back is that you are going too far if you interpret the statutes as being proposed by the Department of Justice. Some of the techniques violate the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Senator Stevens is concerned about joint operations. Here is the rule: If you are wearing America's uniform, you are going to be judged by American standards. You will never be prosecuted unless you do something inconsistent with our law. If you are part of an international group and wondering what to do with a prisoner in front of you, I suggest we let our troops know there are rules they must follow, and if they see anything they think is out of bounds, report it. The best thing we can do for anybody operating in the war on terror is give them clarity about what to do in very stressful situations. There is the combat role. What do you do with somebody who is captured? You do what the President says: You treat them humanely, you interrogate them by standards we can live by that will not erode our moral authority. Where have those standards been in the last 50 or 60 years? The Army Field Manual. You can change the Army Field Manual to adapt techniques to the war on terror. There is a classified section of the Army Field Manual. There is nothing about its adoption that limits the ability to aggressively interrogate people to get good intelligence. But if you want to torture people, the Army Field Manual says no and the President says no. It is now time for Congress to say no, and that is what this amendment is about. Congress has been AWOL when it comes to the war on terror in terms of interrogation, detention, and prosecution, and we have done it in a way that weakens our Nation. We are the strongest when all three branches are on the same sheet of music. It is important, if we are going to win this war on terror, not to give the moral high ground to your enemy and to have laws that every branch of Government understands and the people implementing these laws are not confused and they will not get in trouble by following what we have said. Congress has been AWOL. It is now time for Congress to step up to the plate and offer assistance in the war on terror to the administration. That is exactly what we are doing. I asked Judge Roberts, during the confirmation process, about this whole line of questioning. I said: It is an important international effort, and al-Qaida should not be considered a lawful combatant under Geneva Conventions. But it is about us, as Senator McCain said. When we catch someone who is not under the Geneva Conventions, it is important that our people not only follow the dictates of the President--treat them humanely--but they know what to do. We are giving confusing policies in this new war on terror, this hybrid between a lawful combatant, enemy combatant, and regular combatant. We need to standardize our techniques. How do we do that to make America the strongest? How can we effectively do that? We get the Congress involved, we get the administration involved, and we get the courts involved. Right now we have two court cases that are all over the board. Judges are telling us--Justice Scalia in one of the court cases is screaming out that Congress has been absent here. Congress needs to speak because the courts are not equipped to run Guantanamo Bay. The courts are not well equipped to interpret military policy, and they need guidance from Congress. I asked Justice Roberts about that. One of his favorite Justices is Justice Jackson. Justice Jackson in the Youngstown steel case basically said that the executive branch is at its strongest when it has the expressed or implied consent of Congress. When I met with Judge Roberts on this whole issue about detention, interrogation, and prosecution of enemy combatants, he said this is an area where the courts would welcome congressional involvement. As a result of us being AWOL in Congress, there is a Supreme Court decision, 5 to 4, giving enemy combatants at Guantanamo Bay habeas corpus rig","word.count":2859,"sep11":4.17134831460674,"years":2006.0308988764,"days":3927,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.8583086482173,"Topic 2":0.0409658240298788,"Topic 3":0.0109393129484246,"Topic 4":0.0189921149015138,"Topic 5":0.00948992193239205,"Topic 6":0.015708584763638,"Topic 7":0.00742055915812482,"Topic 8":0.0220064328104319,"Topic 9":0.0118524951416102,"Topic 10":0.00431610609668578},{"id":"10920050035738","body":"Phil Gingrey: Without objection, it is so ordered","word.count":421,"sep11":4.28651685393258,"years":2006.14606741573,"days":3968,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.899203467441826,"Topic 2":0.0334150491840295,"Topic 3":0.0070389016559119,"Topic 4":0.0167033723258719,"Topic 5":0.0070147812150345,"Topic 6":0.00778459917208204,"Topic 7":0.00551559672522165,"Topic 8":0.0128054110731618,"Topic 9":0.00746757090089866,"Topic 10":0.003051250305962},{"id":"10519970032390","body":"Sam Johnson: Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for his eloquent remarks in support of this resolution.","word.count":152,"sep11":-4.06741573033708,"years":1997.79213483146,"days":994,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.467527707587844,"Topic 2":0.306021575380723,"Topic 3":0.00673086049368983,"Topic 4":0.0847405848550892,"Topic 5":0.0118885889962198,"Topic 6":0.00399834487526487,"Topic 7":0.0745525926152696,"Topic 8":0.0300571593546158,"Topic 9":0.00895372762707572,"Topic 10":0.00552885821420818},{"id":"10419960023589","body":"Gerald B.H.

Mr. Speaker, this is a rule that is open, it is fair, it allows cutting amendments, it allows offsetting amendments, it allows limitation amendments, and there is no time limit on the bill itself. I have to forewarn the Members that after today there will be 29 legislative days left. That means that we have approximately 13 appropriation bills and their conference reports to deal with. We have three reconciliation bills that must be dealt with. We have the Safe Drinking Water Act. We have welfare reform. We have all of these issues that have to come to the floor. Each one of them, there are about 85 of them, are going to take the best part of a day. When you consider there are 29 days left and we have 85 major issues to deal with, a lot is going to get left by the boards, because it is imperative we get out of here by October 4 and go back home and be where we should be, with our constituents. So, having said that, let me just say that I hope that the Members, if they are going to offer amendments, will work together. We do not want to have duplicative amendments. If some of us are interested in cutting this particular program or adding to that program, we ought to work together so that we do not have 40 or 50 or 60 amendments. Let us keep it to as few as we can and still accomplish what we want to do. Having said that, let me just say to the gentleman from Ohio, Congressman Ralph Regula, and the gentleman from Illinois, Sid Yates, what a great job they have done. It is absolutely imperative that this Congress stay on the glidepath to a balanced budget. This is the second consecutive year that we are doing that, and we have 5 more years to go. Every year gets more difficult because the cuts come even deeper, but we must absolutely stay on that glidepath to a balanced budget. That is why today I am supporting this bill, because it is a part of that glidepath, it is $500 million less than last year, and the projection for next year is going to be even deeper cuts in this bill and all of the other appropriation bills that are coming down the line. So, I want to really commend Ralph Regula and Sid Yates, because their job was very, very difficult. We have very important issues in this Interior bill. They deal with our national parks, which are so important to the past and the future of this country, and to be able to develop this bill while still cutting the overall budget, I think is a great accomplishment. I want to commend them for it and hope that this rule and this bill is going to pass today so that we can get on and get to welfare reform and immigration reform and all of these other important bills that we have to deal with in the next 29 days.

The article describes the horrors of botulinum toxin, a potential weapon in Iraq's biological warfare arsenal. According to the Journal of the American Medical Association, botulinum toxin is the most poisonous substance known. We know that Saddam Hussein produced thousands of litres of botulinum toxin in the run up to the Gulf war. We also know where some of the toxin came from. Guess. The United States, which approved shipments of botulinum toxin from a nonprofit scientific specimen repository to the government of Iraq in l986 and l988. I recently asked Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld about these shipments during an Armed Services Committee hearing a week ago. I repeat today what I said to him then: In the event of a war with Iraq, might the United States be facing the possibility of reaping what it has sown? The threat of chemical and biological warfare is one of the most terrifying prospects of a war with Iraq, and it is one that should give us serious pause before we embark on a course of action that might lead to an all-out, no-holds-barred conflict. Earlier this week, British Prime Minister Tony Blair released an assessment of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program which contained the jolting conclusion that Iraq could launch chemical or biological warheads within 45 minutes of getting the green light from Saddam Hussein. The British government assessment, while putting Iraq's chemical and biological capabilities in starker terms than perhaps we have seen before, closely tracks with what U.S. officials have been warning for some time: namely, Saddam Hussein has the means and the know-how to wage biological and chemical warfare, and he has demonstrated his willingness to use such weapons. By the grace of God, he apparently has not yet achieved nuclear capability. On the matter of biological warfare, Gen. Richard Myers, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee last week that many improvements have been made to the protective gear worn by American soldiers and to the sensors used to detect chemical or biological agents. But according to the USA Today article on botulinum toxin, U.S. troops would be just as vulnerable to botulinum toxin today as they were during the Gulf war. This is what the article states: Last year's anthrax attack on the U.S. Senate gave all of us in this Chamber firsthand experience with biological warfare and new insight into the insidious nature of biological weapons. And that attack--hear me now--involved only about a teaspoon or so of anthrax sealed in an envelope. The potential consequences of a massive bioweapons attack against American soldiers on the battlefield boggle the imagination. My concerns over biological warfare were heightened last week when I came across a report in Newsweek that the U.S. Government had cleared numerous shipments of viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa to the Government of Iraq in the mid-1980s, at a time when the U.S. was cultivating Saddam Hussein as an ally against Iran. The shipments included anthrax and botulinum toxin. Moreover, during the same time period, the Centers for Disease Control, CDC, was also shipping deadly toxins to Iraq, including vials of West Nile fever virus and Dengue fever. This is not mere speculation. I have the letters from the CDC and the American Type Culture Collection laying out the dates of shipments, to whom they were sent, and what they included. This list is extensive and scary anthrax, botulinin toxin, and gas gangrene to name just a few. There were dozens and dozens of these pathogens shipped to various ministries within the Government of Iraq. Why does this matter today? Why do I care about something that happened nearly 20 years ago when Saddam Hussein was considered to be a potential ally and Iran's Ayatollah Khomeni was public enemy No. 1 in the United States? I care because it is relevant to today's debate on Iraq. This is not yesterday's news. This is tomorrow's news. Federal agencies have documents detailing exactly what biological material was shipped to Iraq from the United States. We have a paper trail. We not only know that Iraq has biological weapons, we know the type, the strain, and the batch number of the germs that may have been used to fashion those weapons. We know the dates they were shipped, and the addresses to which they were shipped. We have in our hands--now get this--the equivalent of a Betty Crocker cookbook of ingredients that the U.S. allowed Iraq to obtain and that may well have been used to concoct biological weapons. At last week's Armed Services Committee hearing, Secretary Rumsfeld said he has no knowledge of any such shipments, and doubted that they ever occurred. He seemed to be a little affronted at the very idea that the United States would ever countenance entering into such a deal with the devil. Secretary Rumsfeld should not shy away from this information. On the contrary, he should seek it out if he does not know it. Let's find out. No one is alleging that the United States deliberately sneaked biological weapons to Iraq under the table during the Iran-Iraq war. I am not suggesting that. I am confident that our Government is not that stupid. It was simply a matter of business as usual, I suppose. We freely exchange information and technology including scientific research with our friends. At the time, I suppose, Iraq was our friend. If there is any lesson to be learned from the Iraq experience, it is that we should choose our friends more carefully, see further down the road and exercise tighter controls on the export of materials that could be turned against us. Today's friend may be tomorrow's enemy. This is not the first time I have advocated stricter controls on exports. In fact, I added an amendment to the 1996 Defense Authorization Act that was specifically designed to curb the export of dual-use technology to potential adversaries of the United States. In the case of the biological materials shipped to Iraq, the Commerce Department and the CDC have lists of the shipments. The Defense Department ought to have the same lists so that the decisionmakers will know exactly what types of biological agents American soldiers may face in the field. Doesn't that make sense? Shouldn't the Defense Department know what is out there, so that the generals can know what counter- measures they might need to take to protect their troops? I believe the answer to those questions is yes, and so I am sending the information I have to Secretary Rumsfeld. He said he did not have any such information so I am going to send it to Secretary Rumsfeld. No matter how repugnant he finds the idea of the U.S. even inadvertently aiding Saddam Hussein in his quest to obtain biological weapons, the Secretary should have this information at hand, and should make sure that his field commanders also have it. The most deadly of the biological agents that came from the U.S. were shipped to the government of Iraq by the American Type Culture Collection, ATCC, a non-profit organization that provides biological materials to industry, government, and educational institutions around the world. According to its own records, the ATCC sent 11 separate shipments of biological materials to the government of Iraq between 1985 and 1988. The shipments included a witches brew of pathogens including anthrax, botulinum toxin, and gangrene. Meanwhile, the CDC was shipping toxic specimens to Iraq--including West Nile virus and dengue fever--from January 1980 until October 13, 1993. The nexus between the U.S.-approved shipments of pathogens and the development of Iraq's biological weapons program is particularly disturbing. Consider the following chain of events: In May of 1986, the ATCC reported the first shipments of anthrax and botulinum toxin to Iraq. A second shipment including anthrax and botulinum toxin was sent to Iraq in September of 1988. At approximately the same time that the first shipment was sent in April of 1986, Iraq turned from studying literature on biological warfare to experimenting with actual samples of anthrax and botulinum toxin. The turning point, according a report to the United Nations Security Council from the U.N. weapons inspection team, came when ``bacterial strains were received from overseas'' and delivered to an Iraqi biological weapons laboratory. In April of 1988, the U.N. weapons inspectors reported that Iraq began research on the biological agent Clostridium perfringens, more commonly known as gas gangrene. Clostridium perfringens cultures were among the materials shipped to Iraq by the ATCC in both 1986 and 1988. These are only a few examples of the pathogens that Iraq is known to have imported from the United States. It is not known how many of these materials were destroyed following the Persian Gulf war, or how many Iraq continues to possess, whether they are still viable, or whether in its pursuit of biological weapons, Iraq has developed ways to extend the shelf life of toxic biological agents. There is much that we do not know about Iraq's biological warfare program. But there are two important facts in which we can have great confidence: Iraq has biological weapons, and Iraq obtained biological materials from the United States in the 1980s. I asked Secretary Rumsfeld, at last week's Armed Services Committee hearing, whether we might be reaping what we have sown in Iraq, in terms of biological weapons. The question was rhetorical, but the link between shipments of biological material from the United States and the development of Iraq's biological weapons program is more than just an historical footnote.

Among the constructive purposes authorized in the bill are the hiring, training, and equipping of police and other law enforcement personnel and the establishment of crime prevention, early intervention, and drug court programs. The bill specifically contains prohibitions on buying things like tanks, airplanes, yachts, and limousines which could have been purchased under some of the former programs that the gentleman from Arkansas referenced. While I support the reauthorization contained in the bill, I had hoped that we would be looking at a program at the committee level along with other important law enforcement programs such as the Community Oriented Policing Services program, better known as the COPS program. The COPS program has been very successful and considered to be a vital contributor to the success of local communities in bringing down the crime rate all across the country. The gentleman from New York , a member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime introduced an authorization bill for the COPS program which had the support of the administration and a significant number of other Members of the House. I know that the law enforcement community which strongly supports the Weiner bill would have preferred to see both of these matters taken up in committee with both coming to the floor for an authorization based on a full assessment of their value to the local communities. Unfortunately, that did not happen and here we are with just this part of the bill. But before closing, Mr. Speaker, I would want to thank the gentleman from Arkansas for accommodating the concerns of the gentleman from Guam involving the formula for the appropriation. Inadvertently, the bill that we were to bring to the floor had an outdated allocation for Guam, but the bill before us now includes the updated allocation. Thanks to the alertness and effectiveness of the gentleman from Guam, we were able to correct this oversight. Mr. Speaker, although the bill does not contain the COPS program, I support the bill because it includes authorization for valuable, effective crime prevention initiatives which will be developed on the local level. I urge my colleagues to vote aye on the bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.","word.count":414,"sep11":-1.00280898876405,"years":2000.85674157303,"days":2085,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0728308024387436,"Topic 2":0.42829910246229,"Topic 3":0.0164756360719187,"Topic 4":0.0107254387176637,"Topic 5":0.403414645165339,"Topic 6":0.0158285457169195,"Topic 7":0.00664156670686023,"Topic 8":0.0242359299316107,"Topic 9":0.0109499524153424,"Topic 10":0.0105983803733111},{"id":"10619990014915","body":"Nita Lowey: Pursuant to clause 1 of rule XXI, all points of order are reserved on the bill.","word.count":116,"sep11":-2.32022471910112,"years":1999.5393258427,"days":1616,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0837320452211915,"Topic 2":0.0167850783939962,"Topic 3":0.0865913273415558,"Topic 4":0.0368591981471888,"Topic 5":0.0064074845037175,"Topic 6":0.682613199047329,"Topic 7":0.0147893690516038,"Topic 8":0.0637731974729137,"Topic 9":0.00637865506993182,"Topic 10":0.00207044575057189},{"id":"10620000008309","body":"Dick Armey: Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for yielding me the time, and I thank him for bringing this legislation to the floor. Mr. Speaker, we have heard a great deal today about people who are willing to work with us on the Tax Code and to fix the horrifying inequities that we find in the Tax Code that are so bothersome to the American people. I have been gratified to hear these expressions of commitment from both sides of the aisle, and I have been particularly gratified to hear the number of Democrats who have spoken so eloquently today for the need to avoid discriminatory taxation on the Internet. I must say, I certainly agree with them on that; and I am looking forward, then, to counting on their vote when we bring a moratorium on discriminatory taxation on the Internet to the floor later this year. But for the business at hand today, Mr. Speaker, we are again demonstrating to the American people that we are on the side of Mr. and Mrs. America. When they tell us that the extraordinary taxation and punitive provisions called the earnings limitation on senior citizens is unfair because it denies them the benefits they paid in all their lives, we agree. We passed the law, and the President signed it just last week. When we observe that we must eliminate the marriage penalty because it is unfair to tax people who want to get married, the American people have agreed. We passed it through the House. They will pass it through the Senate. And I am sure the President will sign that into law. And when we all agree, as we do, that it is unfair to tax people's estate when they die and, therefore, commit to eliminating the death tax because it is unfair to deny the children the legacy of their parents, I am sure we will pass that and it will be passed into law. Today we are saying, indeed, the entire Tax Code as we know it in America is today unfair because it drives the American people crazy with frustration and despair. Two hundred billion dollars, more man- hours than is spent on the production of every car, truck, and van produced in the United States, is devoted to just complying with this awful red tape nightmare called the Tax Code. The gentleman from Oklahoma says let us get rid of it, let us make a pledge, a commitment amongst ourselves today to be done with it, to scrap this Code, sunset this Code, have it out of our lives once and for all. I cannot tell my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, how near universal agreement there is among the American people with the need to do that. Ah, but the nay sayers arise, we cannot do that unless we know perfectly well today down to the last jot and tittle what will be in the next Code. There is no plan to replace this Code, they say, Mr. Speaker. Let me say there is a plan. There are at least three plans that I know of, all well-conceived, all very deeply well worked on, all very well publicized. It is not for me to describe all three, Mr. Speaker, but let me remind my colleagues about the first best plan to replace this awful nightmare. It is the flat tax, first conceived in 1984 by Professors Hall and Rabushka at the distinguished Hoover Institute in California, later revived in 1994 by myself. It does exist. It has been worked on in great detail. It has been examined, criticized, reexamined, refined. Mr. Speaker, for any of our colleagues that are unaware of this work, let me just say to my colleagues, while they have heretofore been given a free copy of my book The Flat Tax, should they have lost that or should it have been absconded with by one of their staff, let me remind them that today, even today, they can look it up on the Internet, flattax.house.gov, or even better, they could buy and read my book, in which case we could both profit.","word.count":691,"sep11":-1.44943820224719,"years":2000.41011235955,"days":1926,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0381500349319488,"Topic 2":0.0200374356845615,"Topic 3":0.00361812659181997,"Topic 4":0.0172498754430509,"Topic 5":0.00134687273111608,"Topic 6":0.00252249586562418,"Topic 7":0.525337499120026,"Topic 8":0.0069463062843877,"Topic 9":0.383129057885182,"Topic 10":0.00166229546228266},{"id":"10820030073028","body":"Pete Domenici: We will stay right on electricity in the morning and try to finish it as soon as we can.

I share Mrs. Morella's view that federal employees should be allowed to participate in the TSP immediately upon being hired. As Members of Congress, it is the least we can do to reward the hard work of our federal employees who, in recent years, have assumed increasing responsibilities, sacrificed higher private sector wages, and generally tried to make the federal government operate more efficiently with, in many cases, tighter budgets. This bill will help to ensure that the Federal government is able to keep pace with the private sector in attracting the best and brightest personnel. I have seen this trend first-hand in my district, where many talented individuals leave federal service because their government compensation and benefits just don't compete with offers in the private sector. I firmly believe that this bill seeks to level the playing field by enabling the federal government to hire and retain a highly skilled workforce that will secure the American public's confidence in our government and the services our federal workforce provides. By lifting the waiting period restrictions on TSP participation, this is just one more step to make federal employment more attractive to individuals, and more competitive with the private sector.","word.count":167,"sep11":-1.98314606741573,"years":1999.87640449438,"days":1736,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0554920885669779,"Topic 2":0.334453190392092,"Topic 3":0.0109474749192988,"Topic 4":0.00648686437080837,"Topic 5":0.0259127286326546,"Topic 6":0.199303718327086,"Topic 7":0.0142336883274459,"Topic 8":0.0190288199798414,"Topic 9":0.329317429178926,"Topic 10":0.00482399730486895},{"id":"11020080000066","body":"Phil Gingrey: I thank Dr. Burgess for yielding Mr. Speaker, the issue of medical liability reform is something that we've been talking about for a long time in this House of Representatives and in the other body, and it's time that we do something about it. I remember back in 2004, during the Presidential debate between our current President Bush and the Democratic nominee, Senator Kerry, and on one particular debate they were talking about the cost of medical malpractice insurance. And Senator Kerry made the statement that, well, you know, if a doctor has to pay $40,000, $50,000 a year, some can afford it; that's just a very small amount in the big scheme of things. And I thought President Bush did such a great job of responding to that and he said, you know, Senator, I believe you missed the point. Yeah, some doctors can afford to pay $50,000, some can afford to pay $75,000 a year, depending on their specialty, for medical malpractice coverage; other doctors can't. But that is really not the point. The point that causes the cost of medicine to go up so much is that all of these physicians practice in a defensive mode, and they order tests in many instances that are absolutely unnecessary, way too expensive, and, indeed, can be harmful to the patient. You know, I would imagine today, Mr. Speaker, if you went to any emergency room in this country with a headache, you are not going to get out of there without a CT scan being performed. And that particular procedure, by the time it is done and the radiologist reads the film, you're talking about $500, $600, when it would be obvious to a clinician, a skilled clinician in physical diagnosis that this patient is suffering from a tension headache or maybe a migraine headache. So this is where that cost goes up so much. I appreciate the gentleman giving me an opportunity to talk about it because the model for tort reform is what the State of California did back in 1978; the acronym is MICRA. But basically what we're talking about is to say that no patient who is injured by a physician practicing below the standard of care or a health care facility practicing below the standard of care that results in direct harm to the patient, they should have every opportunity for their day in court. Dr. Burgess and I probably have seen situations where we are pulling for the plaintiff because we know what happened in the particular setting and maybe in our community. But the judgments for so-called pain and suffering that can be up into the millions of dollars, which are totally unrelated to the degree of injury, is inappropriate. And that's basically what was passed in California and it has worked. The State of Texas, my State of Georgia, the State of Florida, several States have done this; but the vast majority of States are in situations where you don't see any neurosurgeons covering the emergency room. You see very few OB/GYN doctors staying in practice beyond the age of 50. They're all either getting out of the practice completely or they're going over to just a GYN practice. So I thank my colleague for bringing this issue up. And as I finish my remarks and yield back to the gentleman from Texas, I want to say, Mr. Speaker, that what happens so many times in what we do, we're constrained because of the cost. And we base cost on programs like Medicare part D, by this so-called static scoring that it cost too much money when so often programs like that have the potential to, in the long run, save money, but would get no credit for it. So we don't do things that we should be doing. Just like, as we were talking about earlier in the evening on electronic medical records, yes, it would cost some money, Mr. Speaker; the Federal Government would have to spend some money. I think that the new Democratic leadership has made a mistake in enacting these PAYGO rules which make it impossible in some instances to do things like the physician payment fix that Dr. Burgess is talking about, the repeal of the alternative minimum tax, which clearly was a mistake, an oversight 35 years ago when it wasn't indexed for inflation. And so now the Democratic leadership has put themselves in a position where we can't get things done because of those PAYGO rules when in the long run the program that we would enact would save money; it wouldn't cost money. So you would be paying for it doubly by cutting another program and raising taxes to pay for something that will eventually pay for itself. And, certainly, I think that's true with Medicare part D, and I absolutely believe it is true with the electronic medical records system that we need in this country, and I think it's true in regard to medical liability reform that Dr. Burgess is talking about. So I thank the gentleman for bringing that up, and I yield back.","word.count":855,"sep11":6.50842696629214,"years":2008.36797752809,"days":4759,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.008950193466802,"Topic 2":0.32535320026547,"Topic 3":0.114592206947328,"Topic 4":0.00455488956364727,"Topic 5":0.317263024055791,"Topic 6":0.0203417987619382,"Topic 7":0.0167203163054977,"Topic 8":0.046871013931547,"Topic 9":0.0109532853989711,"Topic 10":0.134400071303007},{"id":"10820040014593","body":"Joe Hoeffel: Mr. Speaker, I admire the fervor that my colleague from Washington has for pointing out the truth about the failings of Chalabi; but the point he just made is a lot more important, frankly, than the fun we are having piling on a guy like Chalabi, who is clearly a fraud, clearly a spinmeister, the kind of guy that my grandfather would have called a floor flusher. To meet Chalabi, as I did once, is to understand that the guy is just full of hot air. But the question that my colleague poses to us tonight and to the Congress is, why did other people in the administrations not figure this out? And why are those who made mistakes not being held accountable for those mistakes? Because it would be a great injustice if we were to allow anybody watching tonight to get the impression that the problems of our policies in Iraq were solely the fault of Chalabi giving us bad information.

Let me for a couple minutes speak to several issues before he determines whether or not he is going to object to this request. In the wake of September 11, a number of insurance companies are declining to provide coverage from losses which result from terrorist attack. At 2:30 today, I had a meeting in my office with a large number of real estate people in desperate need to have their projects go forward. They are not able to obtain antiterrorism insurance. I know it is a serious problem. We continue to hear from the General Accounting Office and others that those insurance policies that are available are priced so high that they are really not affordable, even though they may be available. It is unfortunate that last year before adjournment we heard objections to our unanimous consent request to take up H.R. 3210, the House terrorism bill, and amend it with a substitute offered by the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, and others. We believed that our effort to move forward was in good faith and addressed a present need. We found that some of our colleagues insisted on the consideration of amendments that made it difficult to complete the work on this issue, and it was not completed. Today, we are again seeking unanimous consent on Senator Dodd's proposal which provides the safety net needed to keep insuring against terrorist risks. In turn, that coverage would allow builders to keep building, businesses to keep growing, and hopefully prevent further economic setbacks. This amendment was a product of extensive bipartisan negotiations. It was developed with extensive consultation with a number of Senate Democrats and Republicans, including Senator Gramm of Texas, as well as the White House and the Treasury Department. While we were unable to reach agreement on every point, the proposal incorporated, line-by- line, suggestions by our colleagues from both sides of the aisle and this administration. It represented a compromise. It requires substantial payments by insurance companies before the Federal Government provides a backstop. The proposal would require the insurance industry to retain the responsibility to pay up to $10 billion in losses in the first year, and up to $15 billion in losses in the second year, or around 7 to 10 percent of the annual premiums for each affected company. This legislation would ensure stability in the insurance market so that businesses can afford to purchase insurance.

As the Republican manager for this legislation, I want to speak to an amendment which was offered Friday by the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold, but also to speak generally about the behavior of the bankruptcy bar as it relates to the amount of bankruptcies that are being filed, which were at a historical high of 1.4 million last year. That was a 30-percent increase. There was probably a 25-percent increase in 1996 over 1995. As we all know, there is an explosion of filings for consumer bankruptcy. I have blamed some of that on the law of 1978. That is why we have this bill before us, to change the law so it is not so easy to go into bankruptcy. In 20 years, I have had hundreds of people talk to me about it being too easy to go into bankruptcy. It ought to be harder, in their judgment. I have not had one person say to me that it ought to be easier to go into bankruptcy, and I have had people who have gone through bankruptcy tell me how easy it is to get into bankruptcy. I think the law of 1978 is at fault to some extent. I think the situation we have with Congress with 30 years of deficit spending, that Government doesn't have to live within its income, sends a signal to people in this country that it is all right for individuals to live beyond their income and avoid paying for it. We have had a general lack of shame or personal responsibility that used to be associated with paying bills or not paying bills and the filing of bankruptcy. That is no longer the situation, although that can be somewhat to blame for Government not setting a good example in this area. I also think there is more than just the downfall of personal responsibility. We have heard lots of speeches about how the credit industry, particularly the credit card industry, has not been very careful in the number of requests they have granted for bankruptcy, or the willy-nilly approach--I know they will say it is not willy-nilly. There is a very careful study they have of who ought to be mailed a credit card or not mailed a credit card. But as a practical matter, they have been pretty darn fluid with the number of credit cards that have been going through the mail. All of these are reasons why we have this legislation before us. All of these are reasons why this bill was voted out of committee on a vote of 16 to 2. All of these are reasons why a very strong bill passed the House of Representatives by a veto-proof margin. And all of these, I think, are reasons that, hopefully, on Tuesday or Wednesday of this week we will pass this bill by a very substantial margin. As I indicated, we have as one of the amendments that we will be voting on tomorrow an amendment offered by the Senator from Wisconsin. In my earlier statements on the Senate floor, I have alluded to the role of the overly aggressive bankruptcy lawyers plague in fomenting the current crisis in our bankruptcy system. Last Friday, Senator Feingold offered an amendment which will insulate bankruptcy lawyers from fines when they encourage bankruptcy abuse. As reported by the Judiciary Committee, the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act fines--in other words, penalizes--bankruptcy lawyers who steer high-income people who can repay their debt into chapter 7. Under the bill, in the narrow circumstance where a chapter 7 trustee is successful in getting a chapter 7 case dismissed or converted to chapter 13, the lawyer for high-income bankruptcy will be fined if his or her case is not substantially justified. That is our bill. This fine will reimburse the chapter 7 trustee for expenses incurred while detecting abuses of the bankruptcy system. I think any reasonable person will say that lawyers who file bankruptcy cases which are not substantially justified ought to be required and will be required to help defray the costs of these frivolous cases. That is all this bill does. Senator Feingold wants to cut this reasonable effort to control a bankruptcy bar which is seriously out of control. Mr. President, in order for my colleagues to understand the importance of imposing some reasonable controls on the conduct of bankruptcy lawyers, I want to give a little background on the conduct of bankruptcy lawyers. Today, many lawyers who specialize in bankruptcy view bankruptcy as an opportunity to make big money for themselves. This profit motive causes bankruptcy lawyers to promote bankruptcy as the only option even when a financially troubled client has an obvious ability to repay his or her debts. In other words, this profit motive creates a real conflict of interest where bankruptcy lawyers push people into bankruptcy who don't belong there simply because they want to make a quick buck. As one of the members of the National Bankruptcy Commission noted in the Commission's 1997 report, many who make their living off the bankruptcy process have forgotten that declaring bankruptcy should have a moral dimension. As I have already said, the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act contains reasonable penalties for lawyer misconduct. These penalties will cause lawyers to think twice before they willy-nilly cart their client off to bankruptcy court and pocket a nice profit. Bankruptcy lawyers get paid ahead of anybody else if there are assets or, obviously, they charge before they are going to help you. Some lawyers, in their rush to turn a profit, operate what are known as bankruptcy mills. These bankruptcy mills are nothing more than processing centers for bankruptcy. There is little or no investigation done as to whether an individual actually needs bankruptcy protection or whether or not a person is able to at least partially repay some of his debt. Recently, one of these bankruptcy attorneys from Texas was sanctioned in bankruptcy court. According to the court, this attorney had very little knowledge of bankruptcy law, but advertised extensively in the Yellow Pages and on television. Apparently, his advertising worked, because he filed about 100 new bankruptcy cases a month. Most of the work was done by legal assistants with very limited training. The court concluded that the attorney's services ``amount to little more than a large scale petition preparer service for which he receives an unreasonably high fee.'' The practices of these bankruptcy mills are so deceptive and sleazy that last year the Federal Trade Commission went so far--our Federal Trade Commission--as to issue a consumer alert warning consumers of misleading ads promising debt consolidation. Mr. President, I think there is a widespread recognition that bankruptcy lawyers are preying on unsophisticated consumers who need counseling and help in setting up a budget and who do not need to declare bankruptcy. Bankruptcy lawyers are the fuel which makes the engines of the bankruptcy mills run. It is not surprising that bankruptcy lawyers are leading the charge against this bankruptcy reform legislation. I want to point to some other evidence of lawyers playing a prime role in this effort to get people into bankruptcy and to avoid the payment of debt. We have previously heard complaints from some on the Senate floor about whether our bill does enough to protect child support and also to protect alimony during bankruptcy proceedings. I have already spoken to that topic on a previous occasion, but for now, I want to point out that some bankruptcy lawyers actually advertise that they can help deadbeat dads get out of their child support and other marital obligations. One bankruptcy lawyer has even written a book entitled, as you can see, ``Discharging Marital Obligations in Bankruptcy,'' by James P. Caher, Esquire. I think it is outrageous, Mr. President, that bankruptcy lawyers are helping deadbeats to cheat to force spouses out of alimony and to cheat children out of child support. That is a recipe for promoting poverty and human misery. Those who want to help the collection of child support during bankruptcy proceedings should join me in rejecting the Feingold amendment to protect bankruptcy lawyers. Those who are concerned about protecting child support should join me to ensure lawyers who engage in predatory conduct are subject to stiff fines. Those who are concerned about protecting child support should join me in moving child support from No. 7 in the bankruptcy priority list to No. 1. This is the only way to get people's attention. This is the only way to restore professionalism to the bankruptcy bar. Let me tell you, Mr. President, how far these practices have gone. First, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article from the Consumer Bankruptcy News dated June 18 of this year. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:","word.count":225,"sep11":-3.98876404494382,"years":1997.87078651685,"days":1022,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0628202502426994,"Topic 2":0.167905079361863,"Topic 3":0.0139293280226177,"Topic 4":0.351776687627775,"Topic 5":0.00449826155869281,"Topic 6":0.00645435232281341,"Topic 7":0.372137208885741,"Topic 8":0.00132340459261313,"Topic 9":0.0161237377311301,"Topic 10":0.00303168965405345},{"id":"10519980027346","body":"Tom DeLay: Mr. Speaker, I probably will not take the entire 5 minutes, for those who are waiting to speak.

It reflects the bipartisan yearning and desire of the people of this country, and particularly of our State. Most people understand that Florida has a higher percentage of those over age 65 than the rest of the country. That is true. But wherever you are, age 65 and older, there are seniors who are facing choices in the year 2002 that seniors should not have to face. The choice that many seniors have to face is: Do I buy groceries or do I buy medicine? It is unimaginable to me that in this land of plenty, in this time of abundance, in this land of beneficence, in this land of great generosity, that we have among us, the generation that we owe so much to, our seniors, the generation that has built the strong economy upon which all now enjoy, the generation that has reestablished and secured the freedoms with which each of us participate in each day and sometimes takes for granted, it is unimaginable to me in the year 2002 that of that great generation there are those who would have to make a choice--because they cannot afford it--between buying groceries to eat and the medicine they need on a daily basis. Why are we trying to do what we are trying to do? It is because Medicare was set up 37 years ago when health care was centered around acute care in hospitals. If Medicare had not been set up in 1965, but instead, if we were designing a system which would take care of senior citizens by designing a health insurance plan funded by the Federal Government for senior citizens, would we include prescription drugs? The answer is, obviously, yes, because prescription drugs are so much a part of our health care today, so much a part of our quality of life, so much a part of the miracles of modern medicine that give us a greater quality of life. So if that is how we would design it, and yet it was designed 37 years ago, should we not modernize that system? The answer to that is, obviously, yes. Then it comes to a question of cost. And if the cost is such that we cannot get through this Senate because we have to operate with 60 out of 100 votes in order to pass anything, and we got to 52 votes with Senator Graham's and Senator Miller's amendment--that was a much more comprehensive plan than trying to find a plan that we can fashion, that we can get 60 votes to get it through this Chamber, this is what we have come up with. Some would say it has two prongs, but it really has three. There is the one that would take care of the most poor; i.e., it would take care of those up to 200 percent of the poverty level. They would have a fully funded Medicare prescription drug benefit. It would also take care of those the most sick. It would take care of the most poor and the most sick, the most sick being those stricken by a catastrophe, who have to spend a lot of money out of pocket. When they get to a certain level, a level in excess of $3,000 out of pocket, the Federal Government is going to take care of that, and, indeed, you are going to be able to buy that protection for $25 a year. That is called catastrophic coverage, and that is a pretty good deal. There is a third element, or prong, to this amendment. Those who would detract from this amendment would say it doesn't take care of the middle class. It certainly doesn't take care of the middle class as much as the original amendment offered by Senators Graham and Miller, but of course that costs a lot of money. What does this do for the middle class besides the catastrophic coverage for $25? It has a system in place that will have discounts up to 30 percent of the cost of those drugs, through a system designed to use bulk buying, plus an additional 5-percent reduction by virtue of a Federal subsidy. So it takes care of the most needy--that is, the poorest--by taking care of those with incomes up to 200 percent of the poverty level. It takes care of the most sick--when we have a catastrophic illness--for $25 a year, for anything out of pocket over something just in excess of $3,000 per year it takes care of that. And for everybody else it clearly reduces the price, up to 30 percent plus another 5-percent subsidy. That is not everything we want. That is not a total across-the-board prescription drug benefit under Medicare. But it is clearly a step in the right direction so we go about doing what we need to be doing: Modernizing Medicare that was set up 37 years ago. That is why I rise to add my voice to the support for this amendment and encourage its adoption. I yield the floor.","word.count":865,"sep11":0.904494382022472,"years":2002.76404494382,"days":2764,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0333297359945259,"Topic 2":0.11852051602435,"Topic 3":0.122728943908899,"Topic 4":0.180355395235087,"Topic 5":0.107462661733362,"Topic 6":0.0501292487628445,"Topic 7":0.0189459705172362,"Topic 8":0.246489021187014,"Topic 9":0.0931502311872209,"Topic 10":0.0288882754494598},{"id":"10720020027166","body":"Julia Carson: Mr. Speaker, let's get this straight: a preemptive war is a war nonetheless, a war the would-be preemptor starts. According to our Congressional Budget Office, the aggressive war the President wants to start against Iraq would cost our taxpayers between $6 and $9 billion a month. With most people's retirement accounts in the tank, the Federal accounts drenched in red ink and so many people out of work, don't we have better and less violently fatal ways to spend money? Despite our using parts of Iraq for bombing practice over a ten year period, Iraq hasn't attacked us. But if we carried out a campaign to destroy the regime entirely, what would Saddam have to lose by trying to sneak biological weapons into the U.S.? As we have seen in Afghanistan, it is not physically possible for us to bottle up a country so that no one can slip away. A preemptive strike without U.N. Security Council compliance is, by definition, aggression and a treaty violation. A duly entered into treaty is the law of the land. Moreover, the mandate of our Constitution is that Congress alone has the authority to start a war. And the Constitution does not permit Congress to delegate any part of that authority to the President as this proposed resolution would do. In discussing that Constitutional provision , Congressman Abraham Lincoln wrote in part: There are twenty million people in Iraq not named Hussein. An invasion would kill untold thousands of those already weakened people. On Saturday the President said, ``We must do everything we can to disarm this man before he hurts one single American.'' Could that possibly mean that the President believes the American soldiers who would be slaughtered in the war he wants to start against Iraq would not be ``hurt.'' Should such stark horror be so casually inflicted on so many young Americans on such flimsy and dubious evidence? Let's get another thing straight: the al-Qaida did not invent terrorism; it is anything but ``a new kind of war.'' It went on during the reconstruction period in America and periodically since. Not long ago, President Reagan and Vice-President Bush were telling us one of the good things about their then-friend Hussein was that he was secular and not a religious fanatic. Now suddenly this President Bush is telling us that Hussein is in cahoots with religious fanatics who, even the most casual student of the mideast knows, hate Hussein's guts and would be delighted to overthrow him. Bear in mind that the Bush/Hussein friendship was still going strong after both the Hussein invasion of Iran and his use of gas weapons against his own people. For 40 years, the Soviet Union was our adversary and was armed to the teeth with awesome nuclear weapons with intercontinental capability that made Hussein the pipsqueak he is. The Soviet Union also slaughtered millions of its own people and invaded neighboring countries. The Soviets were our Saddam Hussein of the time. But no U.S. ``preemptive war.'' Not necessary because the Soviets knew use of nuclear weapons would mean their suicide. For the sake of argument, let's say Hussein had primitive nuclear weapons now, which he almost certainly does not. He and his gang aren't so dumb that they don't know use of such weapons would mean that he and his ``grizzly gang'' would be vaporized within minutes by our awesome nuclear capability. So why war now? Mr. Rove, the White House politics man, is on record as saying that war is good for his party to win elections. Is this, then, a political question or a moral one? One of the greatest dangers to an American soldier is a poor economy at election time. In good conscience, I cannot cast my constituents' vote for this latter-day Gulf of Tonkin Resolution. It is said that the only thing we learn from history is that we do not learn from history.","word.count":654,"sep11":1.10393258426966,"years":2002.96348314607,"days":2835,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0372166122118326,"Topic 2":0.227435954329896,"Topic 3":0.0081685200396551,"Topic 4":0.0366210574600124,"Topic 5":0.0150226567041741,"Topic 6":0.011943357893686,"Topic 7":0.00433110222300399,"Topic 8":0.020530578740577,"Topic 9":0.0133580938611082,"Topic 10":0.625372066536055},{"id":"10619990007710","body":"Charles Norwood: Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the leaders of the Armenian Caucus for bringing us together to honor the memory of a tragedy, not just in Armenian history, but a tragedy in world history, a tragedy that holds for us an important historical lesson and one that should be acknowledged. As discussed, it was 85 years ago that the Ottoman Empire set out on a deliberate campaign to exterminate the Armenian people. Over a period of years, between 1915 and 1923, as they went house to house, village to village, they massacred men, women, and children, a total of 1.5 million, and a half million deported from their homelands to escape their terror. At the end of these 8 years, the Armenian population in certain areas in Turkey, in Anatolia, in Western Armenia, that population was virtually eliminated. At the time, as we have heard from our colleagues, Henry Morgantheau, the U.S. ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, depicted the Turkish order for deportations as a death warrant to a whole race. Our ambassador recognized that this was ethnic cleansing. It is unfortunate that the Turkish government to this day does not recognize that this was ethnic cleansing. Let me just say that willful ignorance of the lessons of history doom people to repeat those same actions again and again. We have also heard from our colleagues tonight how Adolph Hitler learned that same lesson, as he said, who remembers the Armenian genocide? Well, it is important for us to remember these genocides. It is important that we learn the lesson from this 85-year-old tragedy. In my home State of California, the State Board of Education has incorporated the story of the Armenian genocide in the social studies curriculum, and this is the right thing to do. I am a cosponsor of House Resolution 398, which calls upon the President of the United States to provide for appropriate training and materials on the Armenian genocide to all foreign service officers and all State Department officials. Why is this important? Because we want them to better understand genocide wherever it threatens to erupt. We want them to understand the nature and origins of genocide. We want them to help raise the world's public opinion against genocide, wherever it starts to foment. By recognizing and learning about the crime against humanity, specifically about the Armenian genocide, we can begin to honor the courage of its victims and commemorate the strides made by its survivors and hope that others will not have to go down the track following the experiences that were suffered by the people of Armenia, only to be followed by the Jewish genocide and other genocides that we have seen, such as the one going on in Southern Sudan today. So, again, let me commemorate and let me thank the Armenian Caucus for bringing this issue to us on this anniversary of that genocide.","word.count":767,"sep11":-2.47191011235955,"years":1999.38764044944,"days":1562,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0538566271638078,"Topic 2":0.590069043928857,"Topic 3":0.00563429755898768,"Topic 4":0.0911330604704481,"Topic 5":0.00711823757734865,"Topic 6":0.0031728978041287,"Topic 7":0.165463126709596,"Topic 8":0.00496841673344837,"Topic 9":0.0745991584717384,"Topic 10":0.00398513358163995},{"id":"10820030036056","body":"Christopher Smith: Mr. Speaker, most Americans now realize that Big Media, network TV news programs and the largest newspapers and news magazines, tried to determine the outcome of the Presidential election.

That bill is a good bill. It was reported out of the Senate Appropriations Committee on yesterday by a vote of 29 to 0. It had unanimous support in the reporting of it on yesterday. That unanimous vote could not have been possible without the cooperation and support and leadership of the distinguished Senator from Alaska and the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Ted Stevens. The committee held extensive hearings, and the Senator from Alaska and I joined in issuing the request for witnesses. Every witness that came before the committee had been agreed upon jointly by the Senator from Alaska and myself. Those hearings were important, they were productive, and they brought forth exceedingly valuable information to the members of the committee. And that information is reflected in the makeup of the appropriations bill. We had the local responders, the firemen, the police, the emergency health employees. We had seven Cabinet officers from the administration, and we also had the Director of FEMA. We had mayors. We had Governors. I was pleased with the hearings. I am very grateful and appreciative of the efforts that were made by Senator Stevens and the Members on both sides of the aisle. The hearings were very well attended. So it is a good bill. The war on terrorism proceeds. The Congress is receiving top secret briefings from the Secretary of Defense and the FBI Director almost weekly. The country is on a heightened state of alert. On March 21, 2002, the President submitted a supplemental budget request to prosecute that war. The principal components of the President's budget request included $14 billion for the Department of Defense; $5.3 billion for homeland defense, including $4.4 billion for the recently established Transportation Security Administration, $5.5 billion for New York in response to the September 11 attacks, $1.6 billion for international emergencies. This supplemental bill provides for those emergencies, as requested by the President. Just today, President Bush said, ``We've still got threats to the homeland that we've got to deal with, and it's very important for us not to hamper our ability to wage that war. . . .'' That is exactly what the supplemental appropriations deals with-- homeland security. The supplemental bill includes $8.35 billion for homeland defense, and increase of $3 billion over the budget request. This $3 billion focuses on problems that were identified during our homeland defense hearings. Our committee held very extensive hearings. We heard from the first responders, the state and local law enforcement personnel, the fire and medical personnel, individuals representing the ports, and those who had concerns about cyber security and the security of our nuclear weapons facilities and nuclear labs. We heard from those who are concerned about border security, airport security, food and agricultural safety, nuclear non-proliferation programs, and the vulnerability of our water systems. We heard from seven cabinet secretaries and the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. All of this information led us to formulate a supplemental appropriations bill which cleared the Senate Appropriations Committee by a recorded vote of twenty-nine to zero. Highlights include: $1.0 billion, $646 million above the request for first responder programs such as firefighting grants, State and local law enforcement grants, grants to State and local governments to fix the interoperability problem between State and local police, fire and medical personnel, emergency planning grants, funds to increase the number of FEMA search and rescue teams that have the training and equipment to combat biological, chemical and nuclear attacks and funds to make sure that we have standards for interoperable equipment; $970 million, $716 million above the request for port security including grants to improve security at ports, for increased Coast Guard surveillance, for increased Customs funding to improve container inspections overseas and to improve our technology on inspecting containers; $387 million of unrequested funds for bioterrorism, including funds to improve our toxicology and infectious disease lab capacity at the Centers for Disease Control; $200 million, $174 million above the request for security at our nuclear weapons facilities and nuclear labs; $154 million, $135 million above the request for cyber security, with a special emphasis on helping the private sector defend itself from attack; $125 million, $84 million above the request for border security, including resources for INS facilities on the borders and for deploying the system for rapid response criminal background checks to 30 more ports; $100 million of unrequested funds for nuclear nonproliferation programs; $265 million of unrequested funds for airport security, including $100 million to help airports meet the new Federal standards for airport security; $200 million for USDA for food safety labs, additional food inspectors, and for vulnerability assessments for rural water systems; $100 million for EPA to complete vulnerability assessments on the security of our water systems; and $286 million is provided for other homeland defense items such as Secret Service efforts to combat electronic crime, FBI counterterrorism efforts and funds for the Justice Department to develop an integrated information system. The bill fully funds the President's $4.4 billion request for the new Transportation Security Administration, unlike the House which cuts the request by $550 million. Just within the past few days, Vice President Cheney warned that a terrorist strike within our shores is ``almost certain.'' Defense Secretary Rumsfeld stated that it is inevitable that terrorists will acquire weapons of mass destruction. Secretary of State Colin Powell warned that ``terrorists are trying every way they can'' to get nuclear, chemical or biological weapons. Security has been tightened around New York City landmarks. And Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge said that, ``While we prepare for another terrorist attack, we need to understand that it is not a question of if, but a question of when.'' The warnings are clear. The danger is real. We should act, not delay. We should protect lives, not play politics. I urge Senators to move forward with this supplemental bill and to do so quickly. I yield the floor.","word.count":1019,"sep11":0.713483146067416,"years":2002.57303370787,"days":2696,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0472794702815441,"Topic 2":0.481361444559105,"Topic 3":0.0196101694021835,"Topic 4":0.00658739777316693,"Topic 5":0.0715216934120673,"Topic 6":0.00613095364818556,"Topic 7":0.00303600665908241,"Topic 8":0.350157980175877,"Topic 9":0.00754196614829783,"Topic 10":0.00677291794049066},{"id":"10820040061815","body":"Pete Domenici: Mr. President, I would like to announce for the information of the Senate and the public that a nomination hearing has been scheduled before the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.

I am going to support this package. I support our troops. I applaud their efforts. I am a strong proponent of fiscal responsibility, and I understand and recognize the tough choices that needed to be made in order to put this supplemental together. But with that said, a large component of this package is disaster assistance. When it comes to helping our fellow Americans through a crisis, we need to assist all with equal zeal. The fact is, while this bill offers some Americans a helping hand, it gives some others a cold shoulder. While this bill provides needed funding for agricultural disaster assistance in the gulf to producers affected by the hurricanes, it will not send a dime to Minnesota's farmers struggling to survive their own natural disaster. The Senate bill contained that helping hand. Chairman Cochran fought for--and has fought a number of times, by the way. And I thank the chairman for all the work he has done and all the work he has done on the supplemental and I certainly thank him for his sensitivity to the needs of Minnesota producers. I served with him when he was chairman of the Agriculture Committee before he became chairman of the Appropriations Committee. But this relief never made it through the conference. It is not in the final bill. I find it incomprehensible, if not irresponsible, to provide weather- related disaster assistance for one region of the country while withholding it from another. At its core, this is an issue about equity for all regions that are suffering. And to the thousands of Minnesotans whose very livelihood has been jeopardized and those losing their farms due to last year's disastrous weather, this bill is nothing short of cruel. The absence of this piece in the bill is nothing short of cruel. The images from Minnesota in 2005 speak volumes, surreal images of a mounting storm that almost defies description. Once unleashed, these ominous clouds transformed into tornadoes and a devastating downpour. Imagine looking out your living room window and seeing the shadow of this storm, as shown in this picture, cast on a farm you have worked all your life to build--a farm you have seen through good times and bad, from performing chores before school as a kid to managing the cash flow of a modern farming operation as an adult. These clouds must have brought great anxiety in their path. But these families would not have to wait long to find out what this storm would bring as they sought shelter from the tornadoes and from the high winds as they found cover from the 15 inches of rain that fell in 1 single day. When the sky cleared, this is the scene, as shown in this picture, victims of the storm found. These are the fields, carefully cultivated every year, that were the lifeblood of family farms. These fields, left in utter destruction, a source of great pride when covered by a healthy crop, became a source of great concern to producers who understood all too well that no amount of hard work and careful planning would undue the damage done to their fields. For many farmers, their worst fears were confirmed. In the sugar sector alone, revenue was reduced by $60 million in Minnesota in 2005, thanks to this natural disaster. In one county, crop loss exceeded $52 million and farmers were prevented from planting over 90,000 acres, thanks to saturated fields. Yet the real story cannot be told through statistics. I have met these farmers, and I have listened to their personal trials endured as a result of this catastrophic weather. I was up in Lake Bronson, MN, up in the northwest part of the State, Kittson County. I think the town has about 180 people. I was there on some other matters. In a town of about 180 people, farmers came from surrounding areas. One hundred farmers showed up to talk about what they have been through, to ask for my help in trying to protect this disaster assistance relief. I looked at the faces of these men and women who are hard working-- you could just kind of see that strength in their hands and in their faces--and I turned to one of my staff and said: This is why America won Two World Wars. These are people who have been there for our country time and again. And they were hurting. Farmers are losing their operations, pure and simple. Some of these producers will not be coming back to the fields next year thanks to this storm. They are not just losing a business, many are also losing a family tradition. America is losing something here. Thousands of farmers are struggling to figure out how they will make their cash flow work this year. It is easy for us to talk about terrible crop loss numbers in black and white figures on a page, but these numbers do not quite sum up the weight felt by the farmer who is anxiously wringing his ball cap in his hands as he surveys a barren field and wonders how he will convince the bank to give him one more season. It may shock many Americans to learn these images behind me are not from the gulf but, instead, that they describe the natural disaster that struck northern Minnesota in the spring of 2005. Even more shocking to Americans might be the fact that, of the millions of dollars in agriculture disaster aid in this emergency supplemental, none will go to these Minnesota farmers. I traveled to the gulf so see the hurricane damage firsthand in order to fully understand what my fellow Americans who live far from my Minnesota home are suffering, and I have supported their cause in Congress. I do not know that any of my colleagues from the gulf have ventured to my part of the world to witness the dire situation going on in places like Kittson County--and, again, in size and scope what happened in the gulf is almost incomprehensible--but I urge us not to forget what is happening in other parts of the country. For the farmers impacted, this is their life, this is what they got. It is underwater. I invite my fellow Senators who are interested in meeting these farmers to come to Minnesota. And not just to Minnesota; I think this same scene would be replayed in North Dakota and South Dakota and probably replayed in Missouri and other parts of the country. It is true that the suffering in the gulf is great. I have seen the tremendous damage, and I am committed to helping. But the burden experienced by the farmers I met in places such as Lake Bronson, MN, is also great. Congress should come to the aid of all Americans who find themselves victim of natural disaster and are left in financial peril and economic hardship too great for them to resolve on their own. This is simply a matter of fairness. The agricultural disaster aid package that was included in the Senate version of this emergency supplemental appropriations bill--of which I coauthored that piece--was fair. It provided assistance to farmers afflicted by natural disasters regardless of region or the type of natural disaster. This is a simple matter of fairness. What this conference report does is divide the Nation. If not excluded for regional reasons, then I suppose we are left with the conclusion that hurricanes are the only true natural disasters that deserve congressional attention. We all know that is false. And taxpayers know better. They deserve better. The fact this conference report does not provide one dollar for Minnesota's farmers is a true injustice. I will vote in favor of this emergency supplemental bill because it provides critical funding for our troops. That is what it is about. I am going to be there for that. But I will come to the floor again and again and again to raise the issue of disaster assistance for Minnesota farmers and others in the region. And at every turn I will work to move this funding. I will not let this inequity stand. Mr. President, I yield the floor.","word.count":134,"sep11":3.69662921348315,"years":2005.55617977528,"days":3758,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0615911428724176,"Topic 2":0.396139265782513,"Topic 3":0.0687306416726564,"Topic 4":0.187685940746139,"Topic 5":0.125884653370546,"Topic 6":0.0142642994520628,"Topic 7":0.0102592179655281,"Topic 8":0.0927714788294635,"Topic 9":0.0170908472895292,"Topic 10":0.0255825120191442},{"id":"10419950126908","body":"Barbara Boxer: Mr. President, if I may reclaim my time, because I have limited time, that is exactly what this debate is about. When my friend speaks, he can say what he thinks it is about. It is about taking a product that is frozen to one degree--what human being can say that one degree is not frozen-- and enabling producers to mark it ``fresh.'' Why? Because they want to get more money for a frozen product. That is what this is all about. They want to get more money by marking it ``fresh.'' So I would have shown you this chicken, hard as a rock, marked ``fresh.'' My friends objected, and I respect their right to object. So I will show you a picture instead. I know they cannot object to that. As you can see, there is a frozen chicken being used as a bowling ball headed for these pins and, as a result, I think some of them were knocked down. Now, do we believe for a minute that a chicken that is frozen like this should be marked ``fresh'' if it can knock down bowling pins? Now, if I told you this desk was a chair, you would think I was kidding. And if I told you summer was winter, and ice was hot, warm was freezing, ovens were freezers, and freezers were toasters, you would send me to the nearest psychiatrist. And you would be right. I do not know what came over the committee, but let me read you the definition of fresh. This is out of Webster's Dictionary: ``Fresh: Recently made, produced, or harvested, not preserved as by canning, smoking, or freezing.'' Yet, my friends on the committee say that if a chicken or a turkey is frozen to one degree, it can be marked fresh. Let me remind you what Webster said: ``. . . not preserved as by freezing.'' ``Frozen: Made into, or covered with, or surrounded by ice; preserved by freezing.'' That is frozen. ``Immobile.'' I will add one: It knocks down bowling pins. Chickens that are that hard are not fresh, they are frozen. And everyone with a pulse, I think, understands that. We have tried to straighten this mess out for 8 long years, and special interests come in every time and kill it. This time, the Clinton administration had the guts to issue this rule, and the Appropriations Committee--by the way, whose chairman said--and he is my friend, and I work with him and I admire him, and we just worked together on an issue--that we really should not do these things on appropriations bills, in relation to an article that appeared today.

It is a serious discussion. And really what we are trying to sort out here needs to be focused on for just one moment. There is, despite all of the stonewalling, despite all of the tardiness, slowness, failed memories, inability to find people, secrecy, there is ample evidence that one can read in the Nation's press, and there has been for some time ample evidence, even as it relates to millions of dollars of returned campaign contributions after the last election that were admittedly returned because they were subsequent to the elections discovered to have been illegal contributions. So that everybody in America must deal with a very serious question. And really we have two questions, one coming mostly from this side of the aisle, one coming from the other side of the aisle. We are saying that, given that people in highly elected office and positions of public trust must be honest and honorable beyond any shadow of a doubt and the interest of the security, national and domestic, of this Nation, that it is the Congress' responsibility to find out the truth about illegal activities, violations of law by people that are, in fact, in these highest positions of trust. The other side of the aisle, as we just heard just a moment ago, is arguing that there is some possibility that the system might have corrupted some people and, therefore, we must change the system and they are arguing that the more important and more immediate business is to get on with changing the system. I want to make a point here, Mr. Speaker, and I want to make it as emphatically as I can. When dealing with the choice of how do we prioritize the actions by the Congress of the United States relative to, one, the question of discerning the truth about the honesty, honor and integrity of people in highly elected offices, especially with respect to the manner in which they have acquired those offices; or, two, changing the rules of protocol and law that govern the financing of campaigns, that the latter must be clearly understood to be the matter of lesser priority. Stated another way, if this Congress is incapable of recognizing, if the press is incapable of recognizing, if the American people are incapable of recognizing, and if the White House is incapable of recognizing that all matters of doubt regarding the honesty, the integrity, the legality of people in the highest elected offices of this land is a matter of crucial and utmost concern that must be given priority over the manners in which the laws are written, that they will therefore then, having not addressed, as my colleagues equally feel, to continue violating as they violated the previous laws, then surely we are lost. There are serious questions related to the movement of money in campaigns, and no doubt we will address those in due time. But there can be no question of money that can be allowed to take precedence over questions of honesty, integrity, fidelity, duty and honor in those people that we would trust with dominion over the lives of our children's future.

Durbin: Mr. President, I thank Senator Leahy for allowing the creation of this new subcommittee in Judiciary that is known as Human Rights and the Law. It is the first time in the 218-year history of the Senate such a committee has been designated, and I am honored to serve as its chair. After our first hearing on genocide in Darfur, we decided it was time to close the legal loopholes that prevent the U.S. Justice Department from prosecuting people in our country who have committed genocide. This legislation is a result of our first hearing. We heard about these gaps in the law and found them hard to believe. Unlike the laws of torture, piracy, material support for terrorism, terrorism financing, hostage taking, and many other Federal crimes, laws related to genocide do not allow the arrest and prosecution in the United States of people who are not U.S. citizens, or who have not committed the act of genocide in our Nation. Of course, those are few and far between. There is no reason to treat genocide, perhaps the worst crime known to humanity, differently than any of these crimes. During the Human Rights Subcommittee's hearings, we heard from Romeo Dallaire. He is now a member of the Canadian Senate, and he was the general in charge of the U.N. peacekeeping force in Rwanda in 1994. He tried desperately to stop that genocide, and many people refused to even listen. Two notable exceptions were former colleagues in the Senate: my predecessor, Senator Paul Simon of Illinois, and a man whom I respect very much and recently retired, Senator Jim Jeffords of Vermont. They appealed to the Clinton administration to send troops into Rwanda--just a small force to stop the massacre--but sadly, the administration did not respond. President Clinton has said it was the worst mistake of his administration. His candor and honesty are appreciated, but we should learn from that mistake. Despite all of the world's solemn promises, today in Darfur, in western Sudan, another genocide rages. In a region of 6 million people, hundreds of thousands have been killed, and over 2 million people have been displaced. For them, the commitment of ``never again'' rings very hollow. Earlier this month, Sudan's President Omar Hassan al-Bashir sent a letter to the U.N. Secretary General rejecting the core elements of the plan to send U.N. peacekeepers to Darfur. Bashir claimed that U.N. and African peacekeeping forces have no authority to protect civilians in his country, saying Sudan bears the primary responsibility. Four years into the genocide, the claim that the Khartoum regime will protect civilians in Darfur is not only implausible, it is offensive. President Bashir has thumbed his nose at the international community. The question is: How will we respond, once having declared a genocide? Last week a U.N. human rights team reporting on Darfur called for U.N. Security Council intervention, tougher sanctions, and criminal prosecution of guilty parties. They also called for the international community's response to the genocide in Darfur immediately. The U.N. human rights team is led by Jody Williams, a genuine American hero who won the Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts to ban landmines. Upon completing her investigation of Darfur, Ms. Williams had a message for the international community. She said: Jody Williams is right. We have to do more than just talk about genocide in Darfur. Today, joined by Senator Sam Brownback, a Republican of Kansas, and 30 of my colleagues, I sent a letter to the President urging him to put the question of meaningful multilateral sanctions to a vote before the U.N. Security Council. We have been told in the past that one of the permanent members of this council may veto the resolution. I say: So be it. Let that nation stand up in front of the world and say they are going to veto this effort to stop this mass murder. We recognize there are political risks to advancing this strategy, but it is time to weigh those risks against the damage that is being done and the verdict of history. It is our moral obligation to do everything we can to stop this genocide in Darfur. Another important step is to make clear the commitment of the United States to hold accountable those who are guilty of this ultimate crime. It is hard to imagine that individuals in the Sudanese Government whom we have identified as being involved in genocide have come to the United States and have been treated as visiting dignitaries, and have traveled with impunity around our Nation. It is hard to imagine we would turn our back on the fact of what they have done in their own home country. I am pleased the International Criminal Court is moving forward with this investigation into the Darfur genocide, but that does not excuse the United States from its obligation to prosecute war criminals who seek safe haven or even travel in the United States. It is not just Darfur. The Justice Department has identified individuals who participated in the Rwandan and Bosnian genocides living now in the United States under false pretenses. How can we let the United States be a safe haven for those who are guilty of genocide around the world? The fact is the law is on their side. American law doesn't give us the authority to arrest and prosecute these individuals, and that is why I have introduced this legislation, to change the law and let them know they can no longer seek a safe haven in the United States. The Genocide Accountability Act says if you commit genocide anywhere in the world and come to the United States, America will hold you accountable under the law. This is the first legislation produced by the Human Rights Subcommittee. There will be more bills to follow. But I doubt the subcommittee or any other committee in Congress will face another issue as compelling as this genocide in Darfur. In 1862, 1 month before he signed the Emancipation Proclamation, President Abraham Lincoln sent a message to Congress proposing to end slavery. His words reach us even today when he said: Those words remain true. We here, even now, hold the power and bear the responsibility to do all we can to stop this genocide. Enacting the Genocide Accountability Act is an important step to ending impunity for perpetrators of genocide. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the letter which was sent to the President be printed in the Record. Mr. President, I yield the floor. There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:","word.count":1116,"sep11":5.6685393258427,"years":2007.52808988764,"days":4460,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.172115308045226,"Topic 2":0.183786826849974,"Topic 3":0.26878361249293,"Topic 4":0.0167616864583741,"Topic 5":0.0198447188507758,"Topic 6":0.0191654920659141,"Topic 7":0.00480391416481533,"Topic 8":0.287493768804294,"Topic 9":0.022873856304892,"Topic 10":0.00437081596280559},{"id":"10720020025904","body":"Spencer Bachus: Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr. Speaker, simply let me close by sort of reminiscing.

I'm delighted that we have the Dean of the Michigan delegation here, Congressman Fred Upton, who has been here through a lot and I'm sure has taken a lot of grief on this issue. And Congressman Upton, before I turn to you, let me just, for the record, state, as you and some of my longer serving Republican colleagues are chastised for not getting this done in the House, you have attempted to get it done on numerous occasions. If we look back at the last decade, by the numbers, votes on ANWR exploration: House Republicans, 91 percent support it; House Democrats, 86 percent opposed. Coal-to-liquid: House Republicans, 97 percent support it; House Democrats, 78 percent opposed. Oil shale exploration: House Republicans, 90 percent supported every vote on that in the House; House Democrats, 86 percent opposed. Moving to the Outer Continental Shelf exploration, where right now foreign countries like Japan, China and Mexico are within 44-50 miles of our shores, and they are drilling and taking out natural gas and oil. On these votes, House Republicans, 81 percent support it; House Democrats, 83 percent opposed. And then finally, refinery increased capacity, and now that we're offering the ``no-more-excuses'' Energy Act, the opportunity to put them on abandoned military facilities, government lands, House Republicans, 97 percent support it; House Democrats, 96 percent opposed. Who is willing to take action? Who has evidenced that by their votes in this great body, this House of Representatives? Republicans, 91 percent, when you put it all together, of House Republicans have historically voted to increase the production of American-made oil and gas while 86 percent of House Democrats have historically voted against increasing the production of American-made oil and gas. And so why do we see an ``energy-less'' energy bill that you talked about that gives incentives for bicycle riding and not energy? I think we have to say it's a leadership problem.

I have been listening to the debate over the past few days, and I think that a common theme on both sides of the aisle has been this is not a perfect bill. There are those on this side of the aisle who rightly say that this bill does not go as far as it could; that it doesn't focus enough of the assistance on low-income seniors and could do more to keep employers from reducing or eliminating benefits for their employees. Others have raised concerns about the fact that there is a $1,400 ``doughnut hole'' and an overly restrictive assets test that will mean less help for too many Americans. There are those on the other side of the aisle that have rightly said that this bill does not do enough to address the long-term solvency issues facing Medicare. They contend that this $400 billion expansion, without making additional structural reforms, puts Medicare on an unsure footing for the future. It is for these reasons that Members on both sides of the aisle have said they will vote against this bill. Many maxims have been used over the past few days to describe the choice before us. Some have said, ``A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.'' Others have said, ``Let us not make the perfect be the enemy of the good.'' Still others have said, ``Something is better than nothing.'' I have spent the last 25 years in public service, and if there is one thing I have learned, it is that a true compromise is one from which no one side walks away completely happy. If there is anyone who knows that lesson better than I, it is the senior Senator from Louisiana, Senator Breaux. I have often said that if there is a deal to be had, Senator Breaux will find it. He has an amazing talent for bringing two sides together in a way that preserves the key principles of both. I think he has succeeded in doing that again here. Going into the conference, Democrats insisted that the final bill must include the following: meaningful assistance to low income beneficiaries; providing Federal assistance to Medicare seniors on Medicaid, dual eligibles; strong Government fallbacks; and real incentives for employers to retain coverage. The conference agreement represents major victories in all four of these key areas. First, and perhaps most importantly, beneficiaries with low incomes will get immediate assistance in paying for their drugs. The premium, deductible and coverage gap would be waived for people earning up to $12,123 a year, $16,362 per couple. Those making up to $13,470, $18,180 per couple will not have to pay a premium or be subject to a coverage gap and would only have a $50 deductible. What this means in real terms is that one-third of all Medicare beneficiaries, over 200,000 of which are from my State, will get immediate assistance to drugs at little to no cost to themselves. These are people who today have no help. This bill also provides $88 billion in tax incentives to employers to encourage retaining existing retiree drug coverage. CBO estimates those incentives will greatly diminish the number of employers who will reduce or eliminate their coverage because of passage of this bill. It ensures that all beneficiaries will have access to drug coverage by providing a strong government fallback in the event that private plans do not provide adequate coverage in any particular region. Finally, it provides meaningful support to Medicare providers so that they can continue to care for our Nation's elderly. These are major victories. I am, however, disappointed by some of the provisions that were ultimately included in this bill, most especially the asset test. I understand that the asset test in this bill is fashioned after asset tests used to determine a person's eligibility for Social Security Income and Medicaid. I understand that it is, in fact, three times as generous as the asset tests used by those programs. Yet, in my view, further restricting eligibility for vital Government programs so as to separate out the near poor from the poor is a precedent that should be abolished, not furthered. I think the American public would be shocked to learn how restrictive these asset tests are. In this bill, if a senior whose income is less than $12,123 a year has more than $6,000 in assets, they will no longer qualify for assistance with their premiums or deductibles. The proponents of the asset test claim that they are necessary to ensure that a person doesn't claim to have an income of $12,123 and at the same time have a vacation home in Florida and $50,000 in stocks. But these are not the people that these asset tests affect. Who they end up affecting is a widow who is living on her husband's $600 a month Social Security check, but just so happens to have a $10,000 life insurance policy or home full of furniture valued at $3,000. That is just not fair. While I am not able to change this policy here, I do intent to work to change it later. Ten years have passed since this body was first presented with the need to reform Medicare. We have long recognized that the ways of medicine have changed. Medications and outpatient services have taken the place of intrusive surgeries and long-term hospitalization. We know that Medicare has not keep pace with those changes nor does it reflect the current needs of our seniors. Over the past 10 years, we have assembled task forces, engaged in numerous studies, held countless hearings and drafted several legislative proposals, but we have never gotten to where we are today, at the brink of passing a bill that will put us on the path of making reform a reality. I think we must act now. In a time of rising deficits, it is unlikely we will have $400 billion or the political will to make these improvements any time in the near future. The seniors in my State are tired of waiting for the perfect bill. If we do not pass this bill this year, who knows how much more time will pass before we get to this point. It certainly won't be next year. If we had not reduced our surpluses by giving out tax cuts, perhaps we could have done more, but there is no sense in wondering what could have been. What we need to focus on now is what can be. One year ago, I was in Louisiana running for re-election and I promised the people of Louisiana that while I would be with the President some of the time and I would be with the Democratic caucus some of the time, no matter what, I would be with the people of Louisiana 100 percent of the time. This bill is good for Louisiana. Ultimately, that is why I support it. In Louisiana, one out of every two seniors has no prescription drug coverage. Today, 72-year-old Ethel Cernigliaro of Homer is one of them. With only her $727 a month Social Security check to depend on, Mrs. Cernigliaro finds a way to pay her utilities, buy groceries and still cover the $300 and more she pays each month for prescriptions. At this point, Mrs. Cernigliaro doesn't know all of the details of how this Medicare reform will help her, but she is certain of one thing: It has got to be better than what she has now. ``I've been following it closely, and it is certainly encouraging to know someone is trying to do something,'' she said. This bill means seniors like Mrs. Cernigliaro will no longer be without assistance for the drugs they need to maintain their quality of life and health. She and the 200,000 seniors like her will, in most cases, pay no more than $5 a prescription for their medications. Because of this reform, no senior citizen in our State will be without some level of coverage for prescriptions. What's more, this bill will deliver $551 million over the next 10 years in emergency assistance for Louisiana's hospitals, most of which are struggling to keep their doors open. It will provide $156 million in much needed assistance to Louisiana's doctors. Without this assistance, these doctors could no longer afford to care for Medicare patients. It will provide $25 billion in help for our Nation's rural communities, many of which are in Louisiana. This represents the largest, most comprehensive rural package ever passed by Congress. Finally, this bill provides for much-needed prevention services, including screening for heart disease and diabetes, which could have helped to save the lives of the nearly 10,000 Louisiana seniors who died of these diseases last year. If this bill does not pass, the people of my State will go yet another year without these important interventions. I, for one, cannot ask them to wait. Since Medicare was first passed into law in 1965, it has been amended and modified hundreds of times. This comprehensive reform package is not the first, nor will it be the last. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the months and years to come to ensure that the Medicare program, and this new prescription drug benefit, will be all that it promises to be and more.","word.count":1559,"sep11":2.26123595505618,"years":2004.12078651685,"days":3247,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0906605640876249,"Topic 2":0.0090716082352653,"Topic 3":0.0109812563035694,"Topic 4":0.0066747158487181,"Topic 5":0.00430493555973466,"Topic 6":0.725933256692589,"Topic 7":0.00449734360365337,"Topic 8":0.131055023001594,"Topic 9":0.014499535385095,"Topic 10":0.0023217612821566},{"id":"10920050023323","body":"Neil Abercrombie: Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr. Speaker, I would like to insert into the Record at this time an article that appeared in the Economist magazine entitled ``The Case For Gay Marriage.''

My disappointment does not stem from doubts about Mr. Oberwetter's integrity or professional accomplishment. Indeed, in both categories he has my respect and admiration. However, I simply do not believe that Mr. Oberwetter possesses the proper experience to assume what has become one of the most important posts in our Nation's fight against terrorism. And while I will not stand in the way of Mr. Oberwetter's appointment, I believe it is important that the record show that the President's choice could certainly have been better. Saudi Arabia is one of the primary battlegrounds in the war on terror. This is not simply because 15 of the 19 hijackers from 9/11 were Saudi. Top anti-terror officials tell us that Saudi Arabia is also a hub for terrorist financing and extremist incitement. The inflammatory content of its educational textbooks promotes anti- American sentiment in the Kingdom and its support for extremist madrassas schools in Pakistan, southeast Asia and Africa gives life to institutions that are incubators for the next generation of terrorists abroad. Given this sad state of affairs, there are several reasons why Mr. Oberwetter should not be our nation's next Ambassador to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. First, he has absolutely no official diplomatic or anti- terror experience. As I have said many times before, we live in a post- 9/11 world where the old rules simply do not apply. Given that Saudi Arabia is one of the most important fronts in the war on terror, our top representative there can no longer be a run-of-the mill political appointee; rather, the American Ambassador to Saudi Arabia must be a seasoned diplomatic expert and someone with an extensive background in combating terrorist financing and religious extremism. Mr. Oberwetter's more than 25 years as an oil industry insider provide him with no background to assume this key position in the fight against terrorism. Indeed, his oil industry pedigree is another reason why he is an inappropriate choice to serve as Ambassador. While I have no doubts about Mr. Oberwetter's personal integrity, his proximity to the oil industry suggests that commercial rather than security interests appear to have taken precedence in the administration's decisionmaking. I simply do not understand this business-as-usual approach to diplomatic appointments when American lives are at stake. Surely there is someone more qualified than an oil executive that we could choose from the distinguished ranks of our Nation's diplomatic and security corps to occupy this important post in the war on terror. Mr. Oberwetter's nomination is a disappointment and does a disservice to our national security.","word.count":449,"sep11":2.25842696629213,"years":2004.11797752809,"days":3246,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.224917251804696,"Topic 2":0.0308434646409613,"Topic 3":0.004354849661716,"Topic 4":0.0417753619115014,"Topic 5":0.00397055694598976,"Topic 6":0.00410613884530805,"Topic 7":0.628809696338913,"Topic 8":0.0491247930608291,"Topic 9":0.00633301741293283,"Topic 10":0.0057648693771525},{"id":"10920060004749","body":"Debbie Wasserman Schultz: I will close just by saying this.

It is that the ideology and the incompetence are so intertwined that it doesn't matter which Republican you swap in. We have seen the board lit up here where you have moderate Republicans, arms wrenched behind their back when they are trying to express what is supposedly their conscience, and instead they are forced to vote according to the ideological stranglehold that is around the neck of the Republican leadership and the Republican Party. And so it doesn't matter who you swap in and out. If the ideology doesn't change, which it is clearly not going to, then you will just get more the same. Just like you will have more of the same in swapping the individual, one individual for another in the White House, as the President did today, and what you would see if we didn't make the change that is so necessary with the leadership in this country. I appreciate the opportunity to join my colleagues here again in the 30-something Working Group.","word.count":262,"sep11":4.66011235955056,"years":2006.51966292135,"days":4101,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.00999831412484672,"Topic 2":0.0138365695426282,"Topic 3":0.00612592624848485,"Topic 4":0.061341753105849,"Topic 5":0.00162521157264802,"Topic 6":0.00595511373156694,"Topic 7":0.0083339978528572,"Topic 8":0.070203265329097,"Topic 9":0.817982087162771,"Topic 10":0.00459776132925095},{"id":"11020070024759","body":"Bruce L.

This amendment would all but destroy the diversity visa program, which has served our country well and continues to do so. Yet it would have no meaningful effect on skill-based immigration, which is already favored by our immigration laws and is already being addressed elsewhere in the bill. That is why civil rights groups and ethnic groups are united with business groups in opposition to this amendment. I understand the thinking behind the Gregg amendment, and there are a few people in the Chamber who have been more consistent supporters of high-skilled immigration than have I. I continue to support high- skilled migration, and the original McCain-Kennedy bill doubled the numerical limits on high-skilled, employment-based migration. I also supported additional changes in the Judiciary Committee to increase H- 1B visa limits and to make it easier for H-1B immigrants to adjust to permanent status. But the diversity visa program serves a wholly different purpose. The purpose of the diversity visa is not just to advance narrow economic interests but, rather, to preserve our very heritage as a nation of immigrants, a true melting pot. Unlike other visa categories, the diversity visa is not about whom you know or to whom you are related. It is a totally unique program because anyone with a high school diploma or 2 years of meaningful work experience can apply. Without the diversity visa program, our family- and employment-based immigration system would ensure that virtually all immigrants to the United States would come from just a small handful of countries. The diversity program ensures that America continues to be a beacon to the entire world and not just to a dozen or so countries with high numbers of immigrants already living here. This chart here behind me shows, right here on the left, that of the groups coming in now, 36.8 percent are Asian, 46 percent are Latin American; that is 85 percent coming from the Caribbean countries or from Asia. We have 10 percent from Europe, 3 percent from Canada, Oceania, and 3 percent from Africa. That is currently the mix that is coming here. When we passed the 1965 act, we tried to provide 10,000 to 15,000 to each country so that we would have a flexible and diverse system. When we found out that for a variety of reasons we were getting this kind of a focus, what we did was develop a very modest diversity program so that other countries which were not participating, either with the very special skills or family relatives, would have an opportunity to come here. They had to demonstrate that they had a competency so that they were able to have skills which would make them active participants in our society. But it is limited to 42,000 as compared to 847,000, and look how it is distributed. It is an entirely different group. You have some from Africa, still have some from Latin America and Asia, but still a good many from Europe--essentially and effectively a different scene. That is what we are attempting to do. Now, we have been reminded by others of the fact that, well, we need to get to the special skills. But I would mention to our friends who are concerned about that, this is 50,000. Now look at what we are doing in terms of the special skills. We have close to 750,000 to 800,000-- 800,000 in this legislation, but the diversity is only 42,000. No one could suggest that we haven't been sensitive to understand the importance of people with high skills and what they can do in terms of our economy, but they are effectively wiping out this diversity program. Now, as you can see, the diversity visa is especially important when it comes to African immigration. Fewer than 4 percent of our family- and employment-based immigrants come from Africa, but almost 40 percent of the diversity visas are used for Africans. And even though only 1 in 20 green cards is a diversity visa, 1 in 3 green cards issued to an African is authorized through the program. One sure effect of the Gregg amendment is that it would substantially reduce African migration to this country. There is just no other visa out there that would replace these flows. That is one reason the groups are opposed to the Gregg amendment, including the NAACP, the Coalition on Human Rights, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, the Illinois Coalition for Migrant and Refugee Rights, and a number of other groups. What does the Gregg amendment hope to accomplish in exchange for giving up this program? While the diversity visa program has unchecked symbolic importance and is an important mechanism to protect balance and equality in migration flows, it is tiny in comparison to the existing high-skill program because the rules already favor the skilled immigrants. Three different classes of employment-based visas are reserved for the skilled immigrants and five different temporary worker programs: the H-1B, the L visas, the P visas, the O visas, the TN visas. These visas are already set aside for skilled workers. These are offices of various international companies that come in here; a variety of different kinds of visas. Some on the H-1B are virtually effectively almost automatic to be able to go to a university site, to be able to teach. They are not counted within the H-1B. So all but one of the programs already admit more immigrants than the Gregg amendment would generate through this change. Business groups oppose the Gregg amendment. I have letters from the Chamber of Commerce, the American Council on International Personnel, the National Association of Manufacturers, the Business Roundtable--all major business associations which support high-skilled immigration and all opposing the Gregg amendment. So here is what the Gregg amendment would do. It would change the diversity program from a tiny slice of the pie to a minuscule slice. These are the two, the diversity visas being at the top. It is now a small group, which is gray in this setting, and you can look over here and it is still gray, but it is a fraction of what it is in terms of the diversity flows. The flows are already one-twentieth, just one- twentieth of high-skilled flows, and under the Gregg amendment, they would be cut to less than 2 percent. These charts actually understate what is going on by a wide margin because the underlying bill already roughly triples numerical limits on high-skilled immigrants. Is the benefit to high-skilled employers of an extra 37,000 visas really worth the price of eviscerating this successful program? Are we willing to give up so much to gain so little? Another reason to oppose the Gregg amendment is that for millions of people around the world, the diversity visa has come to symbolize the American dream. Eight million people applied for this. Eight million people look to the United States and say: Maybe I will have a chance. I have to complete my high school or the equivalent of 2 years of college, so I have to meet those kinds of standards. I have to meet all the other national security standards. You have to demonstrate that you are not going to be a burden, an economic burden. But 8 million people in countries all over the world--all over the world--who look to the United States as being the country of hope and liberty have a crack at getting into the United States. Not much of one--42,000--but they have to come from the areas where we don't have large flows of immigrants coming in. That was the purpose, for the United States to be a diverse society, to be the true melting pot at the time. This is just a very small kind of a program. We are going to sacrifice that aspect for 8 million people all over the world who think they may be the ones who have a shot at getting into the United States, and we will say: Oh, no, it is just going to be the highly skilled, when we have 800,000 of those already coming in here, three times as many as we have now. How many is enough? How many is enough? So the diversity visa program symbolizes what makes America great because with a little luck and hard work, anyone can succeed here. We are the only country that can say that.","word.count":1452,"sep11":4.82022471910112,"years":2006.6797752809,"days":4158,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0991973898681861,"Topic 2":0.215532056369432,"Topic 3":0.0054818379639955,"Topic 4":0.0151871250835056,"Topic 5":0.00788570792315138,"Topic 6":0.00581440921263999,"Topic 7":0.00677700744189809,"Topic 8":0.529836042065182,"Topic 9":0.103667680400937,"Topic 10":0.010620743671073},{"id":"10519970025142","body":"Sherrod Brown: Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word Mr. Chairman, I wish to engage in a colloquy with the distinguished gentleman from Ohio , chairman of the Subcommittee on Interior Appropriations, concerning the proposed National Eagle Center in Wabasha, Minnesota. Many of my colleagues may recall a CBS report last winter concerning efforts in the City of Wabasha, Minnesota, to construct a National Eagle Center. In his news report, anchorman Harry Smith stated that it makes his heart quicken to see this magnificent symbol of our Nation in its natural environment: Hundreds of bald eagles perched in the cottonwoods and fishing along the banks of the Mississippi River near Wabasha, a community of 2,500 people made famous by the movie, ``Grumpy Old Men.'' Mr. Chairman, Harry Smith is not unlike millions of Americans who are thrilled to have a rare chance to see a bald eagle in the wild. In fact, CBS News officials said the network received more phone calls requesting copies of this story of Smith's than any other. For the past 9 years, 70 volunteers from in and around Wabasha, Minnesota, have generously donated their time and talent in order to share this once-in-a-lifetime experience with the thousands of visitors who come each year to see this remarkable bird. These thousands of visitors come to Wabasha because nowhere else in the lower 48 States can one find a better view of this, our national symbol. Nowhere else can visitors benefit, free of charge, from a trained staff of volunteers who help them spot and learn more about the Bald Eagle. But as my colleague knows, Minnesota can get very cold in the winter, and that is why the City of Wabasha and the State of Minnesota have joined forces and contributed $1.9 million, about half the amount necessary, to construct an indoor eagle viewing and educational facility for the benefit of visitors from all over the country. Mr. Chairman, I have asked the gentleman from Ohio , the chairman of the subcommittee, if he would lend his support for the National Eagle Center. I understand the chairman will consider this request as the Interior bill is taken up in conference with the Senate.","word.count":492,"sep11":-4.22752808988764,"years":1997.63202247191,"days":937,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.306026805798155,"Topic 2":0.359786487781133,"Topic 3":0.0149521649686357,"Topic 4":0.072007280969727,"Topic 5":0.0171717838733611,"Topic 6":0.0141532628528861,"Topic 7":0.0952927380995436,"Topic 8":0.012504396333156,"Topic 9":0.103692862457454,"Topic 10":0.00441221686594805},{"id":"11020070102342","body":"Debbie Stabenow: Mr. President, I thank Senator Harkin and Senator Chambliss and all those involved in putting together the bipartisan farm bill.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge all of my colleagues to support S.J. Res. 28, a resolution recognizing the sixtieth anniversary of the Allied landing at Normandy. Mr. Speaker, like many of my colleagues, this past weekend both my wife Marie and I joined with President Bush, former Senator Bob Dole and tens of thousands of veterans, many of them from the Second World War, as the new National World War II Memorial was dedicated. As Marie and I stood on the Mall, we were reminded of the valor and sacrifice of millions of American men and women who wore our Nation's uniform during this war, including my father, a combat Army veteran who saw horrific combat that began in New Guinea and ended in the Philippines, and my wife's father, who served with honor and distinction on the USS Canberra in the South Pacific. Several of our relatives saw combat during the Second World War, including Marie's uncle, Joseph Hahn, of the 29th Division, 116th Regiment, 121st Engineering Battalion, who hit the beaches on that historic day when the tides of war were turned in our favor. Corporal Hahn hit the beach on Omaha Beach on June 6, and he was part of that very courageous group of men who bravely fought their way through one of the most treacherous battlefields in history and made it to St. Lo on July 18th. Six weeks to advance about 30 miles underscores how bad that battle really was and how vociferous were the forces that were arrayed against them. But they prevailed! It occurred to me at the monument dedication Saturday, Mr. Speaker, that World War II could have had a different outcome and could have turned out differently. Nowhere is this more evident than the D-Day landings on June 6 of 1944. Many Americans look back upon D-Day and think that it was the inevitable beginning of Europe's liberation from the clutches of Nazi Germany. Yet, on June 6, 1944, failure was still possible. In fact, when we pause and consider the magnitude and the scale of such an enormously complicated military operation waged by multiple nations, it sometimes seems amazing that the operation ever succeeded. Historian Stephen Ambrose put the significance of this operation into perspective. He said, ``You can't exaggerate it. You can't overstate it. D-Day was the pivot point of the 20th century. It was the day on which the decision was made as to who was going to rule this world in the second half of the 20th century. Is it going to be Nazism, is it going to be Communism, or are the democracies going to prevail?'' He goes on to say, ``If we would have failed on Omaha Beach and on the other beaches on the 6th of June in 1944, the struggle for Europe would have been a struggle between Hitler and Stalin, and we would have been out of it.'' Mr. Speaker, it is worth noting that even General Dwight D. Eisenhower himself was not completely confident of victory. Prior to the launch of the great amphibious assault, he scribbled a note, a brief note about what he would say to the press in the event that the invasion failed, and he kept it in his wallet. While General Eisenhower had reasonable faith in his war plan, he was also fully cognizant of just how badly things could go awry in the fog of war, even if everything else had gone perfectly and went out on schedule. As we all know now, Mr. Speaker, as dawn broke on June 6, 1944, a great invasion force stood off the coast of Normandy awaiting the commencement of Operation Overlord. In all, there were nine battleships, 23 cruisers, 104 destroyers, and 71 large landing craft of various descriptions, as well as troop transports, mine sweepers, and merchantmen. Combined, these forces constituted nearly 5,000 ships of every type, the largest armada ever assembled. Allied air forces flew 11,000 sorties to provide air cover, bomb fortifications, and, most importantly, to pin down German tanks poised to drive any Allied beachhead back into the sea. As Operation Overlord continued, several of the Allied beach landings went relatively smoothly and according to plan. But at the beach code- named Omaha, many things seemed to go wrong all at once for the primarily American force. According to some estimates, barely one-third of the first wave of attackers ever reached dry land. Only sheer bravery and the monumental effort of human will posed against impossible odds carried the day at Omaha Beach. About 2,500 men were killed or wounded at Omaha Beach alone. By the end of D-Day, the total of dead and injured topped 9,000. The American share was about 6,500. Among the American airborne divisions, about 2,500 became casualties. Canadian forces experienced about 1,100 casualties, and another 3,000 British soldiers were killed or wounded. Approximately one-third of the casualties were killed in action. Despite the losses and the unspeakable hardship endured by so many, the invasion succeeded. More than 100,000 men and 10,000 vehicles came ashore that day, the first of millions who would join them and finally put an end to Nazi Germany. Mr. Speaker, our Nation must never take for granted the sacrifices that were made to liberate Europe and to preserve freedom. We must never forget the veterans who scaled the cliffs and stormed the beaches of Normandy against overwhelming odds. I urge all Members to strongly support this resolution.","word.count":332,"sep11":1.73033707865169,"years":2003.58988764045,"days":3058,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0265559441261272,"Topic 2":0.405355467650056,"Topic 3":0.0123996655568583,"Topic 4":0.441735327259851,"Topic 5":0.03032176749912,"Topic 6":0.00347514000880167,"Topic 7":0.0174662977780643,"Topic 8":0.00990612652554787,"Topic 9":0.0456216124481066,"Topic 10":0.00716265114746578},{"id":"10419960047488","body":"Harry Reid: Mr. President, I have here a letter from the Evangelical Environmental Network consisting of a number of people, including Dr. Robert C.

Mr. President, we have received letters from all over the country, not the least of which is a letter from a group of physicians. I talked about some of the things they said yesterday. But, in effect, what they say is that it is wrong to have this moratorium; it is wrong for health reasons to millions of people throughout the world. This letter is signed by representatives of the Physicians for Social Responsibility, the National Association of Physicians for the Environment, someone from the Pennsylvania Medical Society, the Massachusetts Medical Society, the Nevada Medical Society, the Vermont Medical Society, the Arthritis Foundation, AIDS Action Council, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston University, and on and on, Mr. President, with people from the medical community who say that this moratorium is not only wrong from a political standpoint; it is wrong from a moral perspective. Mr. President, last night I went back to the office and asked my staff to look at some of the things we have received over our computer, over our e-mail network. We received--and I just at random picked a few--we received something from Basking Ridge, NJ, from a woman who says: It is written to various Senators. That letter was from Merideth Mueller. I received a letter from Minnesota from one Todd Burnside of Roseville, MN. He says: I received also, Mr. President, a copy of an e-mail written to all Senators: Mr. President, it is obvious what has happened here. The second- degree amendment calls for emergency listings only. We know that this will allow people to file all kinds of lawsuits to have emergency listings. We know that there were listings prior to this moratorium being pronounced. They should proceed in an orderly fashion. What this second-degree amendment will do is force the Department of the Interior to defend numerous lawsuits to show that what they are doing is adequate. We need to get rid of this moratorium and get back to good science and good protection of the environment and these species. What is taking place now is an assault on good science and good government. It also allows this body to simply not go forward with reauthorizing the Endangered Species Act. As long as this moratorium is in effect, there will be no further listings, and that is wrong. This moratorium, I think it is clear, is going to continue throughout this Congress with all we have to do with all the problems with the balanced budget and 13 appropriations bills, 5 of which we did not pass last year. I think it is going to be extremely difficult to reauthorize this bill. This is a license to repudiate the Endangered Species Act. I think we as a country and we as a Congress should be ashamed if we allow this to happen.

Madam Speaker, here's what Ms. Slaughter and Mrs. Biggert have achieved. Somewhere this morning, a family is going to get news that a biopsy came back with bad news, that someone they love has a tumor, and that family is going to go through the agony of the next couple of months or even years of wondering if that person they love so much is going to live or die. Now the progress we have made in this country, thank God, has let many more of those people live. But the ultimate progress is to get to the genetic puzzle that makes that person susceptible to that tumor in the first place. The way we are going to find the solution to that puzzle is by gathering data by more and more people being willing to share their genetic information with the brightest men and women in this country. Right now there's a justifiable fear that if you share your genetic information, someone may misuse it to deny you a job, deny you an insurance policy, or hurt you in some other way. This bill lifts that burden, lifts that fear, and will stimulate millions of Americans to voluntarily, privately and safely participate so they can be part of finding this puzzle. What Chairwoman Slaughter has accomplished today, Madam Speaker, is that some day is coming, and I hope it's soon, when people will get the right answer all the time to that question, when the cure will be here, the pain will be gone, and the hope will prevail.

EPA has simply ignored all of these improvements and based a rule on 15-year-old data in order to inflate its benefits. This rule will cost refineries and fuel consumers in this country at least $100 million each year. This puts refineries in Montana and throughout the Nation at economic risk. And what about the jobs these refineries provide the local communities? Well, they are at risk, too. Almost $20 million of this will be spent to meet the paperwork and monitoring requirements of the rule which do nothing to improve public health or the environmental protection. Mr. President, I would like to make one final point. All of the information is based on EPA's own data and analysis. None of this information is based on any kind of industry study. This information can be found in the final rule published in the Federal Register on August 18, 1995. Refiners in Montana have simply asked that this rule be based on sound science, including accurate and current data. They have not asked for any rollback of environmental regulations. Since the data are the basis for the entire rulemaking, it seems to me that EPA must go back to the beginning and redo the rule from scratch. I look forward to working with the chairman in conference regarding the refinery MACT rule; and I thank him.","word.count":367,"sep11":-6.1123595505618,"years":1995.74719101124,"days":266,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.110875318812742,"Topic 2":0.0125240191662412,"Topic 3":0.00553271017317985,"Topic 4":0.00903312184594934,"Topic 5":0.00381072839002963,"Topic 6":0.0200503587024803,"Topic 7":0.00316889742052256,"Topic 8":0.395351250965123,"Topic 9":0.0618063658943925,"Topic 10":0.377847228629339},{"id":"10720020026302","body":"Lynn Woolsey: Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5331 would ensure that the educational records of home-schooled students are provided the same protections as the education records of non-home-schooled students.

I filed an amendment that requires the redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq by December 31, 2006. Unfortunately, the Senate will not be given the opportunity to vote on this amendment if we invoke cloture on the emergency supplemental bill we will be considering shortly. I am afraid this body has failed time and time again to debate the direction of our country's policy in Iraq. Three years ago, the President landed on an aircraft carrier and, as we all remember, declared ``Mission Accomplished'' in Iraq. Today, with thousands of lives lost and billions of dollars spent, we are still no closer to a policy that lifts the burden from our troops and taxpayers and actually makes our country safer from the terrorist networks that seek to hurt us. By failing to discuss alternatives to the administration's failed Iraq policy, we have let down this institution and our constituents. We simply cannot continue to avoid asking the tough questions about Iraq. We should not be appropriating billions of dollars for Iraq without debating and demanding a strategy to complete our military mission there, not when the lives of our soldiers and the safety of our country are at risk. Our military has performed heroically in Iraq, but the continued and indefinite presence of large U.S. forces there significantly weakens our ability to fight the global terrorism networks that threaten us today. That is why I filed an amendment requiring the Pentagon to draw up a flexible time line for redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq by the end of this year. The President has repeatedly failed to spell out for the American people when we can expect our troops to redeploy from Iraq. He has refused to provide a vision for ending our military mission in Iraq, and as a result a growing majority of Americans have lost confidence in our purpose, our direction, and our presence in Iraq. Last August, I proposed a target date for withdrawal when I suggested U.S. troops leave Iraq by the end of 2006. This amendment in part reflects the fact that the administration has made no progress--no progress whatsoever--in developing a clear vision for ending our military mission, redeploying U.S. troops from Iraq, and refocusing on the real national security threats that face our country. My amendment spells out what an increasing number of military intelligence and diplomatic officials have been saying for a very long time: that a massive and seemingly indefinite U.S. presence in Iraq is destabilizing and potentially damaging to Iraqi efforts to rebuild their government and their country. Our presence in some ways is generating instability in Iraq, and the less we make it clear that our intent is to leave and to leave now, our presence can become more harmful than it is helpful. More important, though, is the fact that our current Iraq policy is making the United States weaker, not stronger. We need to redeploy U.S. forces from Iraq because, as a result of our current costly and burdensome presence in Iraq, we are unable to direct our resources worldwide to defeat the wide and growing network of terrorist organizations that seek to harm Americans and America. This administration has compounded its misguided decision to wage war in Iraq by refusing to recognize the consequences of its actions, the tremendous cost to our brave troops and their loved ones, the drain on our financial resources, and the burden on our Nation's national security sources and infrastructure, which are unable to focus on new and emerging threats to our country. I don't have to point very far to show how imbalanced and burdensome are our policies in Iraq. While we have spent, according to the Congressional Research Service, upwards of $6 billion per week during Operation Iraqi Freedom and $1.3 billion per week during Operation Enduring Freedom, we are spending a little more than $2 million--$2 million--annually--not weekly, annually--in Somalia, a known haven for terrorists and criminals and a true threat to our national security. This supplemental appropriation, if passed, will increase the cost of this war to $320 billion, and rising. This is simply unsustainable, and because the President has failed to provide us with any semblance of a vision for when our troops will be redeployed, we can expect more of the same in years to come; that is, unless the Congress finally requires the administration to develop an Iraq strategy that includes a flexible time line for redeploying our troops by the end of 2006. My amendment recognizes the need to maintain a minimal level of U.S. forces in Iraq beyond 2006. Those forces will be needed for engaging directly and targeting counterterrorism activities, training Iraq in security forces, and protecting essential U.S. infrastructure and personnel. It is time for Members of Congress to stand up to an administration that continues to lead us astray on what has become an extremely costly and mistaken war. We need to hold this administration accountable for its neglect of urgent national security priorities in favor of staying a flawed policy course in Iraq. We need to tell the administration that it can't continue to send our men and women in uniform into harm's way without a clear and convincing strategy for success. Some have suggested that we should tie our military presence in Iraq to whether Iraqis are able to form a unity government. While I share their frustration with the status quo, I think the decisions about troop presence should be based on what is best for our country's national security. Making decisions about our troop levels contingent on a political solution in Iraq doesn't make sense. Our troops should not be held hostage to the failure to bring about a political solution in Iraq. So here is the bottom line: We need to refocus on fighting and defeating the terrorist network that attacked this country on September 11, 2001, and that means placing our Iraq policy in the context of a global effort rather than letting it dominate our security strategy and drain vital security resources for an unlimited amount of time. The President's Iraq-centric policies are preventing us from effectively engaging serious threats around the world, including Iran, global terrorist networks, and other emerging threats. We must change course in Iraq, and we must change course now. It is in this spirit that I filed this amendment to this supplemental spending bill. If I am not allowed a vote on my amendment to the supplemental, I can assure my colleagues that I will be looking for the next opportunity to bring this amendment to the floor for debate and a vote. My colleagues are, of course, entitled to disagree with my approach. I welcome their suggestions and their advice. But what I really want is for the Senate to live up to its responsibility and engage in a serious debate about the topic that is on the mind of every American: how to put our Iraq policy right and our national security policy right. Mr. President, I yield the floor.","word.count":1214,"sep11":4.75842696629214,"years":2006.61797752809,"days":4136,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.131730820874404,"Topic 2":0.303250757314665,"Topic 3":0.0592710224551802,"Topic 4":0.00599314891157102,"Topic 5":0.155186091593797,"Topic 6":0.00330467582247919,"Topic 7":0.00199778333518897,"Topic 8":0.0524535292987373,"Topic 9":0.00427969217301109,"Topic 10":0.282532478220967},{"id":"11020080054037","body":"Charles E. Schumer: Mr. President, I rise to talk about high gas prices and the fact that so many of my colleagues from across the aisle have no interest or seem to have no interest in addressing the problem. Republicans seem not to care about the pain at the pump, but they may well care about the pain at the polls that could come from ignoring this crisis and their constituents. The bottom line is, we are asking to have a debate on the issue of how to reduce gas prices, and the other side just says no. They may have a different solution than we do. They think ANWR is the answer, the Alaska oilfields. We all know that would take 7 years before a drop of oil would come, and most estimates say it would not reduce the price by very much at all. But let's debate it. We are willing to debate ANWR, an issue they care about. Why are they not willing to debate the windfall profits tax or dealing with speculation or dealing with the cartel of OPEC? We are happy to debate it all. Make no mistake, we are facing an energy crisis that has led to a painful and unprecedented spike in the price of oil--$140 a barrel, $4 a gallon--and the minority, the Republicans say this is a problem that is not worthy of our attention or action. It is hard to believe. When you go home, whether it is at a parade or a veterans hall, even at weddings and christenings, people are coming over to you and asking: What are you doing about gas prices? The other side says: Let's not debate it. It is incredible. Eighty-six percent of Americans are unhappy with the state of our economy. The most tangible symbol of this is $4 a gallon gasoline. I can't understand why my colleagues on the other side of the aisle refuse to address this issue and block us from helping American consumers as our economy continues to falter. They can filibuster all they want. We are up to 75 filibusters. Seventy-five times, they said: We don't want to move forward. We don't want to debate. But they cannot play the American people for fools. Come November, they will reap what they sow. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle will filibuster themselves right out of their Senate seats. The American public will not take lightly the fact that Senate Republicans have prevented anyone from helping. They will see through the shams and the false ideas. The strategy of playing to a base that is becoming more and more narrow is going to cost them dearly because the American people know which party is blocking action on energy prices and on tax extenders. For all the talk about how American families have benefited from the Bush tax cuts, for all the emphasis Senator McCain is placing on making them permanent, the simple, undeniable, you-can-look-it-up, no-spin truth is that the average American family is paying far more in higher gas prices this year than they received from the Bush tax cuts. So set aside for a moment higher health care costs, higher tuition costs, higher food prices, and all the other ways American families are feeling the pinch. They are paying more this year in gas prices alone than they received in the Bush tax cuts. Let me repeat that. They are paying more this year in gas prices alone than they received in the Bush tax cuts. Our friends across the aisle have turned the economic stimulus plan into the big-oil stimulus plan. It is unconscionable that the American public is being forced to use their stimulus checks just to pay for gas. I have asked myself, Why don't they even want to debate the issue? We are willing to debate ANWR. We are willing to debate some of their solutions. Why aren't they willing to debate ours? I will tell you why. There are too many people who don't want to vote yes or no. They are torn between their base, their oil company constituency, and the rest of America. So they want to duck. But that policy is not going to work--not this time, not this place, not this year. So we are here today to ask that we be allowed to debate the two issues they blocked us on yesterday. This week in the Senate Republicans are blocking lower energy costs. Let me repeat that because clear as a bell, that is what is happening. This week in the Senate Republicans are blocking lower energy costs. We cannot even debate them. Yesterday, they blocked us twice from debating legislation to address rising gas prices. The Senate majority leader put together a comprehensive energy package, the Consumer-First Energy Act. Senator Baucus put together the Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act that extended tax credits to promote renewable energy and break our dependence on foreign oil. What did they say to either of these in terms of not just a lack of support but debate? No, no, no. So we are stuck with high oil prices, and instead of letting us debate these pieces of legislation, my colleagues on the other side and the Bush administration keep going back to the same old tired idea: Drilling in Alaska. And do not be fooled because presenting this idea is like a poorly performed magic trick. It does not work, and if you look closely enough, you can see through the smoke and mirrors. Let me ask my colleagues, when would ANWR drilling have an impact on prices? When are we going to get the first bit of oil? In 2018. Do the American people want to wait until 2018, 10 years from now? We Democrats--I was one of the leaders here--agreed last year to drill in the east gulf. That would have increased domestic production over the next few years. So when the other side says: We don't want to drill--we believe we cannot drill our way out of the problem. We need a profound change in energy policy. But to alleviate the short-term pain--not 10 years from now but more immediately--we have said drill in the east gulf. I helped round up Democratic votes to pass that bill. So we are not saying do not drill, but we are saying we need a profound change in energy policy. ANWR is too far away. We should be changing the policy long before 2018 when the first drop of ANWR oil would come. Perhaps the only thing we have done that will help reduce the price of oil and gas in the last while is something that had to wait for a Democratic Congress and Senate: Higher mileage standards in the cars. That will be something. But we need to do a lot more. We need to go after the oil companies. We need to go after OPEC. We need to stop rampant speculation. The Consumer-First Energy Act does those things. We need to change our tax policy so instead of giving breaks and subsidies to the oil companies, we start encouraging alternative energy: Solar, wind, biomass--you name it. In conclusion, yesterday we heard simply: No, we will not debate oil prices. They are blocking lower energy costs. We hope over the next day or two our Republican colleagues will rethink that position and join us in a fulsome debate because otherwise we will not get gas prices to go down. Mr. President, I yield the floor.","word.count":1256,"sep11":6.92415730337079,"years":2008.78370786517,"days":4907,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.502054564737959,"Topic 2":0.29204638039297,"Topic 3":0.0478929210043768,"Topic 4":0.0232293118713797,"Topic 5":0.0162908594862735,"Topic 6":0.00903857551726003,"Topic 7":0.0494237371756515,"Topic 8":0.011736115197715,"Topic 9":0.0428858971998113,"Topic 10":0.00540163741660323},{"id":"10519980045845","body":"Joseph Lieberman: I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague from Wisconsin. Mr. President, I have spent so much time on this subject in the last year that I think I can just clear my throat in 5 minutes. But I will try to do more than that, and I hope to have additional opportunities to comment as the debate goes on. I want to speak against the underlying proposal, the so-called Paycheck Protection Act, and in favor of the substitute McCain-Feingold proposal that is before us. The Paycheck Protection Act, very briefly, is a very disappointing response to the many problems the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee uncovered in its recently concluded investigation. In fact, I was very surprised to see my dear friend, the majority leader, say yesterday, ``I have laid down a bill that embodies the most important campaign finance reform of all, paycheck protection.'' Frankly, there is not a single problem, with all respect, looked at during our investigation in the Governmental Affairs Committee that would have been solved with the Paycheck Protection Act. ``Paycheck Protection'' doesn't touch foreign money, it doesn't touch the use of public buildings for fundraising, it doesn't touch the problem of unregulated and undisclosed attack ads, and it doesn't touch the abuse of tax-exempt status by tax-exempt organizations. In fact, the underlying bill, the Paycheck Protection Act, is a response to a problem that doesn't exist. No one is forced to join a union, and under the Beck decision, nonunion members already have an absolute right to ask for a refund of the amount they paid the union in agency fees that went to political activities of which they do not approve. Union members, for their part, voluntarily join an organization, and they express a desire to have their leadership represent them, both with management and more generally. If they disagree with the way in which the leadership of the union is spending that money for political or legislative purposes, they have the same right that shareholders have who are disgruntled with the activities of the leadership of a corporation. Shareholders can launch a proxy fight. Disgruntled union members can try to change the leadership of the union. There is a democratic process dramatically, intensely supervised by the Federal Government itself. In fact, I suggest that the Paycheck Protection Act as before us is not only a solution to a problem that doesn't exist, it is itself a problem because it is of doubtful constitutionality. This bill says to a union that before it can involve itself in political activities, before it can spend its own general treasury funds, contributed by dues-paying members, not just on political campaigns but, by definition in the underlying bill, in attempting to influence legislation, the union leadership needs the separate prior written voluntary authorization of each one of their members. To me, that comes close to being a prior restraint on the exercise by a labor union of the rights it receives under the First Amendment to petition our Government to attempt to influence legislation and to free association. If that is not the case, it certainly raises questions of equal protection, because there is no similar restriction put on any other organization that I know of, including particularly corporations. True, there is language in the paycheck protection bill that deals with corporations, but by not even trying to cover shareholders, it is plainly not at all equivalent to the restriction on the expenditure of union dues. On the other side, McCain-Feingold, with appreciation to its two cosponsors--a great example of the kind of bipartisanship that should exist around here--is a practical response to the problems that came before the Governmental Affairs Committee. The arguments against it, with all respect, are premised on this strange twist of principle that money is speech. I think it was my friend, the junior Senator from Georgia, who said last year, if money is speech under the Constitution, that must mean that the more money you have, the greater is your right to free speech. Is that what the Framers of the Constitution meant when they said that all of us are created equal, we have an equal right, unfettered, to petition our Government? I don't think so. Against that specious principle, money is speech, they have undercut the sacred principle of equality of access to our Government. So I say the soft money ban and the other limits in the McCain- Feingold proposal are constitutional. In the Buckley decision, the Court made it clear that it is constitutional to limit contributions to campaigns, and this ban on soft money is just another way to do that. The fact is, as Chairman Thompson of the Governmental Affairs Committee said during our proceedings, effectively, there is no campaign finance law anymore in the United States of America, and the reason why the limits on individual contributions, the prohibitions on corporate and union money that are in the law are no longer effective is mostly because of soft money.","word.count":836,"sep11":-3.6376404494382,"years":1998.22191011236,"days":1147,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0748037115890808,"Topic 2":0.477252486509654,"Topic 3":0.0498213652101601,"Topic 4":0.188812843925344,"Topic 5":0.164448121627605,"Topic 6":0.00292459531604164,"Topic 7":0.00307591530734459,"Topic 8":0.0167417817084568,"Topic 9":0.0169018624013086,"Topic 10":0.00521731640500441},{"id":"11020070103243","body":"Carl Levin: Mr. President, before the Senator is recognized, I wish to thank the majority leader, Senator Reid, obviously for the comments he made about me, which were extremely meaningful to me and will be memorable to my family, although they will discount it hopefully somewhat.

Sometimes we get caught in our bubble in Washington and we forget, we forget there is a whole world outside in this great land of ours: working families, folks who are working hard each and every day to provide for their families, to ensure their safety, to take care of their children, to be a part of their community, and to help their neighbors. On October 25 our Senate Agriculture Committee passed this legislation unanimously, not one single dissenting vote. And that is because there were a lot of Members who understood the importance of this bill. They came together and worked to come up with a bill in which everyone had a vested interest. It passed unanimously for good reason. It does a tremendous amount not only for our farm families but for antihunger advocates, for environmentalists, those working to spur economic development in rural areas, and it takes tremendous strides to rid our Nation of its dependence on foreign oil. All of those are positive, progressive things that happen in this bill, brought together, again, by a group in the Senate Agriculture Committee who wanted to make progress, who wanted to put together a bill everybody could be proud of, that everybody could help move forward. I know this policy effort is not on the top of everyone's priority list in this body like it is on mine. It is on the top of my mine, and it is a huge priority for me for multiple reasons. One, I am a farmer's daughter. I understand. I understand what farm families are doing out there. I understand, when they get up at the crack of dawn, before the Sun comes up, they get out and work hard, to do something that gives them a tremendous sense of pride. They produce a safe and abundant and affordable supply of food and fiber for this country. I also know it is a huge priority for me because of my State, and the fact that my State has an economy that is based on agriculture. They have a great sense of pride in not only being able to provide that safe and abundant and affordable food supply in the most efficient way possible for this great land, but they do so worldwide as well. At a minimum, everyone here should recognize and appreciate what this bill accomplishes, even if you take for granted that the grocery store shelves are full when you go in that grocery store, even if you take for granted that you pay less than anybody in the developed world per capita for your food source, and even if you take for granted the fact that it is produced in the most environmentally respectful way, and also that it is produced in a way that is safe, through all kinds of regulations, all kinds of research that provides us the sound backing that our food source is safe. It is safe for our children, safe for our elderly, safe for our families. That is huge. At a time when we are seeing foods coming in through our borders, through our ports that are unsafe from countries that do not put on those restrictions and regulations, for countries that do not have the efficiency on their farms that we do, it is absolutely critical that we bring ourselves together and focus on this bill. In this bill there is a $5.28 billion increase--an increase--to our nutrition programs. These are programs that provide assistance and a nutritious meal at breakfast and lunch for children, nutritious meals for the elderly across this country, nutritious summer feeding programs, nutritious fruits and vegetables and snacks for school children. That is a huge step in the right direction. Something we can all get behind is over a $4 billion increase to conservation. You know it is unbelievable to see that kind of an increase to reinforce those who love and use the land, that they can do so with the incentives to make sure they are using the optimum of technology and research to conserve that land that means so much to them and to future generations. That is a third straight record for the farm bill in terms of increases in what we are seeing in this underlying bill. There is $500 million for rural development in our small communities where we are seeing a desperate need for broadband and access to the information highway where we are looking for investment from entrepreneurs and small businesses so that we can keep strong our communities in rural America, and we do not see this flight into the cities, making sure those communities can be strong for the schools and for churches and for children and the working families who live in those rural communities, who have their heritage, their heart is there in that community, so that they can stay there, so that we as a nation make those investments. The energy incentives in this bill, when it is coupled with the Finance Committee incentives, shows a true commitment to moving renewable fuels into the marketplace. You know, it does not make a bit of difference if we continue to produce all of these renewable fuels if we do not get them into the marketplace, if we do not get them into the hands of consumers. And it also does not make any difference if we do not start to think outside the box, looking for newer and more innovative processes and research to provide renewable fuels that come from feedstock that might be leftovers. We know we can make cellulosic ethanol from cotton sticks and rice hulls and rice straw, but we have to get that to the consumer. We have to get that process going. There are great opportunities in this bill for that. In short, this bill is a win for every region of our great Nation. And everyone, even if your plow is a pencil, even if you have not spent time walking rice levees or scouting cotton or chopping down coffee bean plants in a bean field like I have, even if your plow is a pencil and the closest farm is 1,000 miles away from you, it should be so obvious to everyone that the farm bill provides exactly what this title suggests: it provides this Nation's security, it provides us with security of knowing that we will have the domestic production of a food supply for our people and for our Nation, that we will help feed the world with that safe and affordable and abundant supply of food and fiber. Unfortunately, it is clear by the criticisms of the farm bill by the editorial boards and major newspapers that many of our hard-working farm families are not getting the respect they deserve for what it is they provide. It is my hope the Senate will not also take for granted the security of safe food and fiber at a time when so much of what is entering this country is either not inspected, nor safe, or sent back. We had a hearing in the Finance Committee. We were told about port shopping, that products coming in commodities, coming into our country come to one of our ports, get inspected, get rejected, and then they start shopping around for a port that does not have an inspector. And, yes, we have ports without inspectors. So not only are we accepting substandard food, but we are minimizing our ability to produce our own with the control and the oversight that ensures us that what we produce domestically is safe. This piece of legislation is about national security, just as foreign policy is in many other regions of the world. Why is it we think that when we go to these trade negotiations, usually the last thing that is negotiated is agricultural products? It is because those countries understand. Those countries have been hungry. They have been subjected to foods that are unsafe or grown in a manner they don't appreciate. But they also know they can control making sure that there is enough there, if they can control and keep out our products. Many of the commodities I grow do find themselves on the international scene as commodities left out of trade agreements. That is because they are critical. They are a staple in the global community for sustenance of life. Whether a country provides subsidies at levels much higher than those included in this bill or protects their farmers by a prohibitive tariff structure, every country in some form or fashion ensures a domestic food supply. If we continue in the direction we are going, where we are seeing for the first time in the history of our country the possibility of a trade deficit in agricultural products, what is that going to mean to us as a nation? It is going to mean we are then going to be more dependent on other countries for food that is critical for children and families all across this land. In the United States, the farm bill is the policy that ensures safe food and fiber. We have worked hard in the Agriculture Committee to come up with a bill that was both bipartisan and biregional, agreed upon by everybody. Everybody got something positive out of a bill that was respectful to the diversity of this country, to the diversity of how we grow our crops. Lord, it was interesting for me to talk with my colleagues from way up on the Canadian border who had snow in August. We had 12 straight days of over 100-degree weather in Arkansas. We are a diverse nation and we are blessed to be that way. It is all the more reason we have the responsibility in this body to be respectful of that diversity and what it is that each of us has to bring to the table from our States. The Agriculture Committee did that. It also respected the needs of those who are less fortunate in the nutrition title. It respected the idea that Americans want to ensure conservation and good stewardship of the land. We did that. We looked at the need for renewable energy, and we have made a huge investment, both in the farm bill in authorizing policy and also in the Finance Committee package that accompanies it, making sure that incentives are there for communities and for ag producers and all of those in rural America that not only can we continue the research but get into production of renewable fuels and, most importantly, that we can g","word.count":2082,"sep11":6.33426966292135,"years":2008.19382022472,"days":4697,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.313923273740218,"Topic 2":0.0109132530144126,"Topic 3":0.00972175003348729,"Topic 4":0.280962815057681,"Topic 5":0.00211699245760286,"Topic 6":0.356699014736899,"Topic 7":0.00398617849281589,"Topic 8":0.0151912078562938,"Topic 9":0.00484686715620381,"Topic 10":0.00163864745438472},{"id":"11020080028554","body":"Peter Welch: Madam Speaker, it is my great pleasure to pay tribute to Mr. Nick Donofrio who is retiring after 40 years of serving the IBM Corporation.

But this bill is tragically misguided. The discussion we have heard here tonight has been about the power of HMOs and the lack of power of doctors. The reality is that there is an omitted party. The omitted party is the patients. If we empower doctors to unionize, there will be one thing that will happen, mark my words. The cost of health care will go up. I love doctors, and they will try to protect patients, but their number one motivation will be to negotiate increased fees for them. The cost of care will go up, and patients will not be protected. Many of us on the Patients' Bill of Rights Task Force, many of my colleagues on the other side who fought for patients' rights and this side who fought for patients' rights have fought this battle.

Unfortunately, however, we can do no less. Many good points have been made in this debate, and I do not want to repeat them, but let me identify several that I do not think have been stressed adequately. First of all, the administration has been negotiating on this issue for over 14 months. We have had visits and consultations and briefings and high level ambassadors and conversations between the President and President Yeltsin and Vice President and former Prime Minister Chernomyrdin and so forth. Yet all we have really had is talk leading to talk. Talk needs to lead to action. Second, we have evidence that proliferation continues and that it may even be increasing. Third, we know that Russia, and this has been mentioned, has implemented a new executive decree in January which gives it added authority to crack down on those who transfer technology. It has not used this authority. In fact, in a case that the gentleman from Pennsylvania mentioned of technology transfers to Iraq, it specifically disregarded the fact that gyroscopes were transferred, called them scrap metal and took no action. So Russia is specifically failing to act even with new executive authority. Fourth, the United States already has adequate authority to act. In fact Vice President Gore, when he was a member of the other body, authored that authority, and yet the administration has failed to use it even with a concurrent resolution passed by both houses last fall, of which I was one of the authors, directing it to use that authority. So finally we come to this, the necessity to pass stronger legislation. I would point out, as we do this, and I predict we will do it by an overwhelming margin in just a moment, I would point out to the administration that there is still time in the intervening weeks between passing this bill and action that may be taken to override a veto, should the President make one, to get the administration to act and/or to get the Russian Government to act. We need action; we need these transfers stopped. There is time to do this. If the negotiations are ever to conclude, they should conclude now. We might view this bill as an opportunity. The Congress is taking this action so that the administration has no choice but to act and to cause our ally Russia to act as well. These transfers must stop now, or Israel, our allies in the region and our troops are at risk. Mr. Speaker, with the world still reeling from the explosion of nuclear devices by India and Pakistan, we must stand firm on our commitment to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Let's send a strong signal of our commitment to nonproliferation.

Mr. Chairman, we already had exhaustive debate on this issue, so I will attempt to be brief. First, though I would like to again correct what perhaps was a misstatement. My good friend, the gentleman from Minnesota, said, ``secret deals under protection of antitrust immunity.'' This legislation does not provide antitrust immunity for private contracts. We have said it several times. I hate to be repetitive. But the antitrust immunity only applies to where the tariffs are set. So again I emphasize that point. As a matter of fact, if anybody doubts it, read the bill. Second, the ability to negotiate private contracts with carriers was the bottom line in the compromise for all our U.S. shippers. Third, every other mode of transportation has this ability to negotiate private contracts. The airlines have it, the trucks have it, the rails have it. Every other mode has it except for ocean shipping. That is one of the fundamental reforms here which will create more competition. Again, while my dear friend stood up now and said how harmful this is going to be, less than a month ago he said, ``Shippers and consumers will pay less for their products. The ports will be handling more cargoes and the ocean carriers will have a more competitive operating environment.'' I recognize, as of last Friday night, things changed. And what changed, of course, was that some of the labor unions decided at the last minute to try to get another bite at the apple to oppose it. But it is important to emphasize that the seafarers, who are most directly affected by this legislation, support the bill as we bring it to the floor. Mr. Chairman, for all of those reasons, I will not belabor the point. We have debated it.","word.count":316,"sep11":-5.50280898876404,"years":1996.35674157303,"days":483,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.100901291542277,"Topic 2":0.00898102935085281,"Topic 3":0.0043482953791331,"Topic 4":0.636042383301842,"Topic 5":0.001301307366966,"Topic 6":0.00291014656685692,"Topic 7":0.00831638441937856,"Topic 8":0.0665256275900609,"Topic 9":0.16612395951114,"Topic 10":0.00454957497149222},{"id":"10419960048458","body":"Frank Murkowski: Mr. President, this amendment would simply end featherbedding in the Department of Agriculture relative to the process of seafood inspection as we know it today. I am especially concerned about the current regime for the canned salmon industry in the United States. As the Chair is well aware, a significant portion of that industry is based in my State of Alaska, and a good portion of that industry is controlled, through the State of Washington. As a consequence of the development of the industry over the years, there is an inspection program operated by the State of Alaska which meets all the criteria of the Federal Food and Drug Administration. This assures the consistent quality and wholesomeness of the salmon canned in Alaska. However, the USDA and only the USDA requires yet another, completely redundant layer of inspection, the cost of which is charged back to the canner. That means we have a situation where salmon going into the marketplace, going into the Safeway, going into Giant, going on the shelves of the grocers throughout the United States--is subject to an inspection that has been traditional in the industry involving both State and Federal oversight. However, for reasons unknown to the Senator from Alaska, the Department of Agriculture believes that what is good enough for the American salmon consumer is not good enough for the Federal programs that purchase this salmon with taxpayer dollars. So, the USDA demand that the salmon it purchases, available for our programs for the homeless and others, be inspected by an additional USDA inspector who must actually stand in the cannery at all times. This procedure is only required for salmon that goes into the USDA program. This is an additional cost to the Federal Government, and additional cost to the canner; additional cost, ultimately, to the consumer. It is really featherbedding. The USDA wants to keep Federal inspectors employed, even though they are not responsible for the safety of the salmon, and even though the commercial product sold in every grocery in the Nation is not subject to this continuous inspection. This particular amendment simply would alleviate this burden and no longer make necessary this inspection by the USDA. I might add, the inspection process as required by USDA often requires far more than just putting one inspector in each cannery. The canneries work well beyond an 8 to 5 day. They work when the fish are in, which requires in many cases a continuous 24-hour a day operation to ensure the quality of the pack. USDA's insistence is outdated. It has roots that are unfathomable. But the main issue is not its cause but its effect. The programs that protect the average consumer are necessary. They are appropriate. I support them. But it is not necessary nor is it appropriate for the Department of Agriculture to add an additional bureaucratic layer beyond the ones in place for you and me. As a consequence, Mr. President, I ask my colleagues, at the appropriate time, to consider adopting this amendment. I have discussed it with some of the floor managers. I do not know whether the Senator from Virginia has any interest in the subject or not. Mr. President, I will further offer an additional amendment which I will send to the desk. I ask the pending amendment be set aside.","word.count":556,"sep11":-5.6376404494382,"years":1996.22191011236,"days":435,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.222594026245854,"Topic 2":0.0855408200798615,"Topic 3":0.00934238800287904,"Topic 4":0.0550725328148208,"Topic 5":0.165913720623146,"Topic 6":0.0453047664585547,"Topic 7":0.183254141165383,"Topic 8":0.17454563016311,"Topic 9":0.0248395014915035,"Topic 10":0.0335924729548876},{"id":"10419960068525","body":"Tom Daschle: The majority leader raises the question on the floor, so I think it is important that I again reiterate to him for the Record that there was absolutely no desire on my part to avoid doing business, whatever the business may be.

I thank him for the opportunity to be his partner. I take some time this morning to address one of the important arguments made by our colleagues on the other side of this debate. Proponents of the legislation argue the only way to encourage broadband deployment is to provide subsidies to telecommunication industries with no strings attached. Furthermore, they argue the only way to create such subsidies is to pass a large, new, unfunded Federal mandate. I submit if what all of us here want to do is determine the taxes and spending policies of our State governments, then we should do what Senator Alexander did, what Senator Voinovich did, what Senator Hollings, I, and others did. We ran for Governor. We were elected. As a result we had the opportunity--in my case for 8 years--to decide what the taxing and spending policies of our States' governments should be. That is what we did. The authority we are granted here in the Senate by the Constitution is to decide the taxes and spending policies of the Federal Government, not the taxing and spending policies of the State governments, and not the spending and taxing policies of local governments. Our job is to determine the taxing and spending policies of the Federal Government. That being said, it is not as if we the Senate are somehow without the power to create incentives for industries to encourage certain activities we deem to be desirable. Senator Alexander mentioned a couple of areas where we are involved with tax policies in other cases and with spending policies to encourage the development of fuel cell vehicles, or to develop the creation of leaner burning diesel vehicles, or to incentivize creation of coal-fired plants that don't pollute a great deal. We have that spending and taxing authority, and we are using it--some would argue not to great effect, but that is our responsibility. We have the authority, after all, of a Federal budget. It is over $2 trillion. If we believe telecommunications companies need more money to build and market their broadband networks, and if we believe we can do better than the private sector in providing that money, then there are any number of ways we can provide money at the Federal level. After we do that, first of all, we could provide Federal grants. We can provide Federal tax breaks. We can provide loan guarantees. We can provide additional spectrum for unlicensed use. The only reason not to provide the money in these ways, if it is needed, is because Congress would have to find a way to pay for it rather than simply sending the bill to our friends in our State and local governments. If we pass a new unfunded mandate this week or next week, it will be a matter of choice rather than a matter of necessity. In case anyone doubts that, I would like to bring to the attention of our colleagues here in the Senate a few of the many bills that have been introduced in the Congress to create Federal incentives for broadband deployment. These bills have already been written. These bills have already been introduced. Many of them have a rather broad cosponsorship. If we wanted to, we could bring one or several of them to the floor today, debate them, and perhaps pass them. I will mention a number of those bills. I want to start first with bills that have been introduced by Senators who have joined us in opposing the unfunded Federal mandate we are debating here today. I do so because there has been some suggestion made by our colleague on the other side of this issue that those of us who oppose unfunded mandates also oppose the Internet, or oppose efforts to encourage the development of broadband. That is not true. While I doubt many of our colleagues believe this to be the case, I do believe it is important we clarify matters for the record. Let me start with a bill authored by Senator Hollings, a distinguished ranking member of the Commerce Committee. One year ago, Senator Hollings introduced the Broadband Deployment Act. It is a true Federal broadband bill, and as such it would be a much more appropriate piece of legislation for us to be debating here today. Instead of handing State and local governments an unfunded mandate, Senator Hollings' bill would provide broadband to support State and local broadband initiatives. Rather than being unfunded, Senator Hollings' proposal would be financed by moneys from the Federal telephone access tax. Besides block grants, Senator Hollings' bill would also provide direct grants for broadband deployment. It would also support university research on next-generation broadband technology and pilot projects deploying new wireless broadband technology. I think that sounds like a worthwhile proposal. However, for Senators who are opposed to providing outright grants, perhaps we should consider another proposal; that is, one by Senator Dorgan. His proposal is to make low-interest loans available to companies that are deploying broadband technologies in rural areas such as North Dakota. We have rural areas in Kentucky. There are rural areas in Tennessee. Believe it or not, we still have rural areas in Delaware. That proposal might be of some interest to a lot of us, and I suspect to other of our colleagues. On the other hand, if Senators would rather provide tax incentives and either grants or loans, then perhaps we should be debating Senator Rockefeller's Broadband Internet Access Act. Senator Rockefeller's legislation would provide tax credits for companies investing in broadband equipment. It would provide a 10-percent tax credit for investments in so-called ``current generation'' broadband services. For investment in higher speeds for next-generation broadband services, his bill would provide a 20-percent tax credit. If it is a Republican tax proposal my colleagues are looking for, we could always turn to Montana and Senator Burns' proposal to allow the expensing of broadband investments by companies. That might work. I find that attractive. If party affiliation is not the hangup, but Senators are uncomfortable with providing tax incentives directly to companies, perhaps they would prefer the approach suggested by our colleague from New York, Senator Clinton. She proposes a different approach. She proposes providing an income tax credit to holders of bonds that are used to finance the deployment of broadband technology. Finally, if Senators don't want to provide grants, loans, or tax incentives, they can consider an approach advocated by one of our colleagues who happens to represent, among other places in California, Silicon Valley; that is, Senator Boxer. Senator Boxer has proposed we allocate additional spectrum for unlicensed use by wireless broadband devices. Those are only a few of the proposals that have been made, introduced, discussed, and in some cases subject to hearings, and which have cosponsors. Those are a sampling of the things we can do as Federal legislators in a proactive way if we are interested in strengthening the ability of companies to market and extend their broadband systems. What I think this array of proposals indicates is there is no limit to the ways in which we could act, if we wanted to, to encourage broadband deployment at the Federal level. The Senators I have mentioned--I mentioned five of them--span the ideological spectrum, from liberal to conservative. They come from different parts of our country. Their proposals reflect their ideological diversity. Some would increase spending; others would cut taxes. Some would finance their proposals by reallocating existing resources; others would add to the deficit. But what is clear is all these proposals are harder to pass here in Washington than an unfunded mandate because we would have to pay the bill ourselves. We could not stick anyone else with the tab. We would have to pay the tab. Admittedly, at a time when our Federal budget deficit is out of control, I have to confess passing the buck does have a certain amount of appeal. But it is not as though State and local governments are in much better shape financially than we are. State and local governments are struggling to cope with the worst financial crisis they have faced, I am told, since World War II. Classrooms are becoming overcrowded as school budgets are cut. Prisoners are being released from jails as correction budgets are cut. Governors and mayors are pushing through unpopular and frequently regressive tax increases. New industry subsidies can be created for all sorts of wonderful purposes, but if they are conceived in Washington, and then the cost of those subsidies is passed on to State and local governments, what it all amounts to is political welfare. We spend, they pay. If we are going to pass on our costs to our friends in State and local governments, we ought to at the very least have the courtesy to tell them how much expense we are planning to run up on their tab. Perhaps the worst part about this new unfunded Federal mandate we are proposing is we cannot honestly look our Governors in the eye, we cannot honestly look our mayors in the eye, we cannot honestly look our State legislators in the eye, and even tell them how much this unfunded mandate is going to cost them and their State or their city or their county. We cannot do that because, in truth, we have no idea. I would ask how my colleagues would react to the following proposal from me: Suppose I proposed a bill to create new Federal subsidies for the poultry industry. The poultry industry is big in our State and the entire Delmarva Peninsula. In fact, for every person living in Delaware, there are 300 chickens. Let's say I proposed a bill to create new Federal subsidies for the poultry industry, or any industry, for that matt","word.count":774,"sep11":1.51123595505618,"years":2003.37078651685,"days":2980,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.150981611795659,"Topic 2":0.0297049901993689,"Topic 3":0.0093849243977009,"Topic 4":0.0683375763958879,"Topic 5":0.00498350195942515,"Topic 6":0.530668948635221,"Topic 7":0.00408810849485428,"Topic 8":0.183279104393311,"Topic 9":0.0123492722260929,"Topic 10":0.00622196150247939},{"id":"11020070028216","body":"Stevan Pearce: The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Mississippi that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5983, as amended.

With the increased emphasis on acquisition of theater missile defense systems, clearly justified by the imminent and expanding theater missile threat, the BMD technology budget has been squeezed to the point that built-in technical obsolescence of emerging BMD systems is a serious possibility. In effect, we are eating our seed corn. This amendment recognizes that because the BMD technology budget is dangerously close to an inadequate level, it is critically important that the dollars that are available are spent wisely. We must be vigilant to avoid duplication of effort and waste of funds on technologies of questionable priority. With all three services, and other agencies, spending BMD technology dollars on related areas of technology, the opportunities for duplication are clearly evident. Further screening and coordination of candidate technology tasks is urgently needed to assure that scarce technology funds are properly allocated. The U.S. Army Space and Strategic Command, an organization that has been at the forefront of BMD research and development for 40 years, is the ideal center for carrying out the necessary screening and coordination of BMD technology. Acting as executive agent to the BMD office, this organization can bring an unparalleled record of technical experience and performance excellence to this challenging coordination function. In the current BMD technology program, this organization is immersed in all of the critical BMD technologies and it has a core of engineers and scientists that can immediately assume a coordination role. It constitutes a ``smart buyer'' of BMD technology, proven over time, and it can contribute immensely to a more efficient utilization of the technology budget.","word.count":295,"sep11":-6.26123595505618,"years":1995.59831460674,"days":213,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.746514949327888,"Topic 2":0.0844070894213396,"Topic 3":0.0183637780457605,"Topic 4":0.0390154274246368,"Topic 5":0.0187238754093806,"Topic 6":0.0175150798849644,"Topic 7":0.0146157205104219,"Topic 8":0.0319025652509988,"Topic 9":0.0203689196321107,"Topic 10":0.00857259509249873},{"id":"10920060058055","body":"Dick Durbin: Mr. President, it has been my honor to serve on the Appropriations Committee and on this subcommittee.

Res. 1008, which condemns the Iranian Government's continuing persecution of members of the Baha'i faith, calls on Iran's Parliament to reject a proposed Islamic penal code, and calls on the Iranian regime to immediately release 10 imprisoned Baha'is. Mr. Speaker, Tehran's notoriously cruel regime, which denies religious freedoms to its citizens, has made a special example of the Iranian Baha'is. In addition to seizing Baha'i communal property, the Iranian Government prohibits the community from officially assembling, bans them from practicing or teaching their religion, excludes them from the national pension system and from public universities, prevents them from inheriting property, and jails them on account of their faith or on trumped-up charges of espionage. Recently, Iranian Baha'is have also reported a string of arson attacks against their homes and vehicles. Disturbingly, this persecution continues to the grave. In 2007, two Baha'i cemeteries in Iran were destroyed or bulldozed, wiping away the memory of these innocent Iranians. Mr. Speaker, oppression of Baha'is comes from the very top of the Iranian regime. The U.N.'s Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief has revealed that in 2005, the chairman of the command headquarters of Iran's Armed Forces wrote a letter stating that Iran's so-called ``supreme leader'' had ordered the headquarters to identify and monitor Iranian members of the Baha'i faith. This was no idle request. In March and May of 2008, the Government of Iran arrested and imprisoned seven senior leaders of the Baha'i community in Iran. And today, those leaders, along with three other Baha'is, remain imprisoned without charge. Now Iran's Parliament may aggravate repression of religious freedom by enacting a draft Islamic penal code that would punish so-called ``apostates,'' including all Baha'is and converts from Islam, with death. Iran's regime continues to demonstrate that it is ready and willing to execute innocent people. Mr. Speaker, totalitarian regimes everywhere, hiding behind the false excuse of state sovereignty, are eager to combat any progress in human rights and freedoms and to expand their hegemony and repression as far as others allow them to do. Therefore, the United States must continue to make clear, in both word and deed, that the spread of religious freedom and human rights worldwide is not merely an ideal, but an imperative. I thank my distinguished colleague and friend from Illinois for introducing this resolution.

First, the trade deficit. The Washington Post reported on February 16 that our trade deficit reached a record $489 billion in 2003. The story said that ``while the trade report showed the robust growth in U.S. consumption, it also provided a stark reminder of problems on the economy's productive side. In particular, the lack of employment growth which is attributable in part to the loss of jobs to foreign competition.'' At a hearing before the subcommittee I chair, the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment, the head of the World Shipping Council said ships were coming to the U.S. full but leaving empty. We cannot sustain this type of deficit for many more years. By far the largest trade imbalance is with China and will probably be around $150 billion this year. With a tiny bit less than 4 percent of the world's population, we buy 25 percent of the world's goods. This means that every other country desperately wants into our markets. We have tremendous trade leverage that we have not used as we should have. It has been used mainly to help large multinational companies which have had great influence, too much influence, in our government. However, our trade agreements have been detrimental to the majority of American small and medium-sized businesses and to our workers. I believe other countries are probably amazed that we have not been tougher in trade negotiations. We should tell any nation with which we have a large trade imbalance, starting with China, that we want to be friends, that we want cultural and educational exchanges, tourism, and especially trade; but we want that trade to be both free and fair. We should tell the Chinese and others to start looking for products they can buy from us because if they do not start bringing down the trade deficits within a reasonable time, we will have to renegotiate some of our trade agreements. William Hawkins, Senior Fellow, at the U.S. Business and Industry Council, summed it up best in a recent column in the Washington Times: ``Commerce is driven by competition, making trade rivalry a part of the larger struggle of nations for independence, security, and prosperity.'' Mr. Speaker, I am sick and tired of seeing so many millions of American jobs going to other countries, and there is tremendous concern about this all across this Nation. Secondly, Mr. Speaker, gas prices. Gas prices have risen to some of their highest levels ever, primarily for two reasons: one, we are being robbed by foreign oil producers; and, two, extreme environmentalists oppose any oil production in the U.S. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is a 19.8 million acre site, 35 times the size of the Great Smokey Mountains. Yet some left-wing extremists oppose drilling on some 2,000 acres in the Arctic Nation Wildlife Refuge, about \\1/100\\ of 1 percent of the refuge, in a part that is a frozen tundra with no trees or bushes for many, many miles. We have not opened a new oil refinery since 1975, and something like 36 have been forced to close since 1980 due to too many rules and regulations. If we do not, Mr. Speaker, we will become even more vulnerable to foreign nations and damage both our economy and our national security. These environmental extremists almost always come from very wealthy or upper-income families, and perhaps they do not realize how much they are hurting the poor and the lower-income and the working people of this country, but we need to produce more U.S. oil to bring down these gas prices.","word.count":168,"sep11":1.59831460674157,"years":2003.45786516854,"days":3011,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0141900211033935,"Topic 2":0.08602603568621,"Topic 3":0.458042356588007,"Topic 4":0.0118690974379051,"Topic 5":0.0134145617334364,"Topic 6":0.0421403322984197,"Topic 7":0.0117639237107012,"Topic 8":0.019157956912698,"Topic 9":0.338976018818098,"Topic 10":0.00441969571113073},{"id":"10820030086038","body":"Ted Stevens: Mr. President, I said before and I say again, the war is over.

The Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and Courts, which is chaired by Senator Grassley, and upon which I serve as ranking member has just concluded a hearing on Wednesday, August 2, 1995, relative to the Conference's reauthorization. At that hearing a panel of distinguished witnesses testified on behalf of the continued authorization for this small, but vital independent agency whose purpose is to promote the efficiency, adequacy, and fairness by which Federal agencies conduct regulatory programs, administer grants and benefits, and perform related government functions. The witnesses who testified before our subcommittee were the Hon. Thomasina Rogers, chairwoman of the Conference, the Hon. Loren Smith, chief judge of the Court of Federal Claims and a former chairman of the Conference, Thomas Susman, a prominent Washington lawyer and former staff member of the Judiciary Committee, and James Miller III, former Director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Ronald Reagan. That is quite a cross-section of individuals and reflect the broadbased, non-ideological support that the Conference enjoys by the legal and academic community across the nation. We are living in a time of retrenchment, when the Federal Government is cutting back and trying to do more with less. The question we must ask ourselves as policy makers is ``does eliminating the Conference make good common sense''? I believe the answer is ``no'' and will elaborate today on why it is good policy to continue the valuable work this agency performs on behalf of the American taxpayer. Former OMB Director Jim Miller put it succinctly at the hearing when he asked: ``Does the Conference produce value for money''? That is ``putting the hay down where the goats can eat it,'' as we say back in Alabama. First let me share some background with my colleagues who may not be familiar with the work that the Conference does. As I have mentioned, the Conference seeks to improve the fairness, adequacy, and efficiency of the regulatory process with a unique combination of public and private cooperation between government officials and private citizens who volunteer their time and expertise. The Conference has leveraged its rather modest $1.8 million appropriation with hundreds of thousands of dollars of estimated donated time from private citizens to conduct the necessary work to advise the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the Federal Government. The Conference was established by law in 1964 to make recommendations on needed improvements to the regulatory process and to serve as sort of a clearinghouse for all of the Federal agencies in this regard. We in Congress have given the agency additional statutory duties over the years under the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act, the Negotiated Rulemaking Act, and the recently enacted Congressional Accountability Act, and the proposed Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act. Let me give you a concrete example. Under the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act, the Conference has assisted in carrying out the act's goals of cutting down on unnecessary Government litigation when cheaper and quicker alternatives could be used to the benefit of the Government and the taxpayer. The Conference instituted a computerized roster that now contains the names of hundreds of neutral mediators who are available to assist agencies in resolving their problems. The Conference has also sponsored an initiative which allows agencies to use each other's employees as an alternate source of low cost, high quality mediators. And importantly, the Conference organized a series of interagency working groups bringing together people from dozens of agencies to work cooperatively on projects no one agency would likely undertake on its own.","word.count":618,"sep11":-6.26123595505618,"years":1995.59831460674,"days":213,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0194526376766323,"Topic 2":0.200688417576482,"Topic 3":0.00430585414228328,"Topic 4":0.0736644461033127,"Topic 5":0.00482755874167008,"Topic 6":0.567682088064665,"Topic 7":0.0334106053162046,"Topic 8":0.0386842739324676,"Topic 9":0.0116906570680114,"Topic 10":0.0455934613782705},{"id":"11020070065708","body":"Joseph I.

Breast cancer is so pervasive that it touches every American family. The diagnosis of breast cancer is frightening enough not to have to fight the insurance companies, as has been said before. One in eight women is going to be diagnosed with breast cancer during her lifetime, and it remains the number one cause of death in women between the ages of 30 and 54. In my congressional district, there are almost 1,500 instances of breast cancer and nearly 300 women die every year. And rushing a woman through a hospital stay after a mastectomy and pressuring her to return to her normal life almost immediately hampers her recovery. That is why it is imperative that we pass the Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act. We must also support research into better breast cancer detection methods. Mammographies, which is the only tool we have had for 40 years, miss too many women and cannot suffice as our gold standard. But instead of passing legislation to stop drive-through mastectomies or supporting funding increases for research and development, we have become a drive-through Congress, rushing to pass what is politically divisive.

It includes: grants for targeted drug development; creating ``cancer quarterbacks'' in Medicare; Medicaid coverage for smoking cessation treatments; pilot projects for expanding colorectal cancer screening in underserved populations; continued research into the possible benefits of early detection for lung cancer; loan repayment assistance for cancer prevention researchers; incentives for research into drugs that prevent cancer from developing and spreading in the first place; provisions to promote the collection and storage of tissue sample, to give researchers the tools they need to use genomic research to create individualized cures; promoting access to clinical trials, as well as investigational therapies for those who are terminally ill; addressing the health needs of the growing number of cancer survivors. Just over 35 years ago, President Nixon signed into law the original National Cancer Act, creating the National Cancer Institute and making cancer research a priority of the Federal Government. This work has led to tremendous breakthroughs against cancer, including innovative drugs, treatments, and a better understanding of the factors that lead to cancer in the first place. Last year, death rates decreased for 11 of the 15 cancers most common in men, and 10 of the cancers most common in women. Sixty-five percent of people diagnosed with cancer can now expect to survive at least 5 years. This is good news. But it is not enough. The cost of cancer, in both human and economic terms, remains staggering. An estimated 1,399,790 Americans were diagnosed with some form of cancer last year. Approximately 1 of 3 women will develop cancer at some point in her lifetime; for men, the risk is slightly less than 1 in 2. The National Institutes of Health estimated the overall cost of cancer in 2005 at $209.9 billion. The price of inaction is too steep. Cancer is, first and foremost, a disease of aging. About 76 percent of cancer cases are diagnosed in patients at age 55 or older. If no fundamental changes are made, the aging of the Baby Boom generation will bring a 20 percent increase in cancer diagnoses. In the face of these challenges, the National Cancer Institute, NCI, with broad support in the cancer community, set the ambitious goal of ending death and suffering from cancer by 2015. This goal has generated unprecedented excitement and unity, with over 80 Members of the United States Senate signing a letter in support of the effort. It is time to reexamine and reorient our Nation's cancer policy to meet this ambitious goal. This does not mean that cancer will be eradicated by 2015. As our population ages, cancer will not go away. But we can change the meaning of a cancer diagnosis, and that is what the 2015 goal is about. Meeting this goal will take a comprehensive approach. It requires detecting cancer earlier, before it spreads and becomes harder to treat. It requires targeted therapies, capable of killing cancer cells while leaving healthy cells intact. We must provide access to high quality cancer care for those who do get sick. We must also understand more about why people get cancer in the first place, and ways it can be prevented. Our legislation takes a multifaceted approach to changing the very nature of a cancer diagnosis. The National Cancer Act of 2007 will do the following: Authorize grants for the development of targeted drugs. New drug therapies continue to lead us closer to the day in which cancer is a treatable, chronic condition controlled with a simple pill or injection. It has now been 5 years since the drug company Novartis won approval for Gleevec, a targeted drug that has saved the lives of countless patients with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, CML. Gleevec demonstrates the promise of this new kind of drug therapy. It blocks the enzymes that help cancer cells grow and divide, leaving healthy cells untouched. When this drug was first introduced, CML patients who were near death recovered and left the hospital. Yet it could not be determined if their remission would last, or if long-term use of this revolutionary drug would prove safe. We now know that Gleevec is fulfilling this early promise. Before the advent of this drug, CML patients would often suffer a relapse after 2 or 3 years. But a recent study of CML patients taking Gleevec has demonstrated a remarkable 89 percent survival rate after 5 years. The cancer progressed to a more serious stage in only 7 percent of patients during this time period, and only 5 percent were forced to discontinue treatment because of side effects. These results suggest that patients may be able to stay on Gleevec indefinitely, keeping this formerly deadly cancer under control while leading full and productive lives. Targeted therapies are now offering hope to patients with many different kinds of cancer: Herceptin for some breast cancers, Iressa for those with small cell lung cancer, Avastin for colorectal cancer. Avastin can extend survival by interfering with the growth of blood vessels that feed the tumor, literally starving it. These drugs are the future of cancer research. We need more drugs like Gleevec, which transform cancer from a killer to a controllable health condition. This legislation would authorize NCI to make grants to further develop these treatments. To help with the development of targeted drugs, the bill also calls for the establishment of a task force on surrogate endpoints and biomarkers. They are the mechanisms for measuring the efficacy of cancer treatment at the molecular level, allowing doctors to precisely gauge how a patient is reacting to a treatment, or if a cancer is progressing. Developing biomarkers for different types of cancer is an essential step, and our bill will establish a program to develop the biomarkers with the most immediate clinical promise. The bill will also create special reimbursements for coordinating physicians, or ``cancer quarterbacks'' in Medicare. Successful cancer treatment is increasingly complex, reaching across the entire spectrum of the medical profession. It can involve lab tests, CT-scans, surgery, chemotherapy, and a full team of specialists who offer this care. Many patients have no single physician who can guide them through the complicated and sometimes contradictory course of cancer treatment, no professional to advise them what is best. This bill would require Medicare to pay oncology doctors or nurses to become the overall managers of patients' care, in effect providing every cancer patient with a ``cancer quarterback'' physician to help them coordinate care and make the necessary decisions. This cancer quarterback can direct care in the manner that best meets the patient's needs, instead of focusing on only a small segment of his or her care. This legislation requires that State Medicaid drug programs cover smoking cessation treatments in the same manner as all other approved therapies. I have long believed that we will not truly address the burden of cancer until we address tobacco use. I have asked all kinds of cancer experts about what we can do to stop death from cancer, and their answer is always the same: Stop tobacco use. Tobacco causes 30 percent of cancer deaths and 1 in 5 of all deaths in the United States. It is the leading cause of preventable death. Smoking related costs total $167 billion annually. According to the CDC, more than 70 percent of American smokers would like to quit. Studies indicate that tobacco use treatment, including smoking cessation aids, will double their chances of success. Yet under current law, State Medicaid programs are exempted from providing coverage of smoking cessation agents in the same way as they provide coverage of other drugs. Other exemptions include fertility treatments, drugs to promote hair growth, and drugs for erectile dysfunction. Simply put, smoking cessation aids, which are FDA approved and proven to be effective, do not belong on this list. Denying people access to treatments to help them break a deadly and expensive addiction is flawed policy. Our bill will remove tobacco cessation products from this list of exemptions, leveling the playing field with other FDA approved products. Our bill establishes pilot projects for expanding colorectal cancer screening for low-income, uninsured individuals. The Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program has proven very successful in providing low income women with access to potentially life saving screenings. It is now time to provide similar access to colorectal cancer screening. The need is great. A 2006 study conducted by Northwestern University researchers found that only 7 percent of minority patients without regular health care access at risk for developing colon cancer are being screened. A 2005 study of New York City residents found that those least likely to have been recommended colorectal screening are low- income or uninsured. Early detection allows physicians to identify patients with pre- cancerous polyps, and treat them before cancer even develops. These pilot projects identify the best ways to provide access to this lifesaving care for those who are not currently receiving recommended screenings. This bill will authorize continued research on the potential of CT scans to detect lung cancer early. before it becomes fatal. Despite all the promising advances against many types of cancer, lung cancer remains the Nation's leading cause of cancer death in both men and women. About 20,000 people who have never smoked are diagnosed with lung cancer each year, and this number is increasing. We need to learn more about how to screen for lung cancer and detect it early, before it has advanced. There is much we need to learn before scientists can make a definitive recommendation about screenin","word.count":2473,"sep11":5.68820224719101,"years":2007.54775280899,"days":4467,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0470341936271468,"Topic 2":0.312017101807303,"Topic 3":0.019071749542432,"Topic 4":0.00284363354088986,"Topic 5":0.0515709704107844,"Topic 6":0.410595162315148,"Topic 7":0.148172326424513,"Topic 8":0.00335713459040092,"Topic 9":0.0042771519207518,"Topic 10":0.00106057582063022},{"id":"10820040030178","body":"Maxine Waters: Mr. Chairman, if anyone had told me that coming to the Congress of the United States of America, representing my district, I would have to be on the floor of Congress defending the constitutional rights of the Supreme Court to make constitutional rulings, I would have told them they are crazy.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation, H.R. 4579, that would ratify an agreement reached May 30 between Interior Secretary Babbitt and Utah Governor Levitt to exchange Federal and State lands in the West Desert of Utah. Such legislation is necessary because the proposed exchange does not comply with the requirements of the Federal Land Policy Management Act and other applicable law. The agreement between the Secretary and the Governor has only recently been finalized, and the hearing held by the Committee on Resources raised several questions. Fortunately, I think we have been able to address the questions that were raised with respect to appraisal of these lands and the process by which the BLM went through this and raised concerns about the general, if you will, BLM appraisal process with respect to land exchanges. Clearly here the worry was that valuation methods were used that had no basis in law or policy and could not stand up to the appraisal standards. But I think the fact of the matter is that while that process was far from ideal, I think also we have a unique situation here in the sense that there is a benefit in this exchange, especially in the fact that we will have the opportunity to consolidate Federal land holdings in many wilderness study areas and other lands found to have significant wilderness qualities, and I think that is important. So some of these lands in and of them themselves may not have great value, but in terms of management and the consolidation impact, I think that clearly this exchange is needed, and I believe the bill now contains provisions that will provide reasonable process for assessing the value of the proposed land exchange before it is implemented. The language provides that the Secretary and the State of Utah will each prepare a statement of value for the lands to be exchanged. In addition, the two parties will select an independent qualified appraiser who will review those statements of values and all relevant documentation to determine if the lands are of approximately equal value. I think this in fact will make the bill acceptable. I really want to thank the sponsor of this legislation, the gentleman from Utah , for all of the effort that he has put into this legislation to address these concerns. I think it is clearly a bill that the House should now support.

I am concerned that promoting English as the official Government language in this particular way will result in situations where Americans not yet completely proficient in English will be disadvantaged when it comes to seeking and receiving vital assistance from Government--be it exercising their right to vote, receiving the fullest education possible, health issues, particularly emergency situations--or any other social services. My strong preference is to look at this issue from another angle. There is no question that English is a language of opportunity and that it is practical to carry out as much government business as possible in this language. In practice this is the case already--the GAO reported recently that between 1990-1994 Federal agencies, other than Defense and State, published 265 documents in languages other than English-- less than 1 percent of all the government documents reviewed by the GAO. In reality, about 97 percent of U.S. residents above the age of 4 speak English well or very well. It is the 3 or 4 percent of our population that needs assistance when communicating in English that I am concerned about. Rather than passing legislation which promotes the use of English in a way that can be perceived as exclusive, culturally insensitive and which may result in further marginalization of minorities. I agree with others who have suggested we should instead focus on encouraging all Americans to become proficient in English-- through making English language programmers fully accessible to all. It is not socially responsible to pass legislation such as H.R. 123 and expect those who cannot communicate in English--often not because they lack the will to try but because they are simply not enough programmes to go around--to cope without any means of communication with Government, which is after all there to serve the people. I strongly urge my colleagues to focus instead on strengthening our capacity to provide the means for new immigrants and those struggling to learn English to do so. My second specific concern related to this legislation is an uneasy sensation I have that there are darker political undertones to the desire to promote the use of English only. The legislation is worded in such a way that it appears to be promoting English very much at the expense of other languages. The legislation does not recognize sufficiently the important of multiculturalism in the history of this country, and the strength multilingualism brings to our country today and its place in the emerging global marketplace. I bring to this debate a unique perspective in that I represent a district where the languages of every day transaction are English and Samoan. Bilingualism is a strength in my constituency and I cannot support legislation that does not adequately recognize this. Finally, I would like to note that moves afoot in this Congress to declare English as the official language of the United States have attracted the attention of the international community. I refer particularly to a resolution passed by the fourth Polynesian language forum, held in New Zealand in August last year which was supported by government representatives of 13 governments of Polynesia including New Zealand, Cook Islands, French Polynesia, Easter island, Western Samoa, Fiji, and Tonga. The resolution specifically stated its incredulity that the United States, otherwise a world leader in the field of human rights, should even consider legislation such as this. The resolution also reminds us that the international community recognizes the rights of indigenous people to have their languages used officially in government. In addition to the points I have made above in relation to the effect of this legislation on all minority groups in the U.S. this Congress would be wise to reflect upon its obligations to protect the languages and cultures of Native American peoples. We should not forget that the international community is watching, and judging us by our actions.","word.count":671,"sep11":-5.24438202247191,"years":1996.61516853933,"days":575,"party":"Other","chamber":"","Topic 1":0.0211124588431097,"Topic 2":0.254752791828448,"Topic 3":0.269514369293542,"Topic 4":0.0105730426784647,"Topic 5":0.157726941315734,"Topic 6":0.0888859776507013,"Topic 7":0.0460949636417985,"Topic 8":0.0125677660913617,"Topic 9":0.133125692846607,"Topic 10":0.00564599581023399},{"id":"10920060017668","body":"John Boehner: As the gentleman knows, I do several media events every week where members of the press routinely ask me every Tuesday and every Thursday the same question, and as you know, this is a very difficult issue.

Senator Byrd's record and achievements have been covered by the majority leader and the Democratic leader. I would like to make a few different observations. When Senator Byrd came to this body in 1959, he was a member of a very large Democratic class. His party had had a very good day. It was the second term of President Eisenhower. In his class were such people as Eugene McCarthy and Tom Dodd and Phil Hart. Lyndon Baines Johnson was the leader of his party in the Senate at the time. In fact, Senator Byrd was accompanied to the well on his first day in office not by the senior Senator from his State, as is tradition, but by Majority Leader Johnson, his future mentor. Shortly before the distinguished Senator from West Virginia got here, Majority Leader Johnson had appointed a committee to pick out the five greatest United States Senators in history. John F. Kennedy was appointed to be the head of that committee. After due deliberation, they picked out five Senators: Henry Clay from my State of Kentucky, Daniel Webster, John C. Calhoun, Robert La Follette, and Robert Taft. Those five Senators, who were designated as the five greatest Senators of all time, are depicted out here off the Senate Chamber in the waiting room. Six or 8 years ago, we decided to consider adding two more to the list. I had the opportunity to be on a committee that reviewed the possibility of adding two more. We concluded there were two more who should be added, one Democrat and one Republican. Our colleagues on the Democratic side picked Robert Wagner of New York, who was the author of most of President Roosevelt's New Deal legislation. After due deliberation, the Republicans on the committee, of which I was one, concluded that Arthur Vandenberg was the appropriate selection for us, based upon his willingness in the late 1940s to make the Truman containment policy, the Marshall plan, and other initiatives at the beginning of the Cold War that basically set out the strategy that we followed until the Berlin Wall came down in 1989. We thought that Arthur Vandenberg would be the appropriate one for us. So two more Senators were added--Arthur Vandenberg and Robert Wagner. Today I think it is safe to predict that some day in the future, some Senate will decide to revisit the issue of what other great Senators might be added to this pantheon off the Senate floor that now includes seven United States Senators in our history. I think I can confidently predict that near the top of the list, if not at the top of the list, some day down the road will be the distinguished Senator from West Virginia. Mr. President, today, June 12, 2006, is our good friend from West Virginia's 17,327th day in the Senate, making him the longest-serving Senator ever. Senator Robert C. Byrd's first day as a Senator was January 3, 1959, when he was 41 years old. He is the 1,579th Senator. Some of his contemporaries were John Sherman Cooper, Hubert Humphrey, Everett Dirksen, John F. Kennedy, and Richard Russell. Over his nearly 50 years of service here--he has been elected to eight full terms--Senator Byrd has served with 405 Senators, out of a total of 1,885 Senators who ever served. That is 21.5 percent of the total number. Over a fifth of all Senators who ever served can say they served with Senator Byrd. And I add that Senator Byrd is only the second Senator ever to be elected to eight full terms. As the Senators from two coal-producing States, Senator Byrd and I have worked together on a number of issues over the years to ensure that coal remains a safe, cheap, and plentiful source of energy, and that coal miners and their families can continue in this industry. Together we ensured that the Capitol complex would continue to be heated by coal. And we work together as members of the Appropriations Committee. I thank the Senator for his friendship over the years. As astounding as the Senator from West Virginia's service in this body is, I must point out that he has even more experience representing the people of West Virginia. Senator Byrd served in the West Virginia House of Delegates from 1947 to 1950, the West Virginia Senate from 1951 to 1952, and the U.S. House of Representatives from 1953 to 1959. He was elected to his first office in 1946. He was also elected assistant majority whip here in the Senate in 1965. In 1971, he was elected majority whip. I have heard that can be a tough job. In 1977, Senator Byrd succeeded Senator Mike Mansfield as majority leader. He has also served as minority leader and Senate President pro tempore, meaning he has held every major position in the Senate. After serving as majority and minority leader, Senator Byrd became chairman of the Appropriations Committee in 1989, and has been chairman or ranking member ever since. Our colleague from Alaska, the current Senate President pro tempore, has served with him on that committee since 1973. Senator Byrd set the record for number of Senate votes cast at 12,134 on April 27, 1990, breaking a record set by Senator William Proxmire. He cast his 17,000th vote in March 2004, and continues to set the record every time he votes. As of the opening of the Senate today, he has cast 17,666 votes. As his constituents in West Virginia know so well, Senator Byrd is the son of a coal miner. Before government service, he worked as a welder in wartime shipyards and as a meat cutter in a coal company town. Senator Byrd is also an expert on Senate history. He wrote, with the assistance of Senate historian Richard Baker, a four-volume collection of history, speeches and statistics titled ``The Senate'' 1789-1989. He also wrote a history called ``The Senate of the Roman Republic,'' and a 2005 autobiography titled ``Child of the Appalachian Coalfields.'' And my good friend from West Virginia is an accomplished fiddle player as well. He has performed on the television variety show ``Hee Haw,'' at the Grand Ole Opry, and at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. He even recorded an album called ``Mountain Fiddler.'' Senator Byrd earned his law degree from American University in 1963, while serving in the Senate. He attended night school while doing a full day's work here. President Kennedy presented him with his diploma and gave the commencement address. President Kennedy received an honorary degree from American University at the ceremony. So he began his commencement address with these words: In 1994, Senator Byrd was awarded his B.A. summa cum laude by Marshall University, which he had attended for one semester in 1951. He had earned A's in all his classes, but could not afford to continue. So he actually received his law degree before his bachelor's. Senator Byrd is the first West Virginian in history to win all 55 of that State's counties in a statewide race. I am sure many of his fellow West Virginians know of his knowledge and reverence for the Constitution, and that he always carries a copy in his left breast pocket. Senator Byrd's legacy in this body is felt every day. Martin Gold, author of ``Senate Procedure and Practice,'' wrote: And Michael Barone, in The Almanac of American Politics, said this of Senator Byrd: Now, these comments from scholars are certainly to be respected. But I think Senator Byrd said it best at a spirited rally near the end of one of his recent campaigns for office. Senator Byrd said: Mr. President, Senator Byrd would be the first to tell us he could not have accomplished all he has without the love of his life, his partner, and his best friend--his wife, Erma Ora James Byrd. Erma passed away this March, 2 months shy of what would have been their 69th wedding anniversary. The daughter of a coal miner, today would have been her 89th birthday. I am sure she is watching down on us from Heaven today as we honor her husband, the Senator from West Virginia. Stories of enduring love are part of the history of any nation. Robert and Erma were made for each other, and were together for nearly 69 years. Mr. President, I believe they are one of our Nation's great love stories. I say to my friend and colleague from West Virginia, no one has had a greater career here. Your service is of great distinction. We all admire you very much, and we are here today to honor you on this most important occasion. I yield the floor.","word.count":1500,"sep11":4.87359550561798,"years":2006.73314606742,"days":4177,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.155573280650667,"Topic 2":0.0220015379682999,"Topic 3":0.375215664956385,"Topic 4":0.00807496119772631,"Topic 5":0.322688349778939,"Topic 6":0.00570766744183164,"Topic 7":0.0214981043866908,"Topic 8":0.0509052961890744,"Topic 9":0.00384629505155672,"Topic 10":0.034488842378829},{"id":"10419960085574","body":"Byron Dorgan: Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation which will fairly resolve a longstanding problem with respect to a judgment distribution to Sioux tribes in the Dakotas and Montana. Specifically, the bill would distribute the accrued interest on funds awarded by the Indian Claims Commission in 1967 to the Mississippi Sioux tribes. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Daschle and Pressler in introducing this measure. In 1972, Congress enacted legislation that authorized the Secretary of the Interior to distribute 75 percent of a $5,900,000 judgment award to the Devils Lake Sioux Tribe of North Dakota, the Sisseton and Wahpeton Sioux Tribe of North and South Dakota, and the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck Reservation in Montana. The remaining 25 percent was to be distributed to individuals who could trace their lineal ancestry to a member of the aboriginal Sisseton and Wahpeton Sioux Tribe. The three Sioux tribes received their respective shares of the judgment award by the mid-1970's. To date, though, the funds allocated for the lineal descendants have never been distributed. This has resulted in a situation where the accrued interest on the original principal of approximately $1.5 million has now grown to more than $13 million. If the 1,969 lineal descendants identified by the Department of the Interior receive per capita payments, they would receive more than 18 times what the 11,829 enrolled tribal members received in the 1970's. In 1987, the three Sioux tribes filed suit in Federal court to challenge the constitutionality of the lineal descendancy provisions of the 1972 Act. This litigation is currently in its second appeal. In 1992, Congress enacted legislation which authorized the Attorney General to settle the case on any terms agreed to by the parties involved. However, the Department of Justice has refused to proceed with any settlement negotiations and has taken the position that the 1992 law did not authorize the Department to settle the case on any terms other than those laid out in the original 1972 act. While I believe this interpretation flies in the face of congressional intent, the Department has been unwilling to actively pursue this issue. The legislation I am introducing on behalf of the three Sioux tribes represents a reasonable solution to this matter and a substantial compromise on behalf of the tribes. In the past, the tribes have sought to repeal the lineal descendancy provisions of the 1972 act altogether, and, in 1986, a bill was reported by the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs which would have achieved this goal. In contrast, the Mississippi Sioux Tribes Judgment Fund Distribution Act of 1996 would retain the undistributed principal for the lineal descendants and distribute the accrued interest to the three Sioux tribes. There would be no per capita payments of the interest, which would have to be used by the tribes for economic development, resource development, or for other programs that collectively benefit tribal members, such as educational and social welfare programs. In addition, the legislation contains an audit requirement by the Secretary of the Interior to ensure that the funds are properly managed. I believe that this legislation is fundamentally fair. It keeps the commitment that the Federal Government made to provide compensation to lineal descendants while ensuring that most of the remaining undistributed funds go to the tribes. It was, after all, the tribes who were wronged and who should be compensated for their losses. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:","word.count":599,"sep11":-5.07584269662921,"years":1996.78370786517,"days":635,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.166422172570502,"Topic 2":0.426603404083283,"Topic 3":0.0157077180648005,"Topic 4":0.0760510029540469,"Topic 5":0.254583714100071,"Topic 6":0.0170267897073946,"Topic 7":0.00889380771704844,"Topic 8":0.0173531539273145,"Topic 9":0.00594786869036103,"Topic 10":0.0114103681851768},{"id":"10920050048885","body":"Susan Collins: Mr. President, when American workers go to work every day, they expect to go into a workplace that is safe and secure.

Drugs and violence simply do not belong in our schools. Our teachers and children are entitled to a safe learning environment, free from weapons and illicit narcotics. Time and again at the Columbine High School in Colorado; in Jonesboro, Arkansas; and in my home State, at Heath High School in Paducah, Kentucky, shocking acts of violence have been planned and unfortunately executed in our schools. Last week in Green Bay, Wisconsin, the situation turned out differently. Local law enforcement reacting to information gathered by school officials were able to thwart an attack being planned by high school students and save lives. The National Center for Education statistics found in 2003, the last year for which we have statistics, 17 percent of students in grades 9 through 12 reported having carried a weapon; 9 percent of students reported having been threatened or injured with a weapon, such as a gun, knife, or club, on school property. During the same period, 29 percent of students have been offered drugs on school grounds within the previous 12 months. My friends, these numbers are simply unacceptable. The presence of drugs or weapons in a classroom is not conducive to a productive learning environment. Metal detectors have become a fact of life in many of our schools. Despite that fact, weapons are still appearing in our classrooms. When I was a child in school, no one doubted who had control of the classroom. Teachers were clear in their ability to control their learning environment. Today, we have the opportunity to restore some of that clarity. I am a firm believer in our Constitution and our Bill of Rights, and I take my oath of office to defend those rights very seriously. This legislation is simple. This act does not issue a blank check to anyone to conduct random, unfounded, or mass searches. It does not change the fourth amendment standards on search and seizure. In fact, it is the parents and school officials who are empowered by this legislation. These men and women will work together in individual communities across the Nation to develop school safety policies that suit the unique needs of their teachers and students and are based on the constitutional standards set by the Supreme Court. Nothing more, nothing less. H.R. 5295 requires local education agencies to have policies in place that adopt a standard articulated by the Supreme Court in New Jersey v. T.L.O. This standard allows teachers and school officials to use their experience and judgments to make decisions that will help control their classrooms and protect the students. Our schools and classrooms should be safe places, free from drugs and weapons; and safety should not be a luxury. Parents should be confident in the safety of their children at school. Children should be able to focus on their studies without fear; teachers and school officials should be confident in their judgment and ability to control school property. I am very proud of the work that we have done with the National Education Association to improve the language of H.R. 5295 since its original introduction, and I am even more pleased that the National Education Association has endorsed this legislation as a positive step toward a safer learning environment for teachers and students throughout our schools. A special thank you is due to Chairman McKeon and his staff for their assistance. I would especially like to recognize the work of three staffers, Joanna Glaze, Taylor Hansen and James Bergeron. I urge all my colleagues to support this simple, commonsense legislation to provide our students and teachers with a safer, more productive learning environment.","word.count":619,"sep11":5.15168539325843,"years":2007.01123595506,"days":4276,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0274365994492932,"Topic 2":0.465698600953532,"Topic 3":0.053120167895053,"Topic 4":0.00477839992768459,"Topic 5":0.0150171806987592,"Topic 6":0.330329223837296,"Topic 7":0.00447440240275493,"Topic 8":0.0142901750249879,"Topic 9":0.0627111233365538,"Topic 10":0.022144126474085},{"id":"10519980056056","body":"Barbara Mikulski: Mr. President, I rise in firm opposition to S. Con Res. 86, the Budget Resolution for fiscal year 1999. I do so with great disappointment. Mr. President, last year the Congress produced an historic budget agreement. We produced a plan to finish the job we started in 1993 of eliminating the budget deficit. We worked together--across party lines--to balance the budget, to protect our seniors by ensuring the solvency of Medicare, and to provide for key investments in education and health care. We also provided real tax relief for working families. I had hoped we would be able to continue to build off the framework of the 1997 Balanced Budget Act and Taxpayer Relief Act. Unfortunately, this budget resolution ignores the priorities that were at the core of those agreements. I will oppose this resolution because it does not reflect the principles and priorities that I believe must be part of the budget. I want a budget that preserves the safety net for seniors, gets behind our kids, provides for safe streets and a safer world, and provides for investments in science and technology. I believe this budget is defective in each of these areas. The Democratic budget alternative that was offered during our debate was strong where this resolution is deficient. It would have allowed for enactment of a comprehensive child care initiative to improve and expand the availability of quality, affordable child care and after school programs for school age children. No working parent should have to worry about finding suitable care for their child--a safe place with well-trained staff. The lack of adequate safe and affordable child care is a major concern of America's families. Our alternative would have gone a long way to meet that critical need. The Democratic alternative was strong on education. It would have enabled us to improve the education of our children through initiatives to reduce classroom size, hire 100,000 more teachers, and to ensure that children attend school in safe and well-maintained facilities. Our Democratic alternative was strong on Social Security. It made clear that before we spend one penny of any projected budget surplus, we should save Social Security first. Social Security is a sacred compact with America's seniors. We owe it to every senior citizen to ensure that Social Security is there for them, and that it will be there for today's workers when they retire. Our Democratic alternative was strong on health care. It would have provided for vital new investments in health care research. It would have ensured that the funds generated by a comprehensive tobacco bill-- a priority for the American people--could be used to fight teen smoking, to conduct tobacco-related health research, to provide programs for people who want to quit smoking, and to help tobacco farmers move to new crops. I believe we produced a budget that should have had the support of a bipartisan majority. It was a common sense budget--that kept our commitment to a balanced budget, while providing for the sorts of investments in key priorities that are critical for getting our country ready for the next century. I am deeply disappointed that our alternative was rejected. The Budget Resolution before us now does not meet America's needs. I cannot support it.","word.count":541,"sep11":-3.53370786516854,"years":1998.32584269663,"days":1184,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.155785532253854,"Topic 2":0.15370673657311,"Topic 3":0.088842227316848,"Topic 4":0.00737125706762237,"Topic 5":0.0859996349248345,"Topic 6":0.205895967558163,"Topic 7":0.0268694493110725,"Topic 8":0.256019774269258,"Topic 9":0.0155115054140063,"Topic 10":0.00399791531123106},{"id":"10419950104465","body":"Paul Simon: Mr. President, let me outline what the situation is right now.

The most that is owned by any one entity right now is Infinity. They own 27 stations. CBS owns 26. Under the bill as it is right now, anyone--the Dan Coats Co.--can theoretically own every radio station in the United States. Obviously, I do not think that would happen. But I think diversity in this field is extremely important. My amendment raises that cap of 20 and 20 to 50 and 50 so that there could be 100 stations owned by any one entity. That is a 150-percent increase over where we are right now. I think that is reasonable. I just think it is not in the public interest to have a concentration. Economic concentration generally is not good, but particularly in the media I think there are dangers to the future of our country. Bill Ryan of the Washington Post and Newsweek wrote in Broadcast and Cable of May 27, and said, Let me add that my friends in Infinity and CBS both have no objection to this amendment--the people who own the largest numbers right now.

The Secretary of the Interior determined that the Martin Luther King statue, which is going to be placed in the District of Columbia in memory of Martin Luther King, would be put in the prime area, which is the Mall and the surrounding areas. That determination needed the approval of the Congress. Senator Warner and I joined together in the Senate, along with Congresswoman Morella, who led the effort in the House, in order to bring this about. We will now have a statue in the District in a fairly short time. The money will be raised privately by the Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity. But it will stand as a tribute to what Martin Luther King, Jr. represented, which, in my judgment, was a commitment to achieving change through nonviolence--a very important lesson. Martin Luther King, Jr. clearly worked within the framework of a democratic society. He sought very significant and substantial change. He sought to make the Nation live up to its ideals. But he was committed in doing it in a nonviolent way. I think that is a very important lesson for all Americans. I, like the Senator from Virginia, have personal memories. I was at the Reflecting Pool the day he gave the ``I Have a Dream'' speech, when he stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, and, of course, that speech had a tremendous impact on American society then and continues to have a tremendous impact. So I am very glad that this matter has been moved forward now. All of the legislation that is now necessary is in place, and now we look forward to going ahead and we look forward to, at sometime in the not too distant future, a ground breaking and, sometime thereafter, a dedication.

But there is something that undergirds it entirely, Mr. Speaker, and that is the notion of those who put together this document, the notion of our Founders, which was unique in human history. For in contrast to our English forbearers, or our British cousins, as some of us affectionately refer to our friends across the Atlantic, in this new Nation, in this constitutional republic, we did not choose to recognize one person or one family as sovereign or as sovereigns. Instead, in this Nation we operate from the assumption that, first, power is conferred upon us by a creator, and that in this Nation, the people are sovereign and they in turn confer their power, or political power, if you will, on governmental institutions. Yet, as our friend from Georgia relates the story, what all too often happens is that notion is twisted or turned to where American citizens are suddenly accountable to unelected career Washington bureaucrats, instead, Mr. Speaker, of what was intended, and that is for government to be accountable to the people. So, indeed, this so-called revolution, which, by the way, can only be defined as extreme in terms of the context of making extremely good sense, what is in fact a resolution not born of something radical but something entirely reasonable, simply says that the power, indeed, Mr. Speaker, it is reminiscent of a popular slogan in the 1960's, that power belongs to the people, and that power goes to the people. Let me yield to my friend from Florida.","word.count":296,"sep11":-5.5252808988764,"years":1996.33426966292,"days":475,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.365782073327507,"Topic 2":0.404684379711725,"Topic 3":0.00942557040917023,"Topic 4":0.0346989677754372,"Topic 5":0.0113603441736606,"Topic 6":0.00998421059463682,"Topic 7":0.0125709803766958,"Topic 8":0.011680038150105,"Topic 9":0.132794812421043,"Topic 10":0.00701862306001909},{"id":"10519970008148","body":"Bruce Vento: Pursuant to House Resolution 405, the gentleman from Illinois and a Member opposed each will control 10 minutes.

For example, many of these workers were instrumental in developing our nuclear weapons program. Unfortunately, many workers were not aware of the hazards at their workplace. Remarkably, no preventative equipment like respirators, gloves, or body suits was provided to workers. Currently, over 600 claims for compensation have been filed by Santa Susana Field Lab workers. Ninety percent of those have been denied due to a lack of documentation or their inability to prove that they meet exposure thresholds. Santa Susana Field Lab workers and their families are faced with the burden of having to reconstruct exposure scenarios that existed nearly 40 years ago, in most cases with no records or documentation. My amendment would cut the redtape by amending section 3621 of the Energy Employee Occupational Compensation Program Act of 2000 to treat employees of Santa Susana Field Laboratory as members of the Special Exposure Cohort. Individuals would be eligible for benefits if they worked at Santa Susana Field Lab for a total of 250 days and developed a serious illness that is known to be a result of exposure to radiation or other toxins at the Lab before January 1, 2006. Employees who contracted specified cancers from exposure to radiation would receive at least $150,000, and employees exposed to toxic chemicals would receive $250,000. Additionally, my amendment would allow previously denied Santa Susana Field Lab claimants under the Energy Employee Occupational Compensation Program Act of 2000 the opportunity to reapply for compensation and medical benefits.

The main reason is because politicians who run on promises of tax cuts often end up doing exactly the opposite. They pass tax increases. Just recall for a moment back in 1992 when a certain presidential candidate ran on a middle-class tax cut and, surprise, surprise, what do we get? We got a tax increase, the largest in U.S. history.

He is articulate. He believes strongly in his issues. I would like to, however, try to get us back to the issues as I see them and as I believe they are before us in this body. Few of my colleagues in the Senate support all three of the measures that are before us today. I am one of those. I support repeal of the gas tax because it does not go where it ought to go--into infrastructure repairs which would benefit the users. I support increasing the minimum wage because I believe it is due time that it be increased to reflect the reality of the wages and cost of living in our country. And I am an original cosponsor and a strong supporter of the TEAM Act because I believe we are here talking about not the issues which have been raised by my good friend from Massachusetts but, rather, about improving productivity and working together to straighten out some provisions of the law which have created havoc with respect to businesses working in a friendly relationship with employees in order to improve productivity. That is the issue which we have before us. It is a volatile issue because the unions sense that this will somehow inhibit them from being able to organize and represent workers. However, they are wrong. The bill does not apply if there is a union present. We have also in the act before us, S. 295, specifically stated that it will not interfere with union operations or interfere with the desires of a union. Let me just read those words, and then I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Arizona. What we do is we modify the provision of the law which does define these matters, and we add these words. First of all, we do not change in any way section 8, which defines the employer obligation to bargain collectively with the union that is the certified representative of the employees. We do change section 8 because of the ambiguities inherent in the act. There are some 70 cases now which have tried to define the line as to whether or not discussions by employer-employee work teams or other cooperative groups are infringing upon workers' rights to only be represented by a union. But there is no clarity on this issue. We add these words. They can discuss matters of mutual interest, including issues of quality, productivity and efficiency, and then it adds: That just clarifies it. What you have now is they say, well, why bother, because you have thousands and thousands of these teams out there, but every one of them, if you take a look at those 70 cases which cut one way or another, what you have is 70 areas of confusion, leaving employers in a position to have an action brought before the National Labor Relations Board where they can get a cease-and-desist order and demolish the team, they can be fined. So this is just an attempt to make sure that what ought to be done can be done and there should be no disagreement about it.

The subcommittee began work on this bill in early February when the administration produced its budget. We have had 11 public hearings, beginning on February 16; and the transcripts of these hearings, the administration's official statements, the detailed budget request, and several thousand questions for the record and the statement of Members and the public are all available in seven hearing volumes. The subcommittee and full committee marked up the bill on May 4 and May 10 respectfully. In the allocation process, our discretionary 302 allocation and budget authority will be $14.548 billion and we are exactly at that level. The allocation for outlays will be $15.025 billion, and we are slightly below that level. We have tried very hard to accommodate the requests of Members and to provide increases for critical programs. From all Members of the House, we received about 350 letters with more than 2,900 individual requests for more spending. I am pleased to inform my colleagues that the interest in additional spending in this bill is completely bipartisan. In spite of a very tight budget situation, we have managed to provide increases over fiscal year 2000 to several important programs. Some of those increases include the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, $32 million; the Food Safety and Inspection Service, $24.7 million; the Farm Service Agency, $34 million; the Natural Resources Conservation Service, $8.6 million; the Rural Community Advancement Program, $82 million; WIC, $35 million dollars; and the Food and Drug Administration, a net increase of $57 million. Most accounts have been frozen at the previous year's level, and many of those accounts have been at the same level for several years. Mr. Chairman, we all refer to this bill as an agriculture bill, but it does far more than assisting basic agriculture. It also supports human nutrition; the environment; and food, drug, and medical safety. This is a bill that will deliver benefits to every one of our constituents every day no matter what kind of district they represent. I would say to all Members that they can support this bill and tell all their constituents that they voted to improve their lives while maintaining fiscal responsibility. The bill is a bipartisan product with a lot of hard work and input from both sides of the aisle.

I think it is important to recognize, first, that safe working conditions are primarily the result of efforts by employers and employees working together. Safety consciousness probably is the best key to worker safety. When we add OSHA, and I was one of Michigan's OSHA commissioners for 4\\1/2\\ years, I can guarantee my colleagues that OSHA regulations are some of the most onerous, the most complex legal mandates on business and very difficult to understand. So, in many cases, low wage inspector can go out and, trying to read and enforce the regulation, will cite an employer. If you are a large business, if you are GM or Ford or Chrysler, you have the legal staff to review and understand that kind of allegation and maybe come to terms even before it goes to court. H.R. 2731 levels the playing field for small businesses and encourages OSHA to have greater fairness, and to provide better access to examine the merits of the case. This legislation simply says that OSHA and, therefore, States that adopt OSHA, such as MIOSHA in Michigan, can arbitrally make the determination that if a case was ``substantially justified'' or the ``result of special circumstances'', then you do not have to reimburse that small company for attorneys' fees. The fairness that was tried to be reached in the first place from OSHA was saying if it is a frivolous lawsuit, in effect, then OSHA has a responsibility to reimburse the legal attorneys' fees for that business. This is especially important to small business. I would encourage my colleagues to support 2731. Small business is the key to our economic success in this country, and this simply levels the playing field to make it fair in a challenge by OSHA to that small business and the ability of that small business to react.","word.count":316,"sep11":2.75280898876404,"years":2004.61235955056,"days":3422,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.00926578001802638,"Topic 2":0.309473873384502,"Topic 3":0.00367045545164234,"Topic 4":0.0137771111341106,"Topic 5":0.00417043362826739,"Topic 6":0.0026650737655371,"Topic 7":0.361297690618135,"Topic 8":0.00367658528732191,"Topic 9":0.289434296130632,"Topic 10":0.00256870058182675},{"id":"10419950142914","body":"Ted Stevens: Mr. President, I come to the floor once again to talk about the appearance that I had on ``Nightline'' with the Secretary of the Interior, Mr. Babbitt. In that program, which I call a debate, on ``Nightline,'' the Secretary claimed that the development of the coastal plain of our arctic for its oil potential would mean the end of that wildlife refuge. He referred to the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which is some 19 million acres of our northern part of Alaska. It is above the Arctic Circle, as indicated. As a matter of fact, there are 21.2 million acres of wilderness in this whole area, and that area is larger than Vermont, New Hampshire, Connecticut, and Rhode Island put together. Of this area, in 1980, 1.5 million acres of the arctic plain was set aside for development for oil and gas exploration, subject only to an environmental review to determine whether that type of development would result in irreparable harm to our arctic plain. That is what we call section 1002 of ANILCA, the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. That 1.5 million acres was the only area in the 1980 bill, that dealt with over 100 million acres, that provided for any development in our State. The Secretary says that proceeding as was intended in 1980 would be the end of that wildlife refuge. That is what I am here to talk about today. If we proceed with oil and gas exploration, as is intended by the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, this area will be [[Page S 18012]] leased. There will be bonus bids that will bring in some $2.8 billion, we estimate. It will be at least that because one small area offshore here, the Mukluk, brought in over $1 billion--$1 billion--in a very small area. It was a dry hole. But this leasing will take place. As the exploration takes place, the total area that will be used out of that 1.5 million acres is about 12,000 acres. That is about the size of Dulles Airport. And, after that exploration takes place, the actual area of development, for the roads, the buildings, the rigs that will be in place for the period of development, will be about 2,000 acres; 2,000 acres of the 1.5 million which is part of 19 million acres total in that refuge. I come to speak about this rhetoric because the administration is trying to leave the impression with the American public that, if this leasing takes place, it is the end of this whole refuge. As a matter of fact, Mr. President, the wilderness area selected by the Interior Department is in the area south of the arctic coastal plain and just at the slope of the Brooks Range. We call it the North Slope of the Brooks Range. It is not in the arctic plain. You know, Mr. President, it is a very difficult thing for people to understand that this is an arctic desert. The oil exploration will take place in an area which is an arctic desert. The problem comes that the porcupine caribou herd, which lives approximately 9 months of the year in Canada on the Porcupine River area, migrates into Alaska and goes 150 miles up onto the North Slope. It is present on the plain maybe 6 to 8 weeks when it decides to go up there. Some years it does not go at all, as I will mention. But when we were debating the oil pipeline-- this is the area of the oil pipeline up to the Prudhoe Bay. This is the Prudhoe Bay development right there. It is on State land. The land belongs to the State of Alaska. The claim was made 20 years ago that approval of that pipeline would lead to the destruction of the caribou herd. We call it the central arctic caribou herd. One person actually stood on the floor here and said that, if we got the approval to build the Alaska oil pipeline, all of the caribou would die, that it would be the end of the central arctic herd that lives near Prudhoe Bay. Did the caribou disappear? Did the pipeline, this tremendous pipeline that has brought us 11 billion barrels of oil so far--cause the caribou to disappear? Have they been injured? As a matter of fact, at the time we debated that pipeline, the caribou herd was about 6,000 animals. It went up to 23,400 animals by 1992. As we came to 1992, the development was over, and really man's presence started to be reduced in this area. The caribou have actually reduced in number as the number of people involved in the Prudhoe Bay area has been reduced. They are down to about 18,100 this year. But that is still more than three times the size of the caribou herd at the time the prediction was made that they would all die if the oil pipeline was put in place. The health of the caribou has very little to do with man's presence. As a matter of fact, that caribou herd is a very healthy herd. I have been up there. I would be glad to one of these days bring some photographs showing the caribou standing next to oil rigs, caribou rubbing up against the pipeline to scratch their backs, caribou coming up on top of the crosswalks to go over the pipeline because they are trying to get away from the mosquitoes. They are trying to get in a breeze, get high enough to get rid of the mosquitoes. That is a very flat area--the arctic plain. It is an area that has so many mosquitoes that very few animals or people spend much time there. If they do, they are very heavily loaded down with mosquito dope. I mean real, real mosquito dope. But technology is different now than 20 years ago when that pipeline was developed. There is no question, as I said, that the size of the actual development in the arctic plain will be quite small. We are looking now at the problem of what will human activity in this area do that might affect the caribou that might be different from this area around Prudhoe Bay. The answer is nothing. This will not be the end of the wildlife refuge. That assertion cannot be supported by any facts. It really is not only misleading; it is wrong. It is not truthful. This herd, as I said, does not stay there permanently. The central arctic herd stays there--in Prudhoe Bay--permanently. The central arctic herd is a very migrating herd. Sometimes it does not go up there. Our records show that in 1973, 1974, 1982, and 1988 the caribou did not come into this area at all. The caribou wander around in terms of this whole area. It is the fact that the caribou sometimes actually come over and go back into Canada into the area where there is substantial presence of the oil and gas industry over by the Beaufort Sea. Our arctic plain is, as I said, a desert. It is almost perfectly flat. It is treeless. That might surprise people because they see the photographs that are in the brochures of all of these extreme environmental organizations saying ``save this place from development.'' They show you beautiful lakes and hills, trees, bear, and caribou, and even, one time, an elk. There has never been any elk up there. It is a frozen desert. It has about 5 to 7 inches total of precipitation, snow and rain, in a 12-month period. Think of that--5 to 7 inches. This ground is permanently frozen. Water will not even penetrate it. Whatever melts from the snow gathers in small pools. They become shallow and stagnant. That is where we get the mosquitoes. It is probably the best breeding ground for mosquitoes in the whole United States. There is no question that the animals that are there, particularly the caribou, are driven nuts by the mosquitoes. They are very vicious. As I said, the mosquitoes drive these caribou so that they go under and on top of the pipeline. They try to get away from them by getting into the breeze that may be caused by wind blowing under the pipeline or over the pipeline. The wilderness area that we have is here. It is south of the 1002 area. When you listen to the Secretary of the Interior, it sounds like we are trying to lease a wilderness area. That again is not true. It has never been true. This area once was the Arctic Wildlife Range. It was created by a secretarial order, and that order specifically stated that oil and gas leasing could take place on the range subject to stipulations to protect the fish and wildlife. At the time we considered this enormous act that withdrew all of these areas that are outlined in either blue or green or red, the Congress looked at all of them. And this is the only area, as I said, where the natural resources were so significant that the area was set aside, specifically stating that it would be subject to oil and gas leasing. The only thing that had to happen was that there had to be an environmental study made. It came to Congress not for the purpose of trying to open it. It has always been open. The question is, Should Congress approve the finding of the Secretary of the Interior that there would not be irreparable harm to this area if oil and gas development took place? It is 1\\1/2\\ million acres. Out of all of this area, as I said, of the whole area that belongs to the Federal Government up here, some 21.2 million acres of the arctic is set aside as wilderness. As a matter of fact, Mr. President, 65 percent of all wilderness in the United States is in our State. Sixty-five percent of all the wilderness in the United States is in our State. Fifty-six million acres total have already been set aside as wilderness. In addition to that, we have 70 percent of the national parklands. We have 85 percent of all the national wildlife refuges in Alaska. That is the only area that Congress has ever designated as being set aside for oil and gas development. The Secretary tries to let the American public believe that this Senator is trying to authorize drilling in a wilderness area. It is not a wilderness area. It never was a wilderness area.

We passed a bill in 1997 that was aimed at trying to balance the budget and trying to save Medicare. We succeeded in balancing the budget. We have been in the process since that day of trying to undo everything we did. We have put together a package that costs over $27 billion in Medicare give-backs. About half the package is totally deserved and desperately needed. About half the package in my opinion-- I am speaking just for myself--represents things that are bad public policy, and it is being done for one simple reason: We have the money. Why not spend it? I am not going to go down a long list. But let me give you one example--bad debt forgiveness. Believe it or not, this bill has a provision that says to hospitals, if you don't collect your bad debt--remember, Medicaid pays for health care for poor people. We have two provisions of Medicare that provide taxpayer assistance above Medicaid for very marginal income people who are not poor but they have difficulty paying their bills. When we are talking about bad debt, we are talking about bad-debt incurred by people who didn't qualify for Medicaid. We have a provision in this bill where the taxpayer will simply come in and pick up 70 percent-plus of bad debt costs for hospitals. Collecting debt is difficult. Ask any retail merchant, or ask anybody who is in business in America. They will tell you it is hard to collect debt. What do you think is going to happen when the taxpayer pays 70 percent of the debt that hospitals don't want to collect and that people do not want to pay? They are going to stop collecting. People are going to stop paying, and the taxpayer is going to pay. To get to the bottom line on this issue, the President says: Look, you didn't spend enough money on the things I wanted it spent on, and I am going to veto this $27 billion give-back. I hope the President does veto it. I think about half of it is justified. I think we could have done it for $15 billion, and could have done a reasonably good job. But my own view is that if the President vetoes it--we are just moments now from an election. We are going to have a new President. My suggestion is, if the President vetoes this bill, that we simply wait until January for a new President--hopefully, someone who will be more responsible than this President--and we will take a very serious look at Medicare. In this bill, with spending of $27 billion, we could not find one penny of savings to put in the bill. There is not one thing currently being done in America in health care, including a new scam by States where they simply overcharge the Federal Government and pocket part of the difference--we could not find one thing on which we could save money. I find that difficult to sell. Finally, there was an article in today's Washington Post by David Broder. I don't always agree with David Broder, but I always think about what he has to say. I guess if you want to define a serious commentator and set it out in a column, you would have to put David Broder's name at the top of that list. You may not like what he says about you. You may not like what he says about your view. But he doesn't say anything that he doesn't think about. I admire that. He points out today in an article that says ``So Long, Surplus'' that we are currently--this year--on the verge of spending $100 billion more than we said we would spend this year when we adopted the much touted Balanced Budget Act in 1997, which Bill Clinton signed. This wasn't just Congress, this was Congress and the President. We are on the verge of spending $100 billion this year more than we said we were going to spend. I just want to say that someday people are going to ask: What happened to this surplus? They are going to ask: Why didn't we rebuild Medicare? Why didn't we rebuild Social Security by putting real assets into Social Security--not taking anything out of Social Security but putting real assets into Social Security--by taking this money and investing it in stocks, bonds, and real assets so we have something to pay benefits with in the future? Someday someone is going to ask: What happened to that surplus? Why couldn't we, when tax rates were at the highest level in American history, have some tax relief for working families? Why did we have to keep forcing people to sell the farm or business in order to pay the Government a death tax? Why did we have to tax marriage and love in the marriage tax penalty? Someday somebody is going to ask those questions. I just want to be on record saying I think it is outrageous that we are doing this. I think we need to stop doing this. I read in the paper where the President said he is like the Buddha. He is like Buddha. He just sits and waits and waits, and Congress wants to go home, and the only way they are going to go home is to spend all of this money. I repeat that I am not going anywhere. President Clinton's number of days as President is now short. My point is that we have a right to say no. We have a right to say in education when we have spent every penny the President said he wanted but we want to let States decide how to spend the money--we want to give them the same money, but we want them to decide how to spend it, and President Clinton says: No. I am going to veto your bill because I want to tell States how to spend it. I think we have an obligation to say no. If people need schools, they can take the money and build schools. If they need more teachers, they can take the money and hire more teachers. But if they need other things, they can take the money and do that, because they know their needs better than Bill Clinton. But that is not what the President wants. We spent every penny he asked for--too much money, in my opinion. But he said he is going to veto that bill because we give the States the ability to decide what they need to spend the money on. My answer to that is, let him veto it, and then we can pass a continuing resolution. Let's have an election. If people want to spend this surplus, if they want to spend it on program after program after program, if they want more government and less freedom, they know how to vote in this election. If you want the Government to spend more, and if you want this surplus to be spent on government programs, you know how to vote. But we ought not to let Bill Clinton spend the money before the American people vote for more spending. First, I don't think they are going to do it; but, second, that is what elections are about. I think we have to quit kowtowing to the President. If he wants to force us to stay here and pass these bills day after day after day, if I were running for reelection and were in a close race, I would go home and campaign. But for the 60-some-plus of us who are not up for reelection, let's just stay here in town. And if the President suddenly becomes reasonable, we will reach an agreement. But if he is going to play Budhha, to quote him, and sit there and see if it will work one more time--that is, if by threatening to hold us in session he can get us to spend more money than our budget and more money than his budget-- he wants to see if it will work one more time, I want to say no. I think the American people would rejoice in it. I am hopeful my fellow colleagues will come to the conclusion that the President is asking too high a price to see this session of Congress end. Too much money. Too much change in permanent law that does not represent the will of the American people. I think we need to say no. The sooner we say no, the sooner the President will come to his senses. And he will for a simple reason: He is not holding a strong hand here. He is the one moving off. We are not moving anywhere. I think we can come to a compromise with the President, but I think we ought to be tired of being run over. I say we should not spend more money simply to get out of town. To do that would basically betray everything we claim to believe in and betrays the people who are going to pay our salary, whether we are in town or not. I thank my colleagues for their indulgence, and I yield the floor.","word.count":1571,"sep11":-0.921348314606742,"years":2000.93820224719,"days":2114,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.144880049129567,"Topic 2":0.386700923421244,"Topic 3":0.280630315947085,"Topic 4":0.0078218413821295,"Topic 5":0.131731068674956,"Topic 6":0.0219556708410028,"Topic 7":0.00415514958888125,"Topic 8":0.0114203394860215,"Topic 9":0.00545563259528835,"Topic 10":0.00524900893382437},{"id":"10619990030287","body":"Sue Kelly: Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this Democratic bill, which defies everything that is American.

This legislation is necessitated by the expiration at the end of this fiscal year of the existing authorization for the former U.S. Customs Service. It is also a part of our ongoing process of exercising oversight and focusing on the critical importance of the efficient flow of trade across our borders. The Customs Service has a long and distinguished history. It was the first agency of the Federal Government to be created over 220 years ago to collect revenue and to ensure that imports flow smoothly across the border. Today, Customs collects more than $20 billion in revenue each year. With international trade comprising nearly 25 percent of our gross domestic product, CBP's mission to move goods across the border in a smooth, efficient, and predictable manner is a vital part of our economic strength and viability. In addition to this, over the years, Customs has taken on many other functions because of its unique border presence. Fighting against illegal drugs, transshiped t-shirts, and Rolex knock-offs are just a few of these other functions. In the wake of the terrorist attacks on the United States, the role of Customs in guarding our borders against chemical, biological, and conventional weapons has become more prominent. This legislation authorizes sufficient funding for CBP and ICE to satisfy all of their various responsibilities. This legislation also authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 for the Office of the United States Trade Representative of $39.6 million per year. In order to ensure that we benefit from free and fair trade, it authorizes an additional $2 million per year for the appointment of additional staff in the Office of the General Counsel and the Office of Monitoring and Enforcement. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that this legislation passed the Committee on Ways and Means by a bipartisan 33 to nothing vote, and I look forward to its passage by the House today.","word.count":308,"sep11":1.8876404494382,"years":2003.74719101124,"days":3114,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.267909683937324,"Topic 2":0.0238467530966247,"Topic 3":0.332394189819142,"Topic 4":0.0904248280329584,"Topic 5":0.188518283764256,"Topic 6":0.0529301180118386,"Topic 7":0.00365998133271017,"Topic 8":0.0327391151577029,"Topic 9":0.0030715004606509,"Topic 10":0.00450554638679155},{"id":"11020070077612","body":"Robert Menendez: Madam President, I appreciate the offer from the distinguished Senator from Texas, and I certainly hope we will take his offer because I would have to object if we were to try to proceed tonight to a vote on his amendment.

As was pointed out earlier, there is an estimated 800,000 needlesticks per year across this country. The potential for needlesticks put health care workers and patients at risk of contracting diseases, like Hepatitis C and B and HIV. In California, the results of legislation that I authored when in the State Senate found that most needlesticks could be prevented by using better designed safer needles and following stricter disposal protocols. This bill and these findings helped to lead to a 1998 mandate for safer needles in California. In addition to saving lives, it is estimated that in California, we will save over $100 million per year as a result of these safer needles. The savings are calculated by using the costs of disability payments, testing and treatment, lost wages, and liability costs. H.R. 5178 will require the use of safer needles, require more consistent documentation of needlestick injuries, and it establishes the stronger Federal uniform standard for the disposal and the usage of needles. It will save lives.

Actually, it should not have taken the moms whose children died at the Columbine High School youth massacre. It should not take the moms who are still feeling the reverberations of the Jonesboro, Arkansas, shooting. And it should not have taken what the moms at the Granada Hills Jewish Community Center in Los Angeles went through just last August. But what has happened with the killing of youth over the past year, and it has been more than a year since Columbine, has caused the mothers of America to take the matter into their own hands, and well they might because this Congress has not taken it into its hands, to do something about it. These mothers are coming. I do not know if there will be a million, but I know there will be a lot. And this is what they say to us, ``We are putting our elected officials on notice that we, the mothers, will not tolerate them putting the gun lobby before the safety of our children any longer. We expect results, and we will hold our elected officials accountable if they do not deliver.'' Mr. Speaker, these are some serious women and their families. These are some moms who wanted to test us to see whether if they come they can get the attention that the killings of children throughout the United States have failed to attract. The moms do not doubt that every Member of this body and of the other body are seriously concerned about the deaths of these and the 80,000 children who have died from gunfire, accidental, suicidal, and homicidal since 1979. They know we care. They do not know that we have the political will to do what is necessary to stop these killings. I am grateful that two Members of this body, the gentlewoman from Maryland and the gentlewoman from New York , have introduced a Congressional resolution praising the Million Mom March. They know that this body is full of Members who support gun safety legislation and certainly the gun legislation that is pending before the House at the moment in conference committee. Because that is, by any standards, very modest legislation. The million moms, of course, are way out in front of us on legislation. Their crusade, and it has taken on the appearance of a mother's crusade, began with a single mother, not with any special interest organization, not with any group of lobbyists sitting around trying to get our attention, but with a single mother who, following the North Valley Jewish Community Center shooting last August, simply could not take it anymore. One mom started. And if ever there is a meaning to grassroots movement, that is what has happened ever since. It has been 9 months. There must be some symbolic importance of that time since she started this crusade. And it has grown like wildfire in every State of the Union. It started with suburban, middle class moms. And that is very interesting as far as this Member, who represents a large city, is concerned. Because until the Columbine youth massacre, the real focus had been on the one-on-one shootings, and that is what they mostly were and mostly are, that occur in large cities because kids so easily get ahold of guns. What has made this a national priority is that mothers and families now see that these guns know no borders and that suburban children are at least as fascinated with guns as anywhere. So we are going to see hundreds of buses come into this town from Texas and California, to Maine and Michigan. In April they said Pennsylvania was leading in buses. By now I do not know if some other State has overtaken Maine. Rosie O'Donnell, the television celebrity, who everybody knows is a big opponent of the proliferation of guns, is going to be the MC. But the fact is, Mr. Speaker, that we will not find many Members of this body speaking because the moms want to speak for themselves. There will be an occasional public official speaking. But, apparently, to qualify to speak, if they happen to be a public official, they have to have been a public official who has suffered gun violence in her own family. I love it that the march will be open not, as is the usual case, by our mayor, after all, he is not a mom, but by the woman we call Nana Williams, the mother of the mayor. And then the moms will step forward to tell their stories and to let us know what they want. Look, everybody else has tried. We begin in quite civil debates on the subject. The media delight in airing the subject. None of that talk has gotten us anywhere on the most modest legislation, the bill pending before us, where we literally are almost at the point of absolute agreement literally with about an inch to go and cannot get that inch accomplished. That inch, of course, has largely to do with closing the gun show loophole, with most of us agreeing that instant checks would do it but not wanting to let the most dangerous potential owners get through because they will require at least 24 hours. We hear about the dozen children every day who die from gunshot wounds. These do not always occur in the way, of course, that the terrible tragedy occurred at Columbine. These happen with accidents. They happen with kids playing with guns. These happen with suicides. What they all have in common is the easy availability of guns to kid. Well, the moms, in all of their literature, insist upon speaking for themselves. Here again is what they say. ``Now we moms are mad, and we mean business. We want Congress to create a meaningful gun policy in this country that treats guns like cars.'' I have to tell my colleagues that I would save some time if I did not have to get my car checked or the registration renewed. But most of us understand that a car is seen as a dangerous weapon. If that is true about a car that is used normally in a quite benign fashion, I guess the moms have a point when they say they do not understand why guns cannot be treated like cars. As I contemplated Columbine, which has weighed on my mind for the full year since it took place, I was jolted when a big-city version of the suburban tragedy in Colorado came right here to the Nation's capital at the National Zoo that the House and the Senate established long ago essentially for children. Seven children were wounded when gunfire broke out on Easter Monday. Thank God none of them were killed. But, Mr. Speaker, one of them lies still gravely wounded in Children's Hospital here. I, of course, have visited that family. It is a very brave family. They have stayed away from the press. They are very dignified. The family has devoted its energy to prayer and to this 11-year-old child who is fighting for his life. They call him Pappy because when he was born he looked like a papoose. They delight in talking about him. Because this 11-year-old is no man-child. He is still a child and is still acting like a child, jumping up in his mama's bed, playing with his video games, loving his mom and his dad, and is part of a big, extended family. So they feel a real hole in their hearts with this youngster lying in the bed. It is interesting. His mother, in talking to me, brought up the Million Mom March. She said, you know Congresswoman, I go to all these marches. So I intended to go to the Million Mom March, but I am certainly going to go this time. And so, she will be with me. Mrs. Bates, the mother of Harris Pappy Bates, will be marching with me and with mothers from Maryland, Virginia, and the District on Sunday. On Sunday, we are going to start out from Freedom Plaza at 11 o'clock and we are going to march together as a region to drive home the point that we know that these borders are porous. The moms in Virginia and Maryland say they know that the guns come from their States and from other States. We in the District have done our job in banning guns altogether. We are not asking for other jurisdictions to do exactly as we are doing, but we do think that our Government has an obligation to protect us all in the national union of which we are a part by enacting legislation to protect our kids. So there is going to be a Metro Moms March from Freedom Plaza to the march simply to show solidarity in the region for our kids, to put aside all the rhetoric, to put aside all of the jingoism about where we are from and to stand together with our kids on Sunday and to make our own regional statement. And just as we will be making our own regional statement, we know that mothers from every State in the Union will be carrying the flag of their State to talk about their experience and to speak directly to us, mom to Congress, about our job, our part of the job in eliminating these guns. I see, Mr. Speaker, that one of our distinguished Members, the gentlewoman from California , has come to the floor. I yield to the gentlewoman. Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia for her leadership and her passion on this issue. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support today's special order and to thank again the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia for bringing attention to this serious problem in our Nation. It is a serious issue that is really plaguing the families and the children of our mothers. As a mother and a grandmother, I am moved by the efforts and commitment of mothers across this Nation to draw attention to the thousands of children who have been killed by gunfire. As a legislator, however, I am disturbed that we here in Congress have not heard the pleas for common sense gun legislation. Throughout this session, we have struggled to keep the focus of Congress on gun safety, one of the most vital issues facing our country today. This Congress has sat idle for some 9 months, refusing to pass common sense legislation or to hold a simple meeting while an alarming number of America's children are gunned down every day.

Madam Speaker, H.R. 3712 as amended is a bill to designate the Federal building located at 1716 Spielbusch Avenue in Toledo, Ohio, as the ``James M. Ashley and Thomas W.L. Ashley United States Courthouse''. The late Congressman and Governor James M. Ashley and former Congressman Thomas W.L. Ashley served their Ohio constituents for over 30 years as Members of Congress and Governor. The Ashley family has served with distinction in public service for a span of almost 100 years in the state of Ohio. James Monroe Ashley served five terms as a Republican Congressman from Ohio. Governor Ashley's best known Congressional achievement was as the primary sponsor of the resolution which is recognized as the antecedent of the thirteenth amendment which abolished slavery within the United States and its territories. While in Congress, James Ashley also became the chair of the House Committee on Territories, leading the congressional effort to organize Nevada, Idaho, Arizona, Wyoming, and Montana. As chair of the House Committee on Territories, he wrote the enabling act for Nebraska, Colorado, and Nevada on which he conditioned that a separate vote be held by these potential member States that would prevent them from establishing slavery without the consent and approval of Congress. With this measure, Ashley, an avowed abolitionist, signaled that no new slave States would be admitted to the Union. After serving in Congress, James M. Ashley was appointed Governor of Montana in 1869 by President Ulysses S. Grant. Thomas William Ludlow Ashley was the great-grandson of former Governor and Congressman James M. Ashley. Congressman Thomas Ashley served in the United States Army during the Second World War. He went on to graduate first from Yale University in 1948 and from the Ohio State University Law School in 1951. Congressman Ashley later held several positions as a private lawyer and a member of the media. In 1954 Congressman Ashley was elected as a Democrat to Congress and went on to serve a total of 13 terms in Congress. While in Congress, Congressman Ashley served as chairman of the Select Committee on Energy and the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries. Congressman Ashley also served as the assistant majority whip for the Democratic Party. Congressman Ashley's most prominent legislative success was PL 89-117 which directed the Federal Government to assist in the provision of housing for low and moderate income families. This law was the precursor to the creation of the Department of Housing and Urban Development which was created later in that same Congress. After leaving Congress in 1981, Ashley went on to found a legal and consulting firm in Washington, DC. Congressman Thomas W.L. Ashley currently resides in the Washington, DC area. James Monroe Ashley and Thomas William Ludlow Ashley will be remembered as distinguished public servants to the great State of Ohio. The Ashley family served as leaders in both the Democratic and Republican Party in Ohio and each served their party well. They will be respected as great Americans whose dedication to public service was passed down through the generations. As such, it is very appropriate that the United States Courthouse in Toledo, Ohio, be designated as the ``James M. Ashley and Thomas W.L. Ashley United States Courthouse''. I recognize the gentlelady from Ohio for as much time as she may consume.","word.count":559,"sep11":6.90449438202247,"years":2008.76404494382,"days":4900,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.93618276153792,"Topic 2":0.0207068231094849,"Topic 3":0.00446522144753129,"Topic 4":0.0114967281028819,"Topic 5":0.0044351608774032,"Topic 6":0.00516666467096035,"Topic 7":0.00340538796989597,"Topic 8":0.00809141341265886,"Topic 9":0.00420451360147802,"Topic 10":0.00184532526978553},{"id":"10419960065991","body":"Jon Kyl: Mr. President, I am delighted to take some time. As I informed the Senator from Nebraska earlier, we had only two speakers remaining on our side. I knew the Senator from Nebraska had several speakers. I, therefore, wanted to give those speakers an opportunity to present the arguments against our amendment, which I had already explained in great detail when we first laid it down a week ago. I have been on the floor twice explaining it. I will do it again. I am happy to do it, because we are asking for something that is very modest, yet very important. I hope all the Senators who are watching will appreciate the fact it is important to defeat the motion to table that will be laid down. I think the easiest way to describe what this amendment does is to use this chart. If you go to the line above Kyl-Reid amendment, you see where we are today: the status quo, what the law provides with respect to nuclear testing. And that is what we are talking about today: the President's authority to conduct an underground nuclear test in the event that he should deem it necessary to do so. That authority expires, Mr. President, on September 30 of this year. When some say, ``Well, we may not have that big of a problem with the amendment, but we're concerned about the timing because we're engaged in these delicate negotiations''--I will come back to that in a minute--but the reason we raised the amendment now is because the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee said if you have amendments to the bill, lay them down now. Mine was the second amendment laid down, just following the instructions of the chairman. Secondly, we have to do this before September 30. As you know, we are not going to have that much in the way of legislative time. But third, I have already offered to the Senator from Nebraska, who I see now leaves the Chamber, but I made this offer before and I make it again. I am delighted to delay this vote until the evening of the 28th--long after the day in Geneva has expired--because I have no intention of having this amendment have any effect whatsoever on the negotiations. It does not, it cannot, there is no relationship whatsoever, but for those who thought it might, I was perfectly willing to delay the vote, and I am still willing to do that. I will make that offer here again right now. Assuming we defeat the motion to table, I will be happy to have this amendment be the very last one considered before final action on the defense authorization bill, which I assume will be on Friday. Now let us go back to the explanation of the law. On September 30, there is only one basis for the President to conduct a nuclear test, and that is if another nation tests. Over the last 12 months or so, we have seen France test, Russia may have tested--the intelligence is not clear on that--and China has conducted a test, and China has said it is going to conduct at least one more test. So those tests would give the President of the United States the authority to conduct nuclear tests until such time as the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty [CTBT] goes into force. That is what we have showing here. We do not know when that will be, if ever, but we presume it will occur, and so we just entered it on this line here. At that point, as the Senator from Nebraska said, there will not be any nuclear test, except in the extraordinary event of what is called the supreme national interest, which is an event very unlikely, if at all likely, to occur. So, in effect, the only thing that can cause the President to test after September 30 is if another nation tests. Now, is that a logical basis upon which the United States would conduct nuclear testing? The answer, of course, is no. Because France tested, does that therefore provide a reason for the United States to test? No. Even China's tests do not provide a reason for the United States to test. We have developed our nuclear arsenal. We have really only three reasons to test, Mr. President. The first is for the safety of our stockpile, to ensure that as weapons become 20 or 30 years old and begin to deteriorate--and they do deteriorate--that the safety of the weapons is not compromised, that the safety requirements of the people who handle the weapons is not compromised. I will return to that issue of safety in a moment. The second reason is reliability. Will they still work, or, as a result of this deterioration, does there come a point in time when we cannot assure the reliability of the stockpile? At that point, we do not have an adequate return, obviously. The third reason to test is to deal with a recent phenomenon: the problem of terrorism. We have just seen a terrible event occur in Saudi Arabia involving a bomb, and many people have suggested that perhaps the terrorist state's worst weapon is a nuclear bomb delivered by a truck. Today, we do not have a good way of dismantling that bomb, and the experts at our national laboratories believe that there may come a point in time when we have to understand how to dismantle such a weapon. We have to know how to do it, obviously, in advance, because we may have very little warning when the time comes. Do you shoot a laser at it? Do you overpower it with electrical voltage? What can you do to disarm that bomb? We may have to conduct some kind of low-level test to find that out. None of this, Mr. President, advances nuclear weapons in the world. As a matter of fact, it is all designed to reduce their use: the dismantling or disarming of a terrorist device, providing for total safety so no device would ever go off. These are defensive measures, if you will. We are not developing new nuclear weapons, and nobody is proposing to do that. But, effectively, after September 30, our ability to test, unless another country tests, will have been eliminated, terminated by the law, and that is what we are trying to prevent. What we are saying in our amendment is really very simple, and if you go below the line that says ``Kyl-Reid amendment,'' you will see what our amendment will do. We simply extend this September 30 deadline until such time as a CTBT goes into effect. At that point, you have an entirely different set of rules, but until that time, we continue to have the option of testing for stockpile safety and reliability purposes. We would not have to wait for another nation to test to have the ability to test. But importantly, we also added some other safeguards in our amendment. We provide in our amendment that the President will continue to report to the Congress on the stockpile and will provide a report on the necessity for any testing. Now, those reports are not required after September 30. And we provide that the President's authority to test after September 30 is subject to a veto by the Congress. If a majority of the Congress says ``no'' to a testing message by the President, then the President would not be allowed to test. So we tighten up the law after September 30, and I think that is a good thing for us to have done.","word.count":1277,"sep11":-5.34550561797753,"years":1996.51404494382,"days":539,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.945100943861552,"Topic 2":0.0176409618316191,"Topic 3":0.00382439947747059,"Topic 4":0.0102078590460119,"Topic 5":0.00377931838680544,"Topic 6":0.00434869001762835,"Topic 7":0.00295337935691239,"Topic 8":0.00695636871936354,"Topic 9":0.00362110756264904,"Topic 10":0.00156697173998782},{"id":"10419960053621","body":"Jon Kyl: Madam President, I rise in support of Senate Joint Resolution 21, a resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution to limit congressional terms to two in the Senate and six in the House--12 years in each body. Madam President, I want to begin my remarks by thanking the majority leader, Senator Dole, for making good on his promise to schedule Senate action on the term limit amendment this month. Without his support and his commitment to term limits, this initiative probably would never have seen the light of day. It would have been easy to dodge a vote--as many opponents, no doubt, would like to have been able to do--since the House already voted down a term limit amendment last year. But Senator Dole followed through on his commitment to ensure that there would be a full and fair debate and that we would have an opportunity to vote on the issue. The American people deserve to know where their Senators stand. Madam President, term limits are no panacea. They will not guarantee the election of sensible and honest individuals to Congress. They will not put an end to the influence that special interests can sometimes wield on Capitol Hill. However, term limits will help. They will help by ensuring regular turnover in Congress--guaranteeing that the people who make our laws have to live under the laws they have passed. It is too easy for legislators, who have been on Capitol Hill too long, to forget what it is like to struggle in the marketplace to survive--what it means to try to meet a payroll when the Federal Government is constantly imposing new mandates on a small business. New taxes, new regulations, more redtape. They forget what it is like for a family to try to make ends meet, when more and more is taken from their paychecks in taxes every week--higher gasoline and FICA taxes, for example. Members of Congress have learned a lot in just the short time that the Congressional Accountability Act has been in place. The myriad of workplace laws and regulations had little meaning before last year because they never applied to Congress. When we finally had to live under the same laws and regulations as the rest of the country, the people's frustrations took on a whole new meaning. It is that kind of connection with what people have to endure from their government on a daily basis that term limits will foster. Congressional service should not be a life-long career. Term limits would also help to disperse some of the power that has become concentrated in the hands of a few very senior Members of both bodies. It would also help to ensure that all of us make decisions that are in accord with the views of the electorate. Take the Federal budget, for example. The American people have been demanding less spending, lower taxes, and a balanced budget in more forceful terms every year. Newer Members of Congress tend to vote for less Federal spending than those who have served for a long time. In fact, a recent National Taxpayers Union [NTU] survey found a correlation between tenure in Congress and increased spending. NTU found that the 88 freshmen members of the House who were elected in 1994 voted for an average of $26 billion less in spending than non- freshmen did. The 11 new Senators elected in 1994 supported an average of $26.2 billion more in spending reduction than their senior colleagues. That is not to say that all of the more senior Members voted for more Government spending. But as a group, newer Members more closely reflected the desires of their constituents for less spending and leaner Government. It is a trend that term limits would help to promote. Madam President, 23 States, including my home State of Arizona, have attempted to impose term limits on their congressional delegations. But a year ago, the U.S. Supreme Court held that all State term-limit laws that apply to U.S. Senators and Congressmen are unconstitutional. The majority held that the Constitution fixes the qualifications for congressional service, and that neither Congress nor the States may supplement them. That is why we have a constitutional amendment before us today--because all other legislative avenues have been foreclosed. More than 200 years ago, Thomas Jefferson wrote a friend suggesting ways that the newly drafted Constitution could be improved. Jefferson said three things were missing: a Bill of Rights, limits on the tenure of the Chief Executive, and term limits for Congress. Since then, we have seen Jefferson's first two ideas implemented; the resolution before us today embraces the last. Madam President, I urge support for the term limits amendment.","word.count":783,"sep11":-5.5252808988764,"years":1996.33426966292,"days":475,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0403789781930294,"Topic 2":0.386614508473108,"Topic 3":0.00633530503436558,"Topic 4":0.247624312549659,"Topic 5":0.0180567325056928,"Topic 6":0.00718321330270484,"Topic 7":0.117181531519648,"Topic 8":0.0257746989489209,"Topic 9":0.133791974833297,"Topic 10":0.0170587446395744},{"id":"10820040012857","body":"Duncan Hunter: Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes Let me just say in response to my colleague who has just spoken that we did something that was unprecedented in this bill, which was look into the future, into the last several months of this year, and decide that, even though we all agreed and the budget chairman announced on the floor and to the world that we were going to need supplementals of $50 billion this next year, we decided that we did not want to have any strain on the troops in the closing months of this year before Congress, after the election, could put together another supplemental. So we provided this bridge, which even the gentleman will admit carries us well into the next year, into the next calendar year; and we did fully provide for the additional forces that we have in the field, the 1st Armored Division, which is going to be an additional $750,000. For all of the armor upgrades, we have got roughly $1 billion for armor upgrades in Humvees and trucks, for all of the modernization that the chief of staff of the Army needs for modularity, that is, building this new brigade centric force for the U.S. Army. The reason we do not go off into the new year and say, okay, should it be $50 billion, should it be $75 billion is very simple. We cannot see the future. We do not know how much weight this new Iraqi military is going to be able to take on their shoulders, how fast we are going to be able to make this handoff; and all of those things drive the costs of operation.

In this regard, there will be some good news today. I anticipate that this fine man will have a vote on the floor of the Senate, that the cloture motion will pass, and we will allow an up-or-down vote and he will get confirmed. To my two colleagues from Mississippi: Well done. You have sent to the Senate an unusually well-qualified candidate by any standard you would like to apply to a person in terms of his humanity, his intellect, and his judicial demeanor. It is one of the best selections I have had the privilege of reviewing since I have been in the Senate. The unfortunate news is that we are having to go through this particular exercise to get 60 votes. Quite frankly, I think the accusations being made against Judge Southwick are unfounded and just political garbage, to be honest with you. He has received the highest qualified rating from the American Bar Association. Everyone who has ever served with Judge Southwick, in any capacity, whether it be as a judge, a lawyer, or private citizen, has nothing but glowing things to say about the man. And really, we are trying to use two legal events to cast doubt over the man. Six hundred cases he has sat in judgment upon, and the American Bar Association has reviewed all these cases, I would assume, and come to the conclusion that he is at their highest level in terms of judicial qualification. Judge Southwick has done things as a person that have really been beneficial to Mississippi. He has tried to bring out the best in Mississippi. These are the types of people you would hope to represent the State of Mississippi--or any other State, for that matter--in terms of their demeanor, their tolerance, their willingness to work together with all groups to move their State forward. Now, the two cases in question are just complete garbage--the idea that the term ``homosexual lifestyle'' was used in an opinion that he concurred in involving a custody case. That term, if you research it in the law, has been used in hundreds of different cases--over 100 cases. President Clinton mentioned it in 1993 when he was talking about his policy regarding the military. It is a term that was used in the Mississippi court cases that were the precedent for the case involved. And to say that he concurred in an opinion where the authoring judge used that term has somehow tainted him means you better go through the records and throw a bunch of judges off, Democrats and Republicans. That is ridiculous, completely ridiculous, and if applied in any fair way would just be--it would be chaos. You would have politicians, you would have judges, you would have people from all over the country who somehow, because of that term having been used in a judicial opinion, couldn't sit in judgment of others. That is ridiculous. Just go search the record of how this term has been used. To suggest that it means something in Judge Southwick's case but no one else's has a lot to say about this body, not Judge Southwick. Now, the other case, he was sitting in judgment of an administrative board that decided not to dismiss an employee who used a racial slur in the workplace. To suggest that by somehow giving deference to the administrative board, whether or not their decision was capricious and arbitrary--the review standard at the appellate level--he embraces this term or is intolerant is equally ridiculous. I have an administrative board in the State of Mississippi that is an expert in the area of employment discrimination law, hiring and firing practices. The case is decided at the administrative level, and it comes up to appeal, and every judge involved says this is a terrible word to use but, as a matter of law, the board's finding it was an isolated incident did not justify a complete dismissal was the issue in the case. Now, do we really want to create a situation in this country where the judges who want to get promoted will not render justice or apply the law, that they will be worried about themselves and what somebody may say about the context of the case? Are we going to get so that you cannot represent someone? What about the person who was being accused of the racial slur? What if you had represented them? Would we come here on the floor of the Senate saying: My God, you represented someone who said a terrible thing; therefore, you can't be a judge? I don't know about you, but as a lawyer, I have represented some pretty bad people. It was my job. And judges have to apply the law and use their best judgment. So I hope this man will get an up-or-down vote and that this garbage we are throwing at our nominees will stop.","word.count":841,"sep11":6.2752808988764,"years":2008.13483146067,"days":4676,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.23441191759626,"Topic 2":0.321560988832507,"Topic 3":0.0146531555501862,"Topic 4":0.0155221933577534,"Topic 5":0.0180901053304989,"Topic 6":0.00836573819911443,"Topic 7":0.00833933192950044,"Topic 8":0.047564924749855,"Topic 9":0.0476135626563391,"Topic 10":0.283878081797986},{"id":"11020070078426","body":"Jim Bunning: Madam President, words cannot express how sad I am that my good friend Craig Thomas passed away last night. We will all truly miss his tenacious advocacy on issues, his incredible sense of humor, and his upstanding character and integrity. The Senate will not be the same without him. I have known Craig for almost 20 years. I first became friends with him when we both served in the House of Representatives. We continued our friendship in the Senate, where I had the great fortune of serving with him on both the Senate Finance and Senate Energy Committees. Craig was a tireless advocate for Wyoming issues. He was an effective leader in energy, public lands, tax, trade, health, and rural community issues. We stood side by side on many issues, and I always felt we could accomplish any project because I had Craig by my side. He and I worked closely on energy issues in both committees. Craig was skilled at keeping his eyes on the details that mattered to the people back home in Wyoming. Recently, we worked together on a small issue in the landmark Energy Policy Act of 2005 that he helped craft. We learned that western coals, because of their naturally low sulfur content, would be excluded from certain clean coal programs for failing to remove the high percentage mandated by the bill. This was one of those little things that slipped by many people but not Craig. We have already fixed the problem in the Tax Code and are now working to do the same in the Energy Committee. It was the little things he did for the people of Wyoming that made him such a great Senator for his State. Craig also pushed to make sure that both his State and the Nation had an effective energy policy. Just a couple of weeks ago, Craig and I sponsored an amendment during markup of the Energy Committee biofuels bill to attempt to push coal-to-liquids technology into reality. Thomas believed this would help both the people of Wyoming by providing more jobs and cheaper energy costs and would help the Nation by reducing our reliance on Middle East oil. And although this amendment failed in committee, his dogged determination showed through because he planned to continue fighting this issue on the Senate floor. My thoughts and prayers go out to his wife Susan and his children, Lexie, Greg, Patrick, and Peter. They have shown incredible courage and strength the past few months. I am honored to have known Senator Thomas. He impacted all of our lives and will be sorely missed.","word.count":435,"sep11":5.87921348314607,"years":2007.73876404494,"days":4535,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0169400340651662,"Topic 2":0.0167815422135179,"Topic 3":0.0424090798051289,"Topic 4":0.00494367317385128,"Topic 5":0.0785998732864378,"Topic 6":0.00643595619752151,"Topic 7":0.0112169491923004,"Topic 8":0.79591945843242,"Topic 9":0.00574666663270134,"Topic 10":0.0210067670009546},{"id":"10619990079152","body":"Phil Gramm: Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation.

I am currently a cosponsor of H.R. 2709 . The potential for a strategic arms race in Asia, evidenced by the nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan, means that we must redouble our efforts to combat the proliferation of nuclear weapons around the world. H.R. 2709 would require the administration to publish periodic reports identifying companies or research institutes that have transferred, or have attempted to transfer, to Iran prohibited missile- related technology since August 8, 1995  . In other words, this sanctions bill is intended to close loopholes in the United States' counterproliferation laws in order to address the risk that Iran may soon obtain from firms in Russia, and elsewhere, the capability of producing its own medium- and long-range ballistic missiles, thus creating a threat to stability in the Middle East and southern Europe. With respect to Russia, the proliferation threat seems to stem from two complex issues: Since the dissolution of the former U.S.S.R., the Russian government has been unable to pay its scientists, engineers and academics whose former careers are virtually nonexistent today. Some have lent their skills, for pay, to help produce ballistic missiles. Second, Russia is having difficulty enforcing its own arms control laws, which ban defense experts and scientists from selling their services abroad for at least five years, as effectively as it can. For example, a columnist for The Washington Post reported in January that about $30 billion worth of illegal exports and imports flowed across Russia's once tightly sealed borders last year. In total, this smuggling and other underground activity account for 40 percent of the Russian economy today. In short, the threat is as much a human problem as it is an actual weapons problem. It should be clear to everyone that it is in the interests of the United States and Russia to prevent nuclear material and missile technology from being smuggled across Russia's borders. Thus, this problem encompasses both a human and material component. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to take a concrete step to halt the spread of weapons of mass destruction by supporting the Senate amendments to H.R. 2709.","word.count":374,"sep11":-3.34269662921348,"years":1998.51685393258,"days":1252,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0404570556044793,"Topic 2":0.231845660292634,"Topic 3":0.0325647536128526,"Topic 4":0.00363420414019093,"Topic 5":0.193646794734357,"Topic 6":0.0107235263218709,"Topic 7":0.422937052680249,"Topic 8":0.0483634226990702,"Topic 9":0.00731941213946957,"Topic 10":0.00850811777482608},{"id":"10419950090374","body":"John McCain: Mr. President, I support the efforts of my colleague from South Carolina, Senator Thurmond, to restore funding $104 million in funding for base closure accounts, which the Appropriations Committee recommended for rescission. It is vitally important that these funds remain available to pay for the necessary costs of closing, cleaning up, and transferring unnecessary military bases to the communities for reuse. The Appropriations Committee indicates in the report accompanying the bill that these rescissions are being taken because large amounts of appropriated funds remain unobligated in these accounts. That may be true. But that in no way means that the funds are not necessary. The accounts from which the committee recommended rescinding $104 million include the funding for environmental restoration at closing military bases. These costs are not insignificant, and they represent a Federal liability which must be met. On Monday, March 27, the Washington Post reported on yet another study that concluded that ``the cost of cleaning up military bases is skyrocketing * * *.'' My colleague from Alaska has often raised this problem of the increasing cost of cleaning up closing military bases as a reason to delay the BRAC process. Yet, now the committee is recommending that we rescind funds already appropriated for environmental cleanup at closing military bases. I cannot understand the logic of doing so. These accounts from which the committee recommends we rescind money also include funding to pay for military construction at bases where consolidations and realignments will occur because of BRAC actions. The cost of providing this new infrastructure was factored into the BRAC's decision-making process and is important to provide necessary support for activities moved to other locations. It is not reasonable to assume that adding functions to an existing base will not require some expenditure of funds for buildings and support. All of these funds are necessary to complete the base closure and realignment process. There are specific projects and activities for which these funds were appropriated--jobs which need to be completed so that the communities surrounding the closing bases can implement their reuse plans as quickly as possible. I wonder whether the committee would consider, as a possible reason for the large amount of unobligated balances in these accounts, that the process for closing bases is, without exaggeration, ponderous. In my home State of Arizona, Williams Air Force Base, which was ordered closed in 1991, has been screened for Federal agency reuse at least three times. Homeless applications are still pending at the Department of Health and Human Services. The Air Force Base Conversion Agency and the local communities have not yet agreed on the final details of reuse of the base. Here we are, nearly 4 years after the BRAC ordered the base closed, and the Air Force is still paying the bill for maintaining the base. And more importantly, the community is still not able to recover fully from the economic impact of losing the base. The base closure process ought not take 4 years to complete. I intend to introduce legislation to streamline the Federal screening process and to give greater flexibility to recognized community groups to coordinate, develop,","word.count":523,"sep11":-6.60955056179775,"years":1995.25,"days":89,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0250801245517857,"Topic 2":0.265399734823578,"Topic 3":0.0182704649111235,"Topic 4":0.61213712012569,"Topic 5":0.00666926640478521,"Topic 6":0.00324034785757707,"Topic 7":0.00319176741269124,"Topic 8":0.0257095578110847,"Topic 9":0.00622969728486463,"Topic 10":0.0340719188168197},{"id":"10519980029676","body":"NA","word.count":735,"sep11":-3.18820224719101,"years":1998.67134831461,"days":1307,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0521590771987336,"Topic 2":0.0277566335868302,"Topic 3":0.00325876646593222,"Topic 4":0.00914119635427915,"Topic 5":0.00596910607762607,"Topic 6":0.00259853891750158,"Topic 7":0.00219935976890876,"Topic 8":0.795912216775227,"Topic 9":0.00701733157507719,"Topic 10":0.093987773279884},{"id":"11020070070039","body":"Barack Obama: Mr. President, toward the end of World War II, Norman Rockwell created a cover for the Saturday Evening Post titled ``Homecoming GI.'' It is a picture of a soldier returning from war. He has a duffle bag clutched in his left hand. He is looking up at the back of a brick building with laundry hanging from the back porch. A woman in an apron sees him with outstretched arms, and a young child races down the stairs. Everyone sees that soldier--the neighbors' kids, the man fixing the roof, faces from another window--and everyone welcomes that soldier who has come home from war. That is what our Nation did for the millions of servicemembers who returned from the Atlantic and the Pacific. We watched them come home in waves. Some were just as strong as their first day in battle; others limped. We saw them crowd Times Square. We saw them walk down Main Street and sit on stoops. My grandfather, who fought in Patton's army, would often speak about this time as America at its finest. That homecoming didn't just happen; we were ready for it. Long before the beaches of Normandy were stormed and the last battle was fought, in 1943 President Roosevelt said: These are the words of wisdom that we ignore at our peril. Today we have more than 631,000 veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan and other parts of the global war on terror. According to a recent VA health care report, one-third--more than 205,000--have sought treatment at VA health facilities. Even if the war in Iraq comes to an end soon--and I hope the Senate takes action this week to accomplish that goal--the war will live on with our servicemembers and their families for the rest of our lives. Unfortunately, over the past month, we have all seen the disturbing pictures of neglect at Walter Reed. We have read about bats and bureaucratic redtape at the VA. We have seen too many stories about our veterans who have been forgotten--not greeted by the Nation that asked them to serve. The time has come for us to see this generation of veterans in all their valor and pain. We should provide them with a plan that is worthy of their courage and will help build back the military they love. That is what Senator McCaskill and I are trying to do with the amendment we offer today. First, we provide an additional $41 million to hire more caseworkers to assist servicemembers navigating the military's bureaucracy. The last thing a wounded servicemember should have to face when they return home is a front line of paperwork and delay. Right now, the caseworker- to-service-member ratio at Walter Reed is 1 to 50. Caseworkers help recovering soldiers schedule appointments, take care of their everyday needs, and fill out paperwork. Military caseworkers are overwhelmed. I understand the Army is reducing the caseworker-to-service-member ratio to 1 to 17, and I applaud this move. Our amendment would help the military achieve this goal at all military hospitals. Our amendment also provides $30 million for the Armed Forces to create an Internet-based system for servicemembers to submit their paperwork electronically. No longer will amputees and servicemembers in wheelchairs have to go to countless offices to fill out duplicative forms only to learn that the forms have been lost in Government bureaucracy. We also need to do more to increase the number of mental health crisis counselors available to assist recovering servicemembers and their families. Too many servicemembers are returning home with unmet mental health needs--stresses that are often experienced by their family members. That is why our amendment provides $17 million for more mental health crisis counselors. While we all praise how our country treated the servicemembers returning from World War II, we must remember the lessons after Vietnam. The landmark National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Study was congressionally mandated in 1983, 15 years after the height of that war. The completed report showed the vast majority of Vietnam veterans had successfully acclimated to postwar life. We can't wait 15 years to plan and prepare for the readjustment needs of the servicemembers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. The average age of a servicemember deployed since September 11 is 27. The average age of our Guard and Reserves is 33. Sixty percent of those deployed have family responsibilities, and 47 percent of those who have died have left families. Mr. President, 160,000 women have been deployed, and 10 percent of those women are single mothers. These men and women are going to face real challenges in readjusting to normal life. Our amendment would provide for a study by the National Academy of Sciences of the mental health and readjustment needs of returning servicemembers. This study will assist the Department of Defense, the Veterans' Administration, and Congress in planning for the long-term needs of our veterans. Last week I met a woman at Walter Reed. She is one of the 160,000 women who have been deployed, and she suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. Most of us associate PTSD with men in combat, but many of the women in theater face firsthand dangers in their combat support roles. Driving a truck in Baghdad is one of the most dangerous missions around, and it is considered a support role. Women are witnessing the horrors of improvised explosive devices and the horrors of losing fellow servicemembers, and too many are experiencing the trauma of sexual harassment or abuse. This young woman was very scared, and she trembled as we spoke. I asked her what we could do to help. She said that she could not handle group therapy sessions; she could only tolerate one-on-one sessions with counselors. Her experience is shared by many women. Treatment for women with PTSD, especially sexual abuse victims, is very different from treatment for men. That is why as part of our amendment we want to provide $15 million to address the unique mental health needs of women. This funding will ensure the development and implementation of a women's treatment program for mental health conditions, including PTSD. It will also include the hiring and training of sexual abuse counselors so that the servicemembers who suffer from this trauma do not have to suffer in silence. We can do this for the woman I met at Walter Reed and the thousands who suffer like her. The total cost of our amendment is $103 million--less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the total cost of this bill. This is the least we can do for our servicemembers recovering at Walter Reed and other military hospitals. I am proud that Veterans For America has endorsed our amendment, and I ask unanimous consent that their letter of endorsement be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:","word.count":1141,"sep11":5.68258426966292,"years":2007.54213483146,"days":4465,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.130644674681813,"Topic 2":0.0974363699336033,"Topic 3":0.410671376419389,"Topic 4":0.242908605114392,"Topic 5":0.0166235236357047,"Topic 6":0.0277361347111908,"Topic 7":0.0128716740744176,"Topic 8":0.0292968604996323,"Topic 9":0.0151044508912192,"Topic 10":0.0167063300386373},{"id":"10620000066839","body":"Bob Graham: Mr. President, Senator Mack and I offer this amendment that will correct an injustice being done to nursery growers in south Florida impacted by Hurricane Irene in October of 1999. On October 15, Florida was hit with Hurricane Irene. Following closely on the heels of Hurricane Floyd, a storm that caused a disaster declaration in 13 states, Hurricane Irene dropped over nine inches of rainfall on average across Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami-Dade Counties. Three-day rainfall totals at specific measuring sites throughout this area ranged between 10.88 and 17.47 inches. Nineteen Florida counties received a major disaster declaration. At the height of the storm, more than 1 million people lost power. Agriculture losses from Hurricane Irene totaled over $438 million. In total, seven deaths were attributed to Irene's visit to the Florida coastline. Last year, Congress specifically provided $186 million in ``additional resources for damage caused by hurricanes and other natural disasters in Florida and other states'' under Title I-- Emergency Supplemental Appropriations of the FY 2000 Omnibus Appropriations Act. This crop loss assistance was provided in addition to the $1.2 billion previously allocated under the Crop Disaster Program to respond to farmers who suffered losses due to ``adverse weather and related conditions.'' In executing this program, the Farm Service Agency has made the determination that nursery, unlike other Florida crops damaged by Hurricane Irene, will not be eligible for Crop Disaster Program assistance. FSA indicates that nursery is ineligible because the program is limited to losses in the 1999 crop year, and the hurricane damage occurred after the FSA-set 2000 crop year had begun. The hurricane damage occurred on October 16-17, 1999, and the 2000 nursery crop year, according to FSA, began on October 1, 1999. By all accounts, the FSA's crop year determination was made on an arbitrary basis as nursery does not have a traditional crop year and crops are grown on a year-round basis. By contrast, the Risk Management Agency had a similar problem and made a special dispensation for the nursery crop year to provide eligibility for hurricane losses under the federal crop insurance program. The Florida delegation has made a concerted attempt to work closely with the Department since the hurricane damage occurred. On December 9, 1999 FSA representatives briefed the Florida delegation on disaster assistance available to Florida farmers, and we were informed that Crop Disaster Program assistance would be available to respond to hurricane-related farm losses in Florida. Today, it is still not available. The amendment we offer today will ensure that nursery stock losses due to Hurricane Irene will be eligible for relief under the Crop Disaster Program. Mr. President, the intent of Congress was clear--that losses in Florida due to natural disasters should be covered by the Crop Disaster Program. I hope that my colleagues will support our amendment that will provide clear direction to the U.S. Department of Agriculture and ensure that its actions meet the intent of Congress. I urge its adoption.","word.count":494,"sep11":-1.17415730337079,"years":2000.68539325843,"days":2024,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.232173753066622,"Topic 2":0.155731626184047,"Topic 3":0.0412259945550247,"Topic 4":0.0224205145737635,"Topic 5":0.406748309653594,"Topic 6":0.0187866819156243,"Topic 7":0.0129829591577845,"Topic 8":0.0711211575925765,"Topic 9":0.0170186110875522,"Topic 10":0.0217903922134109},{"id":"10419950042765","body":"David Dreier: I welcome this attitude that we need to try to work out the differences.

The majority party in 1995 tried to shut down the government in order to force President Clinton to cut $270 billion out of Medicare and to make deep cuts in education and health care and a number of other domestic programs just to finance huge tax cuts which were primarily aimed at the highest income Americans. You got burned. Since then, you have been a little shy about attacking education. We have seen charts today that brag about what the Republican Party has done to raise Pell Grants. This chart shows in the blue graphs what the President has asked for in Pell Grants since 1985. The red chart shows what the Republicans have provided, or what the Congress has provided. As you can see, it has been the presidential demand that has driven the number up each year, except for 2 years when the President asked for more money and the majority party one-upped him by a tiny amount of money. So it has been the President driving this upward increase in Pell Grants. The question is not so much what you did yesterday; it is what you are going to do today and tomorrow. In 1976, Pell Grants paid for over 70 percent of the cost of sending a working family's kid to college. Today it pays for less than 40 percent. We think now that we have surpluses instead of deficits we ought to do something about that. We are afraid that you are not going to make higher education a priority because your standard bearer, George Bush, said on March 22: ``Higher education is not my priority.'' He also said when he came to my State, when he was asked by a student, what are you going to do about the huge debt overhang that kids have when they leave college, he said, and this is an exact quote: ``Too bad. That is what loans are; they are to be paid back. There is a lot of money out there, if you just go looking for it. Some of you are just going to have to pay it back, and that is just the way it is.'' That is a ``let them eat cake'' attitude, and we do not subscribe to it.

Unfortunately, for millions of people in public housing, this dream has little chance of becoming reality, because they don't earn enough to get out of public housing. As a result, Mr. Speaker, the U.S. taxpayer covers the cost of public housing because millions of working poor don't make enough money to pay rent and put food on the table. A large part of the reason for this is our tragically low minimum wage. We could do a great deal to move people out of public housing by increasing the minimum wage to a level where people can earn enough to move out on their own. Unfortunately, the Republican leadership is so opposed to raising the minimum wage that they would rather kick the working poor into the streets. Mr. Speaker, this bill misses the point. The way we reduce the need for public housing is to give people a living wage. And today's minimum wage is certainly not a living wage.","word.count":203,"sep11":-6.68820224719101,"years":1995.17134831461,"days":61,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.189435444067362,"Topic 2":0.319632948372715,"Topic 3":0.00803832861548372,"Topic 4":0.0166580646309485,"Topic 5":0.0112306584805583,"Topic 6":0.00798758296322888,"Topic 7":0.403505285888876,"Topic 8":0.00891094859602147,"Topic 9":0.0307534278223414,"Topic 10":0.00384731056246429},{"id":"10720020031394","body":"Patrick Leahy: Mr. President, I had the privilege to be presiding while the distinguished Senator from Iowa was speaking of the work he has done putting together this farm bill. I listened. I have been chairman of the Agriculture Committee on one occasion, ranking member on another occasion, when we had to put through the 5-year farm bill. I have worked with the distinguished chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, and now Presiding Officer, for over 20 years between the House and the Senate. I know how hard it is to put such a bill together. The distinguished Senator from Iowa worked very closely with all Members--both Republicans and Democrats--in meeting after meeting, conversation after conversation, on the floor, in their offices, in the Senate dining room, walking across the Hill. I have been privy to a number of those conversations. A farm bill has a number of diverse aspects to it. The President seems to wrap everything into some kind of sense of patriotism. We have to be patriotic. We have to have a missile defense system to be patriotic, we have to pass tax credits. Incidentally, the last tax cut and stimulus package they proposed would have given, I believe, a quarter of a billion dollars to Enron. I am not quite sure just what kind of patriotism comes out of giving another $250 million of taxpayers' money to Enron. Maybe it is because I come from Vermont and not Texas, but it didn't seem all that patriotic. But I digress. The point is, everybody in this body is patriotic, Republicans and Democrats. Why don't we just acknowledge that. We wouldn't be here otherwise. Let's think, though, what that means. That means protecting all aspects of our country. The United States is the only significant power in the world able to feed itself and still export food--billions of dollars worth of food. That is part of our national security. We are not energy sufficient. Maybe someday we will be, if we do a better job of conservation. We are food sufficient. We are a nation of over a quarter of a billion people and we can feed ourselves from within our own borders, and that will continue to be true if we continue the incentives that keep people on the land, keep the land productive, protect the environment for farmers so they can keep that land productive, and to be able to tell farmers: You will work hard and long, but you will be able to make a living out of it, your kids can go to college, someday you will be able to retire--all the things people desire. I hope as we go forward the White House would realize we are all in this together. We are not talking about a partisan farm bill. One of the things I have enjoyed the most, serving for 27 years now on the Agriculture Committee, is the bipartisanship of that committee. I value my friendship with the current chairman. I value my friendship with the former chairman, Senator Lugar. They are two of the closest friends I have in this body. I remember Hubert Humphrey, George McGovern, and Bob Dole working closely together on nutrition matters. This is a diverse group, but I think one thing that united them was their great sense of humor and a passion, a special passion for feeding the children of this country. There have been bipartisan coalitions on that committee ever since I came here. There was a bipartisan coalition that started the WIC Program, one of the best things for children, for pregnant women, for women post partum, after giving birth. These are programs that have come out of there--the School Lunch Program, which has improved the nutrition of our children and is now considered just a staple of Government. Yet as Harry Truman knew at the time of World War II, so many people were rejected for the draft because of lack of nutrition, so he started the School Lunch Program. I say this to commend the tremendous work of the Senator from Iowa. I am proud of him. I am proud to be his friend. I am proud to serve as a member of his committee. With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.","word.count":714,"sep11":0.421348314606742,"years":2002.2808988764,"days":2592,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.180668870800743,"Topic 2":0.10073100775843,"Topic 3":0.0482053564738468,"Topic 4":0.0125842480900396,"Topic 5":0.0943742682083512,"Topic 6":0.180102124855534,"Topic 7":0.0604101782235641,"Topic 8":0.273305150877863,"Topic 9":0.0438962769012279,"Topic 10":0.00572251781040046},{"id":"10619990011597","body":"Cass Ballenger: Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Resolution 456. The Arapahoe Rescue Patrol is a professional search and rescue team headquartered in Littleton, Colorado, in the district of the gentleman from Colorado . It was founded in 1957 and has provided service to the community for the past 43 years. The Arapahoe Rescue Patrol is unique in that its membership is restricted to young adults currently in high school. The patrol, which has approximately 75 active members, is primarily a search and rescue organization but it also supports local fire departments and law enforcement organizations. In 1998, the Patrol participated in 82 search-related activities and spent 52 days searching for missing persons. While the service of the Arapahoe Rescue Patrol is clearly valuable to constituents represented by our colleague from Colorado, I believe that we can all learn a lesson from their activities. What is unique about this patrol in particular is that it is all high school age membership. Littleton's young people, who successfully complete the training for membership in the Patrol, are unselfishly contributing to their community. This after-school program is certainly exemplary and offers a positive image of our youth. This sense of community worth and value is something that should exist in all areas of our country.

It has strong bipartisan support. The purpose of this amendment is to provide $10 million for the establishment of a Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve. Stand-alone legislation that I introduced back in February, calling for a 6.7 million barrel home heating oil reserve, garnered 98 cosponsors, including 24 Republicans and 27 Members who are not from the Northeast. In addition, and importantly, authorizing legislation that passed the House by an overwhelming vote of 416 to 8 included language to establish a home heating oil reserve in the Northeast. Not only does this amendment enjoy strong bipartisan support, it also has the backing of the Clinton administration. Let me just quote from a letter that I received yesterday from Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson. ``The floor amendment you intend to offer to the Interior, Related Agencies appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001 would appropriate $10 million for the home heating oil reserve. As you are aware, the House recently passed H.R. 2884, reauthorizing the Energy Policy and Conservation Act with the added provision to create such a reserve. Your amendment, therefore, is consistent with both the President's proposal and the views expressed previously by the House and I support your amendment.'' That is from Bill Richardson. Mr. Chairman, it is obvious to everyone that we are experiencing an energy crisis in this country. The price of gasoline is skyrocketing. We are feeling that all over the country. This can only mean one thing. If we do not act forcefully now, next winter we are going to have a disaster on our hands that was worse than last winter, which was a real tragedy for millions of people. Mr. Chairman, we must make certain that the huge increases in home heating oil prices that we experienced last winter does not happen again. Not this winter, not any winter. Mr. Chairman, let me be clear that this is not just an issue that affects the northeast. A home heating oil reserve would also provide positive benefits to the entire country. Since diesel and jet fuel can be used as a substitute for heating oil, industry experts believe that if a heating oil reserve were in place, not only would the price of heating oil be reduced, but diesel and jet fuel prices would also be reduced all over the country. Mr. Chairman, winter is not a natural disaster. We in Vermont know, and I think the rest of the country knows, that it takes place every year. Yet we continue to be unprepared for a severely cold winter. In fact, fuel oil shortages have taken place in the Northeast about once every 3 years. Most recently these shortages have occurred during the winters of 1983, 1984, 1988, 1989, 1996, 1997, 1999, and 2000. Enough is enough. Mr. Chairman, the offset for this amendment is a pretty conservative one, and it is a simple one. It should not meet much controversy. If this amendment passes, $10 million of the $157 million already in the bill for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve would be used for the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve. So this is more of an accounting transfer than a real significant offset. We are taking money out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. There is $157 million in it. We are moving $10 million over for the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve. Mr. Chairman, this is a sensible approach to protect millions of people who really were hurt last winter and in the past by skyrocketing home heating oil costs, and I would hope that we can win strong bipartisan support for it.","word.count":652,"sep11":-1.27247191011236,"years":2000.58707865169,"days":1989,"party":"Other","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0669459314981223,"Topic 2":0.036363308593037,"Topic 3":0.312025632558219,"Topic 4":0.212460162069591,"Topic 5":0.181386694069401,"Topic 6":0.00410627999728389,"Topic 7":0.00211268119568169,"Topic 8":0.151274180340671,"Topic 9":0.00270930744358327,"Topic 10":0.0306158222344099},{"id":"10820030023264","body":"James Oberstar: Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr. Chairman, this amendment prohibits the use of funds in this bill to pay for outsourcing food stamp call center jobs to foreign countries. We used to have amendments on these bills that were identified ``Buy American.'' Today I offer one to ``Hire an American.'' It would basically change the behavior of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and our respective States that receive food stamp dollars and in turn are outsourcing the call center jobs associated with food stamps to Mexico and to India and to other foreign countries. The Richmond Times Dispatch reported in March that 38 States had been exporting our jobs since 2001. Since then we have learned from the Congressional Research Service that in fact 42 States have outsourced some part of their food stamp call center operations. Think about that. The calls relate to food stamps for people inside the United States of America. Only Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, Ohio, Texas, and Wyoming have their call centers exclusively inside the United States. Other States are beginning to look at this issue and take action, but this deserves national attention since these are dollars that fund the food stamp programs in all of our States. It is also ironic that the biggest account in this entire bill is the food stamp program, ringing in at $33 billion being paid out to needy Americans. Given the complexity that some people face when trying to complete those applications or find out where there may be stores that accept electronic benefit technology, you would expect that our constituents would be able to reach someone in their own community or our States who might be better able to relate to the problems that they are facing in their own lives. So we provide $33 billion for food stamps to all of our States, and that is a program that has increased 46 percent in just the last 4 years. Many banking companies have become the intermediaries that are administrating the food stamp program and end up putting those jobs in other countries. Would it not be better use of American taxpayer funds to try to hire unemployed individuals? In fact, some of those receiving food stamps who could get off these food stamps by having good jobs at these call centers.","word.count":248,"sep11":1.8876404494382,"years":2003.74719101124,"days":3114,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.114662551283935,"Topic 2":0.313537668300182,"Topic 3":0.0173649234736751,"Topic 4":0.0151827374072546,"Topic 5":0.491679655134356,"Topic 6":0.00652348678599238,"Topic 7":0.00668048419232675,"Topic 8":0.0190434899960133,"Topic 9":0.00644819179684249,"Topic 10":0.0088768116294212},{"id":"10820030085352","body":"Harry Reid: Mr. President, I, of course, am also happy about the growth of the domestic product last quarter.

Tragically, this past weekend we had a number of tornados, I believe, or windstorms throughout the Midwest, loss of life, a loss of property. These are regional climatic issues that come about.

I commend the chairman, Senator Specter, and the ranking member, Senator Harkin, for their work to increase funding for the National Institutes of Health. As all of us know, Congress is on track toward doubling the funding for important health research and investigation through the NIH. That is critically important to this country. I am one of those who has been supportive of doubling the funding for the National Institutes of Health. The NIH is trying to unlock the mystery of many of the diseases that ravage the bodies of people who are suffering from Parkinson's disease, cancer, heart disease, and so many other diseases that afflict the American people and people around the globe. The type of research that is taking place at the National Institutes of Health is exciting and vibrant and paying big dividends. I thought I would mention, as I start, something I saw one day at the NIH called the healing garden. This was an exhibit out at the NIH campus where they had a series of plants growing in this aquarium-like device called the healing garden. I asked the folks at NIH for an explanation, and they told me about it. They said a lot of people think modern medicines, especially the medicines that are developed through research at NIH to respond to the challenges of treating diseases, come from chemicals. But they told me that a lot of medicines come from natural substances we find all over the Earth. They were displaying some of those substances in this healing garden. I want to describe a couple of the things they were displaying because it is interesting. NIH is gathering from around the world 50,000 to 60,000 different species of plants, shrubs, and trees and testing and evaluating what kind of properties they have to heal and treat diseases. The common aspirin comes from the bark of a willow tree. The Chinese knew that a couple of thousand years ago. If they had a headache, they would chew the bark of a willow tree. In modern medicine, aspirin is a chemical modification of that active ingredient derived from willow tree bark. Now aspirin is produced chemically, but the bark of the willow tree was the derivative. The java devil pepper was in the healing garden. Drugs used to treat hypertension, or high blood pressure, which were used formerly as a tranquilizer, come from the java devil pepper. Who would have guessed this connection if not for the research by the scientists who discovered it? Agents that fight tumors, leukemias or lymphomas, come from the plant called the mayapple. The rose periwinkle produces drugs used as anticancer agents primarily in treating Hodgkin's disease and a variety of lymphomas and leukemias. Foxglove is used in the medications digitalis and digitoxin, which are used to treat congestive heart failure and other cardiac disorders. Of course, we all know about aloe, an active ingredient, of course, in skin care preparations. It is interesting that, as funding has increased for studying plants and animals, scientists at the NIH are finding quite remarkable things. Deep in the Amazon rain forest lives a frog that has a deadly toxin on its skin. They believe that from studying the toxin of that frog, they can create a painkiller that is 200 times more powerful than morphine and not addictive. Think of that: 200 times more powerful than morphine and not addictive. There is another frog which is very rare that has a toxin on its skin that is so deadly that a drop of it on the skin of a human being causes the heart to stop. The scientists asked the question: If there is something this powerful that it causes a human heart to stop, can we unleash the power of that toxin to do something positive? That is the kind of evaluation and study that is occurring at the NIH routinely. As we double the funding for the National Institutes of Health, there are all of these wonderful scientists and researchers doing this massive amount of research--research to decode the human genome, research to grow new heart valves around parts of the heart muscle that are clogged, deep brain research to uncover the secrets of Parkinson's disease. As all of this research occurs through the doubling of funding at NIH, we should say thanks to Senator Harkin and Senator Specter for their leadership and commitment over several years to move this Congress to invest in these efforts that are so important to this country's future. Now, let me go from that compliment to talking about how this research is dispersed across this country. There is a trend for how this research funding is allocated throughout the country that is very similar to what happens in other areas of the federal Government's research budget. The research that comes through the billions and billions of dollars that we spend--nearly $20 billion proposed for fiscal year 2001 at the NIH alone --has historically been clustered in a few areas of the country. In most cases, big universities get big grants that make them bigger, and from around those universities, you see the development of businesses springing up from that research. You will see the result of NIH research in a few areas of the country producing very significant opportunities. Then you will see other significant parts of America with almost no research base through the NIH. Should research be done where it is done best? Yes, of course. But the largest universities in this country, in a handful of States, get most of the research dollars in part because the grants are peer reviewed by people from the same institutions that get the grants in the first place. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. The chart I have here shows the way NIH funding is currently distribution across the country. If you look at the States in this country shown in the white shaded areas--mostly in the middle of the country--you will see that these States get very little funding for medical research. The States shown in the blue and red areas--California, Texas, New York, Massachusetts, and so on--are the States that get most of the research grants. This pie graph here shows what happens as a result of this imbalance. As you can see, three States get 35 percent of all of the medical research funds provided by the NIH. Institutions in three States get over a third of all the Federal dollars on medical research. In fact, one state alone received 15 percent of total NIH funds. This little white slice shown on the chart represents 21 States that share only 3 percent of the research. Why does that matter? If you live in one of these States, and you have Parkinson's disease, or you have breast cancer, or you have any one of a number of very serious health problems, and you want to participate in the cutting-edge medical research conducted by the NIH through one of its grantees, you may well have to travel hundreds and hundreds or perhaps thousands of miles to avail yourself of the clinical trials. Second, there are wonderful institutions in the middle part of America that have the capability to provide unique and beneficial research on a range of issues ranging from cancer, to heart disease, to diabetes, and more through the funds we are providing at NIH. But they do not get the opportunity because the system is stacked against them. At the NIH, we have a program called IDeA, or the Institutional Development Award program, that is intended to rectify this geographical inequity by helping historically under funded states to build their medical research capacity. IDeA is very similar to the EPSCoR program that exists in other federal agencies. This program is under funded at NIH. The IDeA program is funded at the level of $100 million in the House-passed bill, which I think is too low. But it is funded at only $60 million here. That is an increase from $40 million to $60 million, and for that, I appreciate the efforts of Senators Specter and. But we ought to at least meet the House level. And we ought to do even more. My amendment will take our proposed funding to the level of $100 million in the House bill. Through this amendment, we will simply say that we want to encourage the distribution of research across this country to all of the centers of genius--no matter where they are--that exist. In States such as North Dakota, Iowa, South Dakota, and up and down the farm belt, we are losing a lot of population. This map shows that. All these red blotches on this map indicate counties that have lost more than 10 percent of their population. What you see is that the middle part of our country is being systematically depopulated. Why has that happened? Why, when you have so many people living on top of each other in apartment buildings in big cities and fighting through traffic jams just to get to and from work each day, is the middle part of our country being depopulated? At least part of the answer to that question relates back to what we do at the Federal level. We say that $20 billion will be made available through the National Institutes of Health to form centers of excellence for scientific research in medicine. We move that money to specific areas of the country where there is already a significant population, and from that springs economic opportunity and biotechnology companies and new jobs. We simply exacerbate all of these problems with the way we spend our money at the Federal Government. There are centers of genius in the middle part of this country, in Minnesota and North Dakota and South Dakota and Kansas and Oklahoma. There are small centers of excellence that could do wonderful scientific research, but they do not get the funding. Why? Because the biggest States get all the money. Three States get a third of all the money through the NIH. I am not suggesting that anything illegal is going on. It is just that we have a system that perpetuates itself and creates a circumstance where three States ","word.count":2099,"sep11":-1.25,"years":2000.6095505618,"days":1997,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.880952645416831,"Topic 2":0.04016705339128,"Topic 3":0.00823938990249725,"Topic 4":0.0187790824493922,"Topic 5":0.00824715546722053,"Topic 6":0.00953654649692646,"Topic 7":0.00654722226492451,"Topic 8":0.0147723054137499,"Topic 9":0.00917015164591598,"Topic 10":0.00358844755126213},{"id":"10720010033349","body":"Jack Kingston: Without objection, it is so ordered","word.count":132,"sep11":0.25561797752809,"years":2002.11516853933,"days":2533,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.425876696841734,"Topic 2":0.0436099968797714,"Topic 3":0.183047107481682,"Topic 4":0.132106932939197,"Topic 5":0.0133881740888776,"Topic 6":0.0216315941365128,"Topic 7":0.0137106761699143,"Topic 8":0.0878196605723666,"Topic 9":0.0666456189118345,"Topic 10":0.01216354197811},{"id":"10419950100286","body":"Bennett Johnston: Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce, along with several of my colleagues, the Wetlands Regulatory Reform Act of 1995. I am particularly pleased to have as the lead cosponsor Senator Faircloth, the chairman of the subcommittee of the Environment and Public Works Committee that has jurisdiction over wetlands. Our bill will reform the section 404 ``wetlands'' permitting program under the Clean Water Act by introducing balance, common sense, and reason to a Federal program that is causing unnecessary problems for my constituents--and I believe for many of our citizens around the Nation. In the closing days of the last Congress, I introduced a wetlands bill, S. 2506, so that my colleagues and other interested persons could review the legislation and recommend improvements prior to reintroduction in the 104th Congress. I appreciate the efforts of those who took the time over the last few months to provide suggestions, many of which are reflected in the current bill. Mr. President, the current section 404 regulatory program has been designed less by the elected representatives of the people than by officials of the Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency and by Federal judges. In 1972, the Congress enacted the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Section 404 of that Act prohibited ``discharges of dredged or fill material'' into ``waters of the United States;'' without a permit from the Secretary of the Army. At the time of passage, ``waters of the United States'' was thought to be limited to the navigable waters of the Nation. From this narrow beginning has come a rigid regulatory program that is devaluing property and preventing the construction of housing, the extension of airport runways, the construction of roads--often on lands that rarely, if ever, have water on the surface but which, nevertheless, are viewed as ``wetlands'' within the definition of ``waters of the United States''. And I might add, Mr. President, that 75 percent of the land that is being regulated through the Section 404 program as ``wetlands'' or ``waters of the United States'' is privately-owned property. I do not believe that we, in Congress, intended for the Section 404 program to become a rigid, broad Federal land use program that affects primarily privately-owned property. Yet, the evidence is clear to me that the Section 404 program has become just that. Therefore, Mr. President, I believe that the time has come for the Congress to reform this program to focus Federal regulatory authority on those wetlands that are truly important functioning wetlands, to ensure that our citizens can obtain permits through a reasonable process within a reasonable period of time, and to ensure that this program is not denying people the use of their property unless there is an overriding reason to do so. Mr. President, the Wetlands Regulatory Reform Act of 1995 proposes several key changes to the current 404 program: First, the bill provides a statutory definition of a jurisdictional wetland. This is, of course, the crucial threshold question: what wetlands are subject to Federal regulation? And yet, one can read the entire Clean Water Act without finding the answer to this question. Instead, the answer currently lies only in a manual prepared by the Corps of Engineers in 1987. I think it is high","word.count":542,"sep11":-6.46348314606742,"years":1995.39606741573,"days":141,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0530457208298153,"Topic 2":0.0100130681724472,"Topic 3":0.0913507946438586,"Topic 4":0.0514727879783387,"Topic 5":0.00345693893777348,"Topic 6":0.421478368780075,"Topic 7":0.130038338901554,"Topic 8":0.192133618079398,"Topic 9":0.0442611539336423,"Topic 10":0.00274920974309796},{"id":"10820030011687","body":"Sheila Jackson-Lee: Would Members please remove their electronic devices from the floor or turn them off.","word.count":286,"sep11":1.6938202247191,"years":2003.55337078652,"days":3045,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0576612745975435,"Topic 2":0.220501064907572,"Topic 3":0.0323905186981073,"Topic 4":0.396535913527201,"Topic 5":0.0169662941486028,"Topic 6":0.0188325041609378,"Topic 7":0.0186870682088748,"Topic 8":0.161974949619551,"Topic 9":0.0658391147269398,"Topic 10":0.0106112974046706},{"id":"11020080001226","body":"James E.

As my colleagues know, I have the distinction of being the author of the law that opened the Office of National Drug Control Policy. It took more than a decade worth of effort to start this office--the Reagan administration opposed my every effort to have a Drug Director. It was not until 1988 that they finally relented. Let me also offer a little history about why the Drug Office staff was reduced in the first place. Under the previous administration, the Drug Office had become overrun with political appointees. Frankly, it became a political dumping ground with the greatest percentage of political appointees of any Cabinet agency. This was not the only reason for the reduction in staff, but it was the key reason I did not oppose the reduction. But, today we have a new Drug Director, an accomplished, impressive general who has been tasked with the difficult job of bringing action to our national effort against drugs. The General has asked for, and the President has formally requested, an additional $3.9 million to increase the staff by 80 personnel.

You and I have argued that the protection of our public health and environment, EPA's mandate, is as important as the congressional mandates which guide other Cabinet-level agencies. If the EPA enjoyed the same status as the Department of Energy or the Interior Department, maybe EPA's policies would carry the day occasionally. As things stand, EPA is certainly losing the battle within this administration from clean air to climate change to snowmobiles in our national parks. EPA's views are overridden, undervalued, and watered down. Take the issue of snowmobiles in Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks. I have spoken about these issues before. I have offered amendments that have been adopted in this regard. Snowmobiling in Yellowstone National Park and Grand Teton National Park has become popular in recent years; so popular, in fact, that the activities overwhelm the parks, its employees, and its wildlife. Up to 1,000 snowmobilers enter the Yellowstone Park on winter weekends, most of them through the gateway community of West Yellowstone, MT. On steel cold days, a visible haze hangs over the park's gate and surrounding area. Rangers at this park wore Park Service-issued respirators this winter because the air quality had been so degraded by emissions from snowmobile engines. I repeat, park rangers at Yellowstone National Park wore respirators because the air was so bad because of snowmobiles. These respirators were issued by the Park Service. What have we come to when rangers have to wear a respirator in our national parks? At the very least, it is an embarrassment. I think it is a tragedy. EPA, the protector of the air we breathe, wisely advocated banning snowmobiles due to their air quality impacts, but those were not the only impacts EPA raised. Snowmobiles also stress Yellowstone's wildlife. The noise generated by so many snowmobiles, coupled with the vehicle's capacity to reach speeds of up to 90 miles an hour, force the park's wildlife, to say the least, to expend valuable energy to avoid contact with these snowmobilers. The National Park Service studied the snowmobiles' impact on the parks for the better part of 10 years, receiving hundreds of thousands of public comments on this subject. The comment included those from the EPA. As I have said, EPA recommended a ban based on air quality concerns. In November of 2000, the Park Service ordered the snowmobiles be gradually phased out in Yellowstone National Park and Grand Teton National Park and the 8-mile road connecting the two. By the year 2004, snowmobiles would be banned completely from these parks. With so many proconservation Clinton-era policies, the Bush administration balked at implementing this rule. With the snowmobile industry in mind, rather than the millions of Americans who visit our parks, the White House ordered the Park Service to restudy the impact of snowmobiles on park resources. The writing was on the wall that this administration expected the Park Service to reach a different conclusion when it reexamined the data. Perhaps they hoped the evidence would support the position they favored, some sort of a faith-based approach to science. As part of the new review, EPA had the integrity and the courage to stick to the position it held throughout the history of this debate. I commend Governor Whitman for that. In its public comments, EPA repeated the assertion from 3 years ago that banning snowmobiles is the best available protection for air quality and health of workers and visitors alike. EPA said even a limited number of snowmobiles may violate air quality standards. I ask unanimous consent that the comments of the Environmental Protection Agency to the Assistant Superintendent at Grand Teton National Park setting out their position be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:","word.count":652,"sep11":0.671348314606742,"years":2002.5308988764,"days":2681,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.228316445282153,"Topic 2":0.0245049464623937,"Topic 3":0.0739969716705995,"Topic 4":0.0239653405567262,"Topic 5":0.0307806770396299,"Topic 6":0.375649161949049,"Topic 7":0.00564301518199101,"Topic 8":0.129239628794338,"Topic 9":0.103019315411156,"Topic 10":0.00488449765196286},{"id":"10419950007033","body":"James E.

It is here in America.","word.count":269,"sep11":3.88202247191011,"years":2005.74157303371,"days":3824,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0908300755549522,"Topic 2":0.00684628068704896,"Topic 3":0.0141603770337963,"Topic 4":0.525498932182296,"Topic 5":0.00950217418985622,"Topic 6":0.00814162537360384,"Topic 7":0.0142859929103005,"Topic 8":0.182459322740547,"Topic 9":0.0980789528312327,"Topic 10":0.0501962664963667},{"id":"10720010048011","body":"Trent Lott: The system that is most developed is one I mentioned previously, the PAC-3 system. It is a theater missile system. It is not designed to counter long-range threats. It has been tested rigorously. It is in operational testing now. Phil Coyle states that the administration is considering an advanced version of PAC-3 for a national missile defense. But if you were trying to use it in a terminal phase it would take many systems to defend a rather small area of the United States. We probably would never have the number of systems needed to adequately defend the United States. Another system we have been developing for years is the THAAD system. Phil Coyle states that the Administration is also considering use of THAAD along with PAC-3 for national missile defense. But in its current configuration THAAD is not ready for this role. In fact, it is far away from it--perhaps a decade before it could be reasonably used in that way. The other system being developed as we speak is a Navy theater-wide system. It is a midcourse system as it is currently designed. They are now talking about this system as a potential element of their midcourse national missile defense. Again, there are still significant issues with respect to the use of this system for national missile defense. As Mr. Coyle points out, if the system were to be used for a midcourse mission, or a boost phase mission, for national missile defense, it would require a new missile that is twice as fast as any existing version of the standard missile which the system now uses. He writes it would require: It is interesting to note that this system is being considered today by the Missile Defense Agency for possible deployment in 2004. It is also interesting, and a bit surprising, because in last year's authorization bill we asked the Missile Defense Agency to tell us what they propose to do with the Navy theater-wide system. We asked for a report on April 30. The response to our request was actually a letter that came to us on May 30, and repeated the questions we asked. It responded to some of the questions in a very cursory way. It didn't give any life cycle cost for us, so it is hard for us to estimate how much this new evolving system will cost. It simply said they redefined the system. That was May 30. Yet, about 2\\1/2\\ weeks later, they were telling the press that we are deploying this system in 2004. In fact, one of the points they made in the letter is: So this work is going to be completed in planning by 2003. Yet this system is being talked about for deployment in 2004. It just does not seem to make much sense, and it illustrates, I think, the problem we have had in the subcommittee, first of getting reliable information, and second of getting a sense of the direction of all these programs. We are not trying to micromanage the Missile Defense Agency, but when we asked a year ago in our report for information specifically about a type of missile system, when we get a cursory response saying, we have renamed it and we will not be able to tell you anything until we conclude in December of 2003 our deliberations, and then 2 weeks later they are talking about the system being deployed in a theater role in 2004, it illustrates, I think, the problems and the issues we have confronted with simply getting the information we need to do our job, to inform our colleagues, to make decisions that are not only important to our national security, but extremely expensive decisions so that we can perform our mission, our role in the Senate. That is the Navy theater wide system. There are other systems we have developed, and I think it is appropriate to note that the next system is the airborne laser system. This is a program to develop a high-power chemical laser that will fit inside a Boeing 747 aircraft. This is a system that would be designed to shoot down short-range enemy missiles in the boost phase. It has some potential, but it is a major technological effort which is going forward, but not going forward with great speed at the moment. The final major component is the national missile defense midcourse, or the land-based system, in Alaska, and that system we have supported. We have supported it, but having supported it, we also have serious questions with it. The system was inaugurated, if you will; at least ground was broken last week for a test bed for missiles. There are concerns that the missiles cannot be effectively used in a flight test capacity because of safety concerns and other factors with respect to the local area in Alaska. That is one issue. The other issue, though, is for several years now in the development of this national missile defense midcourse land-based system in Alaska, the administration and the Missile Defense Agency have talked about using an x-band radar, claiming it as absolutely necessary because of its ability to discriminate the warhead. This is important because the major issue that faces the midcourse intercept is the possibility of countermeasures and decoys. So we need a very fine discriminating radar to determine what is the warhead and what are the decoys. However, That x-band radar has not been funded by the administration. They have declared instead they will use an existing radar, COBRA DANE. One of the problems with COBRA DANE is it faces the wrong way to provide any coverage of Iran or Iraq and provides only limited coverage of North Korea, if you are concerned with the ``evil empire.'' Despite that, and in an effort to support sincerely and consistently the mission of developing adequate national missile defense, we have provided robust funding for the Alaska test bed, and that is included in this bill. However, I do think it is important and appropriate to state our reservations now because they are points we should consider as we go forward. Let me continue to discuss some of the important issues, particularly some of the actions the committee has specifically taken. One thing we should point out is we have looked at the theater missile systems. We have particularly found that the Arrow Missile Defense Program is making great progress. We have increased funding for the Arrow missile system. That is a joint United States-Israeli effort for a theater missile system. We have also fully funded the PAC-3 system, which is the one closest to deployment. It is one that is, again, a theater missile system. In all of our deliberations, we have striven to ensure deployment of these systems in a timely way, but also ensure these systems are operationally tested and rigorously tested before they are put in the field. That is incumbent upon us. We also tried to ensure the independent oversight of the Defense Department's Director of Operational Tests and Evaluation is part of the process. One of the concerns I have, frankly, is that in an attempt by the administration for secrecy and flexibility, we will find a situation in which there is no outside objective voice within the Department of Defense. One that is looking at these programs, advising these programs, and making some judgments that are not influenced by the need for a successful program at any cost, or even a program-- forget successful--at any cost, but are motivated by the need to deploy effective systems that will defend this country. The other factor we considered, and consider constantly, is the discussion of contingency deployments, contingency capabilities. One of the reasons we pause slightly is these contingency capabilities and deployments often result in a rush to failure, often result in a situation where the system is pushed beyond its absolute capabilities. A few years ago, that is exactly what happened with the THAAD Program. It failed its first six intercept tests in a rush to deploy the system before it was ready. The THAAD Program was subsequently totally redone and revamped. It cost hundreds of millions of dollars that were unnecessary expenditures. It is on track now but, frankly, the situation is such that we do not want to repeat that experience in other missile defense programs. We do not want a situation where the pressure for contingency deployments undercuts the need for thorough, deliberate consideration of the operational characters of these systems and the ability of these systems to do the job they are designed to do. We have looked very closely at what we think are attempts to rush the systems. In one area, we have reduced funding of THAAD because they have requested what we consider a premature acquisition of missiles before they have actually had missile's first flight test. We have made that judgment. Let's turn to another aspect of missile defense, and that is the ICBM threat to the United States. It is not as immediate today as the theater missile threat, but it is still a threat. Fortunately, with our new relationship with Russia, the ICBM threat has decreased significantly. China has a small arsenal of ICBMs, but they typically do not have their missiles on ready status, fueled, and with a warhead on the missile. North Korea seems to be developing an ICBM capability of reaching the United States, although it has voluntarily suspended its long-range missile flight test program. There are other potential adversaries. This is an issue about which we are concerned, but one of the things we have to recognize with an ICBM is that its launch leaves an indelible signal of the point of departure and our deterrence doctrine is very clear. We have the capacity to strike back, and strike back with overwhelming force. That has been the hinge, really, of our deterrence policy for 50 or more years, and it remains an important part of our policy. As I have mentioned, the issue of intercontinental ballistic missiles has been with us for many years. We have relied upon deterrence as a mainstay of our defense posture. Today we are developing one system in Alaska that is clearly designed to be a national missile defense system, and this authorization bill s","word.count":116,"sep11":-0.390449438202247,"years":2001.4691011236,"days":2303,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.88921204643269,"Topic 2":0.0360483106573808,"Topic 3":0.00795853380168753,"Topic 4":0.0174849372881596,"Topic 5":0.00770970461907416,"Topic 6":0.00945372815237524,"Topic 7":0.00598362261722167,"Topic 8":0.0145716553364755,"Topic 9":0.00824535678963835,"Topic 10":0.0033321043052977},{"id":"11020070089210","body":"Max Baucus: Mr. President, this is a poison pill.

The Senate passed my bill, S. 2589, by unanimous consent on July 14 of this year, and I am pleased that the House has recently passed H.R. 5365, which closely follows the direction of the Senate legislation. I worked together with fellow Senators, including Senator Graham of Florida, to move this process toward today's hopeful conclusion. I want to stress that this effort has been a very bipartisan effort, in both the House and Senate, to produce a consensus solution and legislation. I also thank Finance Committee Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Baucus for their assistance in bringing this bill to the floor today. This is a bill about protecting the retirement security for thousands of YMCA employees and retirees. I have heard from Kentucky YMCA leaders and employees--leaders such as R. Stephen Tarver of YMCA of Greater Louisville, Dean Ehrenheim of the Owensboro YMCA, and Kenneth Barnes, who runs the Chestnut Street YMCA in Louisville, and countless YMCA employees--about the importance of protecting retirement security. This legislation addresses a concern about the technical status of the YMCA pension plan as a church plan, a type of pension plan offered by churches or associations of churches. This legislation will ensures that the YMCA pension plan will be able to provide a secure retirement to the more than 80,000 plan participants. I also thank the Treasury Department and IRS for their patience while the Congress worked through finding a solution to ensure the YMCA pension plan could continue to offer the benefits to its participants and retirees. As I have stated, the YMCA pension plan is a very significant part of each YMCA employee's compensation package, most of whom are modestly paid. I have heard from many of the Kentucky YMCAs, and their employees, about the importance of this pension plan to their future. In Kentucky alone, there are 19 YMCAs with over 485,000 members, and 918 pension plan participants, retirees or past employees who have vested benefits. Today's legislation is vitally important to the each and every plan participant in Kentucky and their families, and more than 80,000 participants and retirees in the YMCA pension plan, offering them financial and retirement security for their long service on behalf of our Nation's YMCA. In closing, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this bill, and I am pleased that we are moving forward with this legislation today and look forward to its enactment soon.","word.count":1342,"sep11":1.89044943820225,"years":2003.75,"days":3115,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.00957892594371293,"Topic 2":0.236012540720319,"Topic 3":0.00875927922369123,"Topic 4":0.010145316542485,"Topic 5":0.381651077144304,"Topic 6":0.00336068618144937,"Topic 7":0.00464272295812483,"Topic 8":0.164044406697718,"Topic 9":0.029780822353158,"Topic 10":0.152024222235037},{"id":"10720010020972","body":"Cass Ballenger: EHLERS led the charge in blocking the transfer of NIST's Computer Security Division to the new Department.

An amendment in the bill authored by the gentleman from Washington explicitly directs the Under Secretary for Emergency Preparedness and Response to treat the psychological consequences of major disasters and to provide appropriate training for mental health workers who must deal with the aftermath of these events. There were also a number of good ideas accepted by the Science Committee that are not in the base bill but which will be offered later as Floor amendments. I urge the Members to accept our Committee's unanimous judgment on these amendments, which include: The amendment of the gentlewoman from California creates a Homeland Security Institute. The Institute would be a non- profit organization assisting the Secretary in much the same way that the RAND Corporation and the MITRE Corporation assist the Secretary of Defense in analyzing proposals, establishing test-beds, assessing defense vulnerabilities and strengths, and so forth. The creation of this Institute was the major recommendation of last month's National Research Council report on terrorism R&amp;D. The amendment of the gentleman from New York creates an advisory committee for the Under Secretary for Science and Technology. The committee would review and make recommendations on general policy issues for the Under Secretary. Most importantly, the Committee will include representatives of the users of the Department's research activities--emergency responders--and of citizen groups. It includes proposed language by the gentlewoman from Michigan that strengthens the channels through which creative American inventors can propose their ideas and technologies to the appropriate government officials. Many of us have heard from constituents who fit that description and who have asked for our help. This amendment provides those inventors with a place to take their ideas. Two other amendments were adopted by the Science Committee but failed to make the list of amendments under consideration on the House Floor. I would hope that these items may be accommodated in the conference. First the amendment of the gentlewoman from Texas. to clarify how the Department should classify information. The amendment adds language requiring the Under Secretary, before issuing R&amp;D awards, to state definitively and in a timely manner whether the research results will be controlled by standard classification procedures. This policy was part of President Ronald Reagan's National Security Decision Directive 189, promulgated in 1985. And there is the amendment of the gentleman from Utah regarding standard setting by the Department. This amendment tasked the National Institute of Standards and Technology to work with the new Department in standard setting for chemical, biological, nuclear and radiological detection, and transportation standards. Mr. Chairman, I urge the adoption of these. We need to move this bill through the conference as quickly as possible.

This act contains many and much needed tax relief provisions for the American people. However, because of procedural rules in the Senate, this new law sunsets and expires after December 31, 2010. The legislation I introduce today makes permanent a tax provision in that law, that being the adoption tax credit. If we do not pass this extension, and the adoption tax credit sunsets, then this tax credit will be cut overnight from a maximum of $10,000 to $5,000. Families who adopt special needs children will no longer receive a flat $10,000 credit, and instead, they will be limited to a maximum of $6,000. As well, families claiming the credit may be pushed into the AMT, Alternative Minimum Tax. And the income caps will fall from $150,000 to $75,000 so that fewer families will be eligible for the credit. There are over 500,000 kids in publicly funded foster care right now waiting to be adopted. And there are even more in the private system. Let's help them find loving homes. Let's make it easier for families to adopt, not throw up barriers. If the adoption tax credit is cut to the prior law level of $5,000, many families will not be able to afford adoptions. And therefore less children will be welcomed into what they want the most, a real family. And adoptions are not cheap. Some licensed private adoption agencies charge fees ranging anywhere from $4,000 to $30,000.

Remember, these unions are not fighting against any increase in the President's authority to override collective bargaining agreements in the interest of national security. No, they actually want to roll back this authority that every President has had and has used since President Jimmy Carter. How do union special interests affect national security? Here are just a few examples: In 1987, a union objected to renovating border protection areas at Logan Airport--the same airport used by the 9-11 hijackers. In 1990, a union prevented the INS from adding extra immigration inspectors in the Hawaii airport because it might affect the overtime pay of existing workers. In 2000, a union objected to a Customs Service drug interdiction along the Florida coast because it would interfere with vacation days. Let me say that again. In 2000, a union objected to a Customs Service drug interdiction along the Florida coast simply because it would interfere with vacation days. So why are our colleagues on the other side advancing the labor union's agenda? Well, let's take a look at this chart. Four of the five major public sector unions who are publicly pushing for the Lieberman bill have showered over 93 percent of their campaign contributions to Democrats. The fifth contributed 87 percent. Here are the top contributors supporting the Lieberman bill: American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees contributed 99 percent of their funds to Democrats; American Federation of Teachers, 99 percent; International Association of Fire Fighters, 87 percent; American Federation of Government Employees, 93 percent; and National Treasury Employees Union, 94 percent. When it comes to the accusations of linking campaign contributions to political payoffs, my Democratic colleagues and their friends in the media continue to believe influence pedals down a one-way street. Remember the energy bill? You could hardly sit down to breakfast in the morning without reading about how Republicans were shamelessly catering to big oil and big energy interests at the expense of the environment. These accusations have blared forth from every corner of the media establishment. The New York Times--surprise, surprise--on several occasions editorialized about big money driving the energy bill, essentially viewing it as a payoff to oil companies and their friends in the administration, which include ``the biggest and dirtiest utilities.'' The Boston Globe judged a House-passed energy bill as ``little better than the one cobbled together by Enron, other utilities, and big oil for the Bush administration.'' The Fort Worth Star ominously warned of the ``propriety of allowing big contributors to shape public policy to their personal benefit.'' The Greensboro, North Carolina News and Register declared ``clearly something is wrong when big business shapes the nation's energy policy.'' This rhetoric also blared forth from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who charged this bill was ``crafted behind closed doors,'' and that it ``looked like the Exxon-Mobil report,'' and that Exxon- Mobil, Enron, and Chevron enjoyed an excess bonanza at the expense of consumers. Finally, the rhetoric blares out of our television sets every Wednesday night at 9 o'clock on the ``West Wing,'' a 60-minute political commercial masquerading as a television drama. On the premiere last week, the pretend president proclaimed, ``The Republicans are busy. They are trying to convince us that they care about new energy and that they are not in the vest pockets of big oil, and that is a tough sell.'' He then charged, ``This isn't the time for people whose doomsday scenario is a little less at the pump for Texaco and Shell. This isn't a time for people who say there aren't any energy alternatives just because they can't think of any. This is the time for American heroes, and we reach for the stars.'' Mr. President, this is a gift from NBC and GE to the Democratic Party, financed by millions of--you guessed it--corporate dollars. That is what the ``West Wing'' has been. I hope Senators don't dispute these corporations have a right to express political opinions. I do not believe political donations dictate public policy. In fact, I have been vigorously involved throughout my career defending the right of all these entities to contribute to the candidates of their choice and say, through issue advocacy, whatever they choose to say during the course of a year. But as long as people are going to make that charge, they ought to do it evenly. For those who do believe contributions impact policy, then let's, in the name of basic fairness, apply the same scrutiny to unions on the homeland security bill that the New York Times, NBC, and my Democratic colleagues applied to energy companies on the energy bill. If they did, here is what they would find. The biggest public sector unions--American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees; the American Federation of Teachers; International Association of Fire Fighters; the American Federation of Government Employees; and the National Treasury Employees Union--give almost 9 out of every 10 cents to Democratic candidates. Their agenda to weaken the President's national security powers is being advanced by the beneficiaries of those contributions. But we are hard-pressed to find anybody or any hotly accusatory stories in the New York Times or on CNN. Remember, Madam President, when corporate corruption called for a corporate accountability bill, unions--many of which were knee-deep in financial corruption themselves--rallied to block a very modest amendment to require better disclosure, simple disclosure on union financial reports. So where are the editorials in the New York Times? Where are they connecting the dots and condemning the specter of influence peddling? Where are the rants from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle against the influence-peddling of big union bosses? Where is that episode of the ``West Wing''--you know, the one where the pretend president tells Josh and Sam, above the obligatory orchestral crescendo, how much he yearns for ``American heroes'' to sever the menacing hold unions have on the homeland security bill? I could settle down in my favorite chair every Wednesday night at 9 p.m. waiting for that episode, but I am not a fool. My mother didn't raise any children as fools. I know that would be a wait in vain, for there are too many other Republican bogeymen to expose, too many conservative policies to mock with the elitist derision only Hollywood can muster, too many ways to stage easy political victories that real- life Democrats are simply unable to win in Congress because too many hard-working Americans do not believe in them. I call on my colleagues to put aside the pet grievances of the labor unions and return to the task at hand because I just don't see how any of us can go home and explain to the families in our States we may be giving the President less power to protect them than he had before September 11. So it continues to be my hope we will be able to get an up-or-down vote on the President's homeland security bill. It seems to me that is not asking too much. I know the Senator from Texas, and others, have spent an enormous amount of time to see to it the President's proposal at least gets an up-or-down vote in the Senate. I yield the floor.","word.count":1149,"sep11":-0.154494382022472,"years":2001.70505617978,"days":2387,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.430653579394467,"Topic 2":0.0355285329099125,"Topic 3":0.0136443929430395,"Topic 4":0.0255417806477963,"Topic 5":0.017592973684302,"Topic 6":0.0127925568510471,"Topic 7":0.00955156439207388,"Topic 8":0.32532430394343,"Topic 9":0.0192578735695616,"Topic 10":0.11011244166437},{"id":"10419960038404","body":"Frank R. Wolf: Mr. Speaker, I would like to insert and read a letter at the outset from Congressman Clinger and Congressman Davis. It says: ``Dear Frank, this is to respectfully request that H.R. 1855,'' which is the bill with regard to Dr. Morgan, ``be added to legislation now pending in the conference committee appointed to consider the appropriations bill for the Department of Transportation. As you know, H.R. 1855 was the subject of a hearing in the District of Columbia Subcommittee of the Government Reform and Oversight Committee on August 4, 1995. Subsequently, on February 1, 1996,'' and I will insert that letter in the Record, ``a written request was made to Majority Leader Richard K. Armey that the bill be discharged from the Committee. A copy of this letter is attached for your examination, along with a copy of the bill. ``Thank you for your consideration of this request.'' Signed ``Bill Clinger, Chairman, Committee on Government Reform and Oversight,'' and ``Tom Davis, Chairman, District of Columbia Subcommittee.'' Second, this Congress in the past had voted after Dr. Morgan was incarcerated in prison for over 2 years for not testifying in a case. Many people who are arrested in the District of Columbia for drug use and felonies get out faster than Dr. Morgan got out. And this Congress has been on record overwhelmingly on this case. Third, I would also say that I think, and I will submit the full statement in the Record, Members should know Dr. Morgan is extremely sick, she has had her rectum removed, she has a colostomy which is on a bag on her side. Her father died several months ago and she was not able to attend her father's funeral. Her mother is 80-some years old. Her mother is living with her in New Zealand, taking care of Dr. Morgan and also taking care of Dr. Morgan's young daughter. Dr. Morgan's young daughter desperately wants to return to the United States. This court has had the case for 9 years. Nine years. Last, Dr. Morgan is very sick, and I would ask any Member of this body who has either been sick or has a husband or a wife or a son or a daughter, whether or not they would not have wanted them to have the very best health treatment they possibly could, and I know from this body, made up of good and decent people, the answer would be ``yes.'' And Dr. Morgan would like to be able to return, so she could have first-class health treatment. On January 25 of this year, at a press conference, attended by the gentleman from Virginia, Tom Davis, and the gentlewoman from Maryland, Connie Morella, I promised that if the legislation I cosponsored allowing Ellen to return to America had not been signed into law at this time, I would include it in the fiscal year 1997 Department of Transportation appropriations bill. I said, and I quote: I did what I promised to do. The legislation passes no judgment on any of the parties involved. It does not take sides. It does not say anyone is right or anyone is wrong. I was not elected to Congress to harm people. I was elected to Congress to help people, and I have done what I believe is right. It is unconscionable to me that an American girl has been forced to live in exile away from her family and friends, where the courts have failed for 9 years to find a solution to this situation. Quite frankly, they have failed miserably. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support the rule. ``11-925. Rules regarding certain pending child custody cases.''. In August 1987, Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, a northern Virginia plastic surgeon, was jailed in Washington, DC, for contempt of court for failing to disclose the whereabouts of her daughter Ellen in a child custody case. Dr. Morgan was never charged with any crime yet languished in prison for over 2 years. Hardened criminals convicted of drug dealing and other crimes often spend less time in District of Columbia prisons. On September 23, 1989, President George Bush signed legislation I introduced prohibiting the District of Columbia courts from incarcerating anyone for more than 12 months in a child custody case unless they are charged with criminal contempt and given a jury trial to determine their innocence or guilt. Because of my legislation, Elizabeth Morgan was released. Dr. Morgan later joined Ellen who had been living in exile in New Zealand since 1987. On June 15, 1995, I cosponsored legislation, H.R. 1855, permitting Ellen and Dr. Morgan to return home. At that time, Ellen's grandparents were very ill as was her mother. Since that time Ellen's grandfather has passed away and her grandmother's health is rapidly deteriorating. In addition, her mother has undergone emergency colectomy surgery, was forced to live with a bag resulting from an ileostomy, and suffers from a severe intestinal ulceration. Dr. Morgan needs the medical attention she can only receive here at home and Ellen longs to return to America. Because of the failure of the court system in the District of Columbia, Ellen was prohibited from attending her grandfather's funeral this year. I promised that I would do everything in my power to make sure that she could still live the life of an American teenager that she so desperately yearns for. On January 25 this year, at a press conference attended by Representatives Tom Davis and Connie Morella, I promised that if the legislation I cosponsored allowing Ellen to return to America had not been signed into law by this time, I would include it in the fiscal year 1997 Department of Transportation appropriations bill. I said, ``I am here to tell you that it is my intention to search for an appropriate vehicle for this legislation and won't rest until it is passed. I will even attach this legislation to our fiscal year 1997 transportation appropriations bill as a last resort.'' That is what I have done and it should come as no surprise to anyone. Yesterday, the House and Senate conferees met to resolve the differences between the two Chambers' transportation spending bills and the agreed-upon conference report includes a provision changing District of Columbia law permitting Ellen, now age 13, and Elizabeth to come home. The legislation passes no judgment on any of the parties involved. It does not take sides. And it does not say anyone is right or anyone is wrong. I was not elected to Congress to harm people. I was elected to Congress to help people and I have done what I think is right. It is unconscionable to me that an American girl has been forced to live in exile away from family and friends while the courts have failed for 9 years to find a solution to this situation. And quite frankly, they have failed miserably. The legislation changes District of Columbia law, in this case only, by transferring visitation decisions from the court to Ellen and prohibits the court from enforcing any outstanding civil contempt order on Dr. Morgan resulting from this custody case. This is the right thing to do and it is the compassionate thing to do.","word.count":1202,"sep11":-5.10955056179775,"years":1996.75,"days":623,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.303500055679941,"Topic 2":0.0194294560122601,"Topic 3":0.00638433751568096,"Topic 4":0.551992435083286,"Topic 5":0.00306177023778098,"Topic 6":0.00365717642700298,"Topic 7":0.0726592808810839,"Topic 8":0.015482661364414,"Topic 9":0.0111184772027839,"Topic 10":0.0127143495957653},{"id":"11020070053356","body":"Doc Hastings: Mr. President, Senator Cornyn is a fabulous and important Senator.

Many people in the very beginning said it could not be done, and my colleague did it with perseverance. And I commend the gentleman from Iowa , chairman of the committee, and, of course, my good friend, the gentleman from Pennsylvania , because they also were strong supporters of this legislation. From the very beginning, Mr. Speaker, I always believed that a nation in the private sector and government at all levels must do all they can to encourage increased savings by the American people; and credit unions are a viable, dependable, and stable financial group that contribute so much to the economy, the health of our country and its people in making it easier for the American people to save and invest. And that is what keeps this economy chugging along. Credit unions are oriented to people rather than profits. We should always keep that in mind. The average credit union is small, just $23 million in assets, less than a tenth the size of the average bank. That is less than the single largest U.S. bank, all of the credit unions together, less than the single largest U.S. banking company. Mr. Speaker, this is a battle between rich bankers and working Americans. America's banking institutions are waging a war against credit unions, and let us not ever forget it, and let us not cover it up on this floor. These banks want credit unions out, including my good friends, the bankers in Glens Falls, New York. Both in court and in Congress, banks are trying to stamp out credit union competition and deny millions of American consumers access to affordable credit union financial services. This bill addresses the critically important question of credit union membership, which has already been outlined by the gentleman that spoke before me. Mr. Speaker, in my congressional district in upstate New York, there are 200,000 credit union members; and there are an average of 163,000 credit union members in every congressional district in America. Mr. Speaker, credit union members are so worried about this legislation because they are the owners themselves; and that is why they are there, to serve the people. I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.

This bill represents the tremendous efforts of literally hundreds of people in Arizona and here in Washington over a period of five years. Looking ahead, this bill could ultimately be nearly as important to Arizona's future as was the authorization of the Central Arizona Project, CAP, itself. Since Arizona began receiving CAP water from the Colorado River, litigation has divided water users over how the CAP water should be allocated and exactly how much Arizona was required to repay the Federal Government. This bill will, among other things, codify the settlement reached between the United States and the Central Arizona Water Conservation District over the State's repayment obligation for costs incurred by the United States in constructing the Central Arizona Project. It will also resolve, once and for all, the allocation of all remaining CAP water. This final allocation will provide the stability necessary for State water authorities to plan for Arizona's future water needs. In addition, approximately 200,000 acre-feet of CAP water will be made available to settle various Indian water claims in the State. The bill would also authorize the use of the Lower Colorado River Basin Development Fund, which is funded solely from revenues paid by Arizona entities, to construct irrigation works necessary for tribes with congressionally approved water settlements to use CAP water. Title II of this bill settles the water rights claims of the Gila River Indian Community. It allocates nearly 100,000 acre-feet of CAP water to the Community, and provides funds to subsidize the costs of delivering CAP water and to construct the facilities necessary to allow the Community to fully utilize the water allocated to it in this settlement. Title III provides for long-needed amendments to the 1982 Southern Arizona Water Settlement Act for the Tohono O'odham Nation, which has never been fully implemented. This bill will allow Arizona cities to plan for the future, knowing how much water they can count on. The Indian tribes will finally get ``wet'' water, as opposed to the paper rights to water they have now, and projects to use the water. In addition, mining companies, farmers, and irrigation delivery districts can continue to receive water without the fear that they will be stopped by Indian litigation. While some minor issues remain, we have every confidence that these issues will be resolved before a hearing is scheduled. In addition, before the next Congress begins its work we hope that negotiations with the San Carlos Apache Tribe, the only party not yet included in the settlement, will move forward so that all claims can be resolved by this bill. In summary, this bill is vital to the citizens of Arizona and will provide the certainty needed to move forward with water use decisions. Furthermore, the United States can avoid litigating water rights and damage claims and satisfy its trust responsibilities to the Tribes. The parties have worked many years to reach consensus rather than litigate, and I believe this bill represents the best opportunity to achieve a fair result for all the people of Arizona.","word.count":534,"sep11":1.06179775280899,"years":2002.92134831461,"days":2820,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0109229799973703,"Topic 2":0.0174607680984973,"Topic 3":0.00803808255764703,"Topic 4":0.074062245961032,"Topic 5":0.259832712069023,"Topic 6":0.374965676419938,"Topic 7":0.00364286621375376,"Topic 8":0.178637594291532,"Topic 9":0.0225790345889512,"Topic 10":0.0498580398022554},{"id":"10620000023634","body":"Jack Kingston: Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from New York for yielding me the time. Mr. Chairman, I wanted to speak in favor of the amendment, and I do so with the greatest respect, of course, to the committee upon which I serve. But if we look at the seniors who are having to go across the border to get prescription drugs and other people who need it, they are not doing this because it is convenient, they are not doing it because they want to, they are not doing it because they want to support a Canadian pharmacy. They are doing it because they have to economically. My dad is from Buffalo, New York, and I went to school in Michigan, and I know on those border States there is a lot of economic overlap and social overlap and everything else, and so for them to go to Canada to get cheaper drugs is not that unusual. But then imagine being 82 years old and getting a letter like this that says, however, future shipments of these or similar drugs may be refused admissions; that is very disturbing if we have to take something for high cholesterol or something for a heart condition. What am I doing? These people are World War II veterans. They do not want to go around breaking the law, and that is what the implication is from FDA once they get it. Mr. Chairman, look at these price differences. I think we cannot expect people who can save as much as 50 percent on a drug not to take advantage of it and to go overseas. But the second question about this is why are the drugs so less expensive in Canada than they are here, and I think that is where it becomes a universal quest for States that are not on the border. I mean, we need to know how come we can get Prozac for $18.50 and over here, it is $36. For Claritin, $44 versus $8.75. Prilosec, $109 versus $39.25. We owe it to our constituents. Even if they are in Iowa, in the middle of the country geographically, if we are in a central State, domestically, in the United States of America, we would still need to know and we need to be able to tell our constituents why these drug prices are so different. That is why I am supporting this amendment. I think, number one, we have to give people on the border States an opportunity; number two, we have to explore what are these differences, and this will help promote that debate.","word.count":435,"sep11":-1.20224719101124,"years":2000.65730337079,"days":2014,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0065680955867876,"Topic 2":0.0430183764364595,"Topic 3":0.00361795306617727,"Topic 4":0.00666476562953259,"Topic 5":0.00630750199394152,"Topic 6":0.00335027002320381,"Topic 7":0.01104212164688,"Topic 8":0.337892888728077,"Topic 9":0.213922317250946,"Topic 10":0.367615709637994},{"id":"10920050033206","body":"Marsha Blackburn: Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Georgia and the gentlewoman from Wisconsin each will control 20 minutes.

I want to repeat that question: How much government can working people afford? Today the combined Federal, State, and local taxes consume nearly 40 percent of the disposable income of working Americans. Federal taxes place the harshest burdens on taxpayers. In 1994, the average American family turned over 25 percent of its income to the Federal Government. That compared to just 2 percent in 1954. During the 1950's and the early 1960's, the Federal Government managed to pay for the national defense, build a nationwide Interstate Highway System, deliver our mail, and provide other vital government functions while living within its means. Today the Federal Government spends $500 million per day more than it collects in taxes and revenues. We are $4.9 trillion in debt. Interest on our national debt is the third largest single item in the Federal budget, topped only by Social Security and the national defense outlays. Federal entitlement programs are responsible in large part for our national financial predicament. Today working Americans are paying the bills to provide health care to the elderly, the poor, and the disabled. Today working Americans are paying the bills to fund numerous Federal welfare programs that create a lifestyle of government dependence. Today working Americans are paying the bills to subsidize various Federal programs for farmers, students, cities, counties, States, businesses, and the list goes on and on, which brings me back to the question I heard from my constituents: How much government can working people afford? We Americans are a fair and compassionate people. We believe in providing the benefits of Federal programs, such as Social Security and Medicare, for which people have paid for and earned. We also believe in helping those who want to help themselves. We are providing the programs that will help those citizens in our society who have encountered difficulties. But we must reform those programs that encourage government dependence as a way of life for millions of Americans. Mr. Speaker, working people pay the bills. They provide the funds to pay for all Federal programs and they must pay for the Federal debt an the interest that accrues because of irresponsible deficit spending. While Democrats criticize tax breaks for fat-cat corporations and businesses, who do they really think pays the corporate taxes? The working people of this country, Mr. Speaker. That is who pays corporate taxes. Corporate taxes are built into the cost of products and services purchased by consumers. When a consumer goes to the store and buys a product or purchases a service, he or she does not get two receipts for that product or service. They get one receipt for the item and within that one receipt are all the taxes that have been paid on that product. Instead, this consumer has only one receipt rather than two. No receipt for just the tax portion of the profits earned on the sale of that item. American workers pay the bills for all government programs and for all services. How much more government can they afford? Mr. Speaker, I urge President Clinton to join Congress in our effort to preserve Medicare, to change welfare, and to provide tax relief for working Americans and pass a 7-year balanced budget. This is the only way we can provide a Federal Government that working people can afford.","word.count":591,"sep11":-5.83707865168539,"years":1996.02247191011,"days":364,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0953584433795286,"Topic 2":0.0215561507147084,"Topic 3":0.0816012684976318,"Topic 4":0.762288909056619,"Topic 5":0.00828279935080555,"Topic 6":0.00399077123787756,"Topic 7":0.0042365948300553,"Topic 8":0.0130178355872473,"Topic 9":0.00455249267414576,"Topic 10":0.0051147346713805},{"id":"10419960009763","body":"Bill Archer: Mr. Speaker, I would like to be heard on the point of order on germaneness first and, subsequent to the ruling on that point of order, be heard on the second point of order on intergovernmental mandates.

The Lake Pontchartrain Basin is about 5,000 square miles. It encompasses 16 parishes in Southeast Louisiana, as well as four Mississippi counties. It is one of the largest estuaries in the United States, and at the center of this basin is 630 square miles of water, Lake Pontchartrain, that is surrounded by almost 1.5 million residents, making it the most populated area in the State of Louisiana. The problem with this area is that over the past 60 years wetlands loss, human activities, natural forces have had a lot of adverse impacts on the Pontchartrain Basin. Wetlands around the basin have been drained, dredged, filled and channeled for oil and gas development. Storm water discharges, inadequate waste water treatment, agricultural activities, they have all significantly degraded water quality. Loss of wetlands due to subsistence, salt water intrusion, and hurricanes also have harmed basin wildlife populations and placed 13 species, 13, on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Threatened or Endangered Species List. Today, swimming is still not allowed on the south shore of the lake due to the high levels of pollution. Because of all of this, last September I introduced one of my first pieces of legislation in the Congress, the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Restoration Act. This is designed to facilitate and accelerate the restoration, maintenance, and cleanup of truly one of America's most significant bodies of water. This act will create a coordinated technically-sound program for the restoration and sustainable health of the ecosystem. It will amend the clean water act to establish a program for water quality restoration activities in the basin. Most importantly, it will focus on voluntary, positive, proactive restoration projects, not an increase in government regulation, not bureaucratic finger-pointing. There will also be extensive input by all of the local stakeholders in Southeast Louisiana and the four Mississippi counties affected, including all government entities in the basin and universities and restoration groups. So it is a great productive, proactive model to use. Since introducing this act, I have held town hall meetings on the bill in Louisiana. I have met with hundreds of citizens and local elected officials to solicit their input. Their response has been overwhelming and enthusiastic and positive. These meetings were important because they affirmed the right model we are using for this legislation. Mr. Chairman, I do want to say, though, this legislation builds on a lot of local support and activity that has been going on for some years. There has been progress in cleaning up the lake and the basin, and I want to, in particular, highlight and salute the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation for its superb work in turning the corner and cleaning up the lake and bringing all parts of the community and all interested citizens and elected officials together. Their past efforts and outreach programs have informed many citizens in Southeast Louisiana about the steps we can all take to reduce pollution. Tremendous success has been achieved already. For instance, last summer I saw porpoises and manatees in Lake Pontchartrain, and that was something just a few years ago no one would have ever guessed and soon, many of the no swimming signs on the south shore will be taken up. Those signs first began to appear in Lake Pontchartrain in 1962 when I was one year old. Unfortunately, not all of the news is good news. On the north shore of the lake where there is tremendous development, some of those ``no swimming'' signs are soon to be erected, so there is still a long road ahead before we regain a sustainable, fully functioning ecosystem. For as long as I have lived, I have never known the lake as a place to swim, as I mentioned. Hopefully, my three daughters, Sophie, Lise, and Airey will not have to say that, will not have that same perception and memory when they are my age. Mr. Chairman, this legislation was reported unanimously from both the subcommittee and the committee with unanimous bipartisan support. I urge all of my House colleagues to vote in favor of it. I want to thank again the full committee chairman, the gentleman from Pennsylvania , the ranking member, the gentleman from Minnesota , our subcommittee chairman, the gentleman from New York , and the subcommittee ranking member, the gentleman from Pennsylvania , and all of the staff who have assisted on the bill, particularly Ben Brumbles and Susan Bodine of the Subcommittee on Water Resources.","word.count":783,"sep11":-1.39325842696629,"years":2000.46629213483,"days":1946,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.363095296358586,"Topic 2":0.48523681163062,"Topic 3":0.0549567001209875,"Topic 4":0.0270712640725837,"Topic 5":0.024861956656842,"Topic 6":0.00359805240214011,"Topic 7":0.0101959780630725,"Topic 8":0.00640621325547495,"Topic 9":0.00464833899952054,"Topic 10":0.0199293884401726},{"id":"10820030014246","body":"Ike Skelton: Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Washington , and urge a no vote on the rule.","word.count":489,"sep11":1.73314606741573,"years":2003.59269662921,"days":3059,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.15640806302928,"Topic 2":0.0400261754577646,"Topic 3":0.0052288950473359,"Topic 4":0.0133073131108697,"Topic 5":0.00813969867781177,"Topic 6":0.0343615580629214,"Topic 7":0.0537018007592731,"Topic 8":0.0134583224399298,"Topic 9":0.673457905120777,"Topic 10":0.00191026829403693},{"id":"11020070070947","body":"Sam Brownback: Mr. President, today, I introduce the National Cancer Act of 2007, along with my colleague Dianne Feinstein. Thirty-five years ago, President Richard Nixon signed the original National Cancer Act, and today, we are moving forward with a new, comprehensive bill that takes us one step closer to ending death and suffering from cancer within 10 years. This bill addresses impact-oriented issues such as the development of cancer prevention drugs and a screening for the most lethal cancer. Lung cancer is the number one cancer killer in America. Individuals afflicted with lung cancer historically have had only 15 percent survival rate. Our legislation includes a new demonstration program to continue research on a screening that uses a spiral CT scan. Screenings using this tool and appropriate follow-up procedures have shown very encouraging results in early detection. We also include accountability mechanisms in this bill. We request a report from the Federal Government regarding the manner in which Federal cancer research funding is being spent by requiring an estimate of the number of individuals who have benefited from such investment and the number of new treatments developed. Another issue our legislation addresses is the fact that less than 5 percent of adults diagnosed with cancer each year will be treated through enrollment in a clinical trial; this is often due to lack of awareness. Our bill creates an education program about the availability of clinical trials. Our legislation also includes efforts to ensure the availability of compassionate access options. Making decisions about treatment options for cancer is a decision best made between the cancer patient and their doctor. Compassionate access offers cancer patients, who have exhausted all of their treatment options, access to promising investigational treatments that have not yet received full approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Finally, our bill includes measures to accelerate the progress of the National Cancer Institute's initiative of mapping the genome of the most lethal cancers in America, which will lead to earlier cancer diagnosis and the use of personalized medicine. I look forward to working with my colleague Dianne Feinstein and others in moving forward with this legislation in the Senate. S. 1058.

I am pleased the Senate unanimously agreed to this important legislation and I am proud to have worked with both students and lenders and my colleagues on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, especially Chairman Kennedy and Ranking Member Gregg, as well as Majority Leader Daschle, in passing this monumental legislation. All across America, millions of young people are preparing to apply to college. These teenagers are dreaming not only of the college experience they are about to embark upon, but also of graduating to become teachers, doctors, engineers, and even public servants. Thanks to the national education loan program, the educational and career aspirations of students and their families can become reality. We know that the future of our Nation lies in educating the next generation of young people so that each of them can realize the promise of America. For 35 years, we have invested in our future by opening the doors of colleges and universities to the broadest cross-section of our citizens at the lowest possible cost. That is why passing this legislation was crucial to ensure that education loans are available to help future generations of students, workers, and their families climb the ladder of economic opportunity. Since 1965, a partnership of students, workers, their families, educational institutions, lenders, and the Federal Government has opened the doors of educational opportunity for more than 50 million Americans. By any measure, the education loan program is a winning investment for our Nation. Education loans are good investments in our economy and in our citizens. As I travel across South Dakota, educators, employers, and students tell me how valuable a college degree is in today's economy. Indeed, we know that graduates with college degrees earn an average of 80 percent more than individuals with only a high school diploma. Over a lifetime, the earnings difference between individuals with high school and college degrees can be more than $1 million. At a time when many workers are losing their jobs through no fault of their own, education loans are critical tools that can empower these workers to upgrade their skills. As we search for ways to expand our economic prosperity, we must preserve this important investment in the future of our Nation. Congress has now taken the initiative to ensure that future generations have access to the college or university of their choice by enacting a permanent solution to the interest rate issue. Again, I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their support in passing this critically important legislation of which we can all be proud.","word.count":463,"sep11":0.264044943820225,"years":2002.12359550562,"days":2536,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.00885718930982209,"Topic 2":0.296846628220127,"Topic 3":0.0357166216462668,"Topic 4":0.00498479359803322,"Topic 5":0.0152570180723059,"Topic 6":0.0039776137093596,"Topic 7":0.00435865656270056,"Topic 8":0.392357022779016,"Topic 9":0.203061048262141,"Topic 10":0.0345834078402279},{"id":"10720010033145","body":"Susan Davis: Mr. President, today Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America, a wonderful organization that exemplifies a spirit of volunteerism and commitment to others is celebrating their 90th anniversary. With more than 300,000 members nationwide, Hadassah is one of the largest women's and the largest Jewish membership organization in America. Hadassah was founded in 1912 by Henrietta Szold as a group of women ``interested in the promotion of Jewish institutions and enterprises in Palestine.'' What began as an attempt to provide health and social services to both Jews and Arabs in Palestine has grown into myriad undertakings. Today, Hadassah's major activities in Israel and in the United States span the arenas of health, education, social services, and environmental preservation. For instance, the Hadassah Medical Organization supplies quality medical care to individuals in the Middle East, regardless of race, religion, or nationality. The Youth Aliya Program provides housing and support for disadvantaged and immigrant youth in Israel. Additionally, the Jewish National Fund helps to build parks and preserve Israel's natural resources, while Young Judea helps U.S. teenagers build connections to Israel and Jewish life. In all of its endeavors, Hadassah has fulfilled its mission to promote a peaceful and prosperous Israel, ensure Jewish continuity, pursue social justice, and provide for the health, education, and well-being of individuals both in Israel and in America. Over its 90 years of existence, Hadassah has touched the lives of millions of individuals in a tangible manner. In a time when the Middle East remains embroiled in controversy and violence, it is comforting to find a group whose commitment has not changed over time. Even today, Hadassah provides lessons that we can all learn from. I am proud my home state of California boasts more than 25,000 members, people devoted to improving the world around them. As a lifetime member, I would like to thank Hadassah for its efforts, and look forward to celebrating future milestones with them.","word.count":102,"sep11":0.25561797752809,"years":2002.11516853933,"days":2533,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0207550712960819,"Topic 2":0.280976187422088,"Topic 3":0.0340958926072933,"Topic 4":0.013096798499094,"Topic 5":0.508743077078918,"Topic 6":0.00422762724323736,"Topic 7":0.00367977061709594,"Topic 8":0.0699778183692027,"Topic 9":0.0119620459088082,"Topic 10":0.0524857109581804},{"id":"10820030032321","body":"Peter Hoekstra: Pursuant to clause 12 of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until 2 p.m. today.

But even in its current form, I support the general thrust of the bill, as does the Secretary of the Interior, Bruce Babbitt, with whom we have been in contact this morning. H.R. 3605 is the product of lengthy negotiations between local officials in Utah and officials of the Department of the Interior, including, as I mentioned, Secretary Babbitt. These two sets of officials, representing local and national interests, agreed to wade into a protracted and politically thorny set of land use issues to put aside years of acrimony, to break a draining, pointless, ideological stalemate by working out practical, helpful compromises. And to just about everyone's amazement, they succeeded. I believe these local and Federal officials of both political parties deserve to be rewarded for their success, not snubbed. The negotiations that produced this bill should be a precedent for resolving land use disputes. That does not mean that every dispute will be resolved or that every resolution will merit congressional support. But thoughtful, carefully worked out resolutions like this one concerning the San Rafael Swell have earned our support. Does this bill successfully dispose of every issue the way I would most prefer? No, of course not. But this is a case where an old congressional saying is quite appropriate: ``Let's not make the perfect the enemy of the good.'' To those who believe that more land should be protected more fully than this bill allows, I say there is nothing in the bill that would block consideration of further land protection at a later date. But this bill will protect the bulk of the San Rafael Swell right now. To those who want greater restrictions on off-highway vehicles, I say the management plan or later laws can impose even further limitations. But this bill will codify significant restrictions on off-highway vehicle use right now. So we need to act right now to increase the protections for the San Rafael area. That is good for the environment. The amendments I have worked out will make the bill better for the environment by expanding the boundaries of the conservation area, clarifying the restrictions on off-highway vehicles and ensuring that land in the conservation area remains at least as protected as it is right now. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3605 as a bipartisan step forward in protecting our lands in the West for all Americans.","word.count":429,"sep11":-1.29494382022472,"years":2000.56460674157,"days":1981,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0717187941538759,"Topic 2":0.321995353007435,"Topic 3":0.0985386430746988,"Topic 4":0.00483516796796099,"Topic 5":0.418047320749405,"Topic 6":0.00518050016435643,"Topic 7":0.0036037176758027,"Topic 8":0.0546030824442774,"Topic 9":0.00378714982210906,"Topic 10":0.0176902709400788},{"id":"11020080022067","body":"Joe Barton: Well, Mr. Speaker, let me just simply say in closing that with regards to the last speaker's comment about the futures market, I tend to agree there may be something that we need to look at.

But on page 3 of this bill, there is a line that specifically excludes the futures market from the jurisdiction of the bill that's before us. We have a Federal price gouging bill on the floor right now that deals with retail and wholesale price gouging when there is absolutely no evidence of States' attorneys general conducting prosecutions of price gouging anywhere in this country. And as I pointed out in my opening statement, the average retail price for gasoline is up while retail margins are down, refineries margins are down. Retail prices are up because the wholesale price of crude oil is up over $130 a barrel. We're not doing anything in this bill to address that fundamental supply problem. We are a treasure house of energy resources here in the United States. We could produce more American energy for America's families and factories. You know, a price gouging bill when you don't have any real evidence of price gouging and where the States that think there's price gouging going on in their States have legislation to deal with that seems to me to be superfluous and symbolic.

And I appreciate all of those words by my colleague from Louisiana and certainly join her in all of those comments. Now, if I could briefly outline amendment 3728, which has not been called up, but I will outline what it does. Again, the Domenici amendment is crucially necessary for levy and hurricane protection work in south Louisiana. Amendment 3728 would simply supplement that in relatively small ways in terms of dollar amounts but in very important ways. At the outset, before I explain what it covers, let me explain three crucial overall points about the amendment. No. 1, all of the moneys or funds or expenditures in this amendment 3728 are completely offset so it does not increase the size or the cost of the bill whatsoever. No. 2, everything covered in the amendment was actually included in the underlying bill at the committee stage of the process. It has been removed as it comes to the floor, but it was included in committee and the chairman of the subcommittee, the Senator from New Mexico, has no objection to the inclusion of these important items. In addition, the statement of administration policy on the bill, while it highlights a number of items the administration actually opposes in the bill, does not highlight any of the items in this amendment. The administration has not expressed opposition to these items. And No. 3, all of the operation and maintenance required for these items in my amendment is funded 100 percent by the locals, by the local sponsors of these projects. Basically, it covers five crucial things. No. 1, addressing further damaged, destroyed or inferior protection levees in south Louisiana. While the Domenici amendment addresses many of those needs, all of these areas where there is a blue rectangle giving the new heights of the levee protection system, after the work in the Domenici amendment is completed, there are, unfortunately, a few gaps in this area of Lafourche, Terrebonne, and also the east bank of Plaquemines Parish. And this amendment would help fill those gaps. No. 2, fulfilling shortfalls in funding for full pumping capacity needs in Jefferson and Orleans Parishes with the closing of outfall canals. No. 3, meeting shortfalls to ensure equal levels of hurricane protection on the east and west banks of the Mississippi River in lower Plaquemines Parish, again, one of the slight gaps I pointed to on the map. No. 4, providing a plan to protect lower Plaquemines parish for the long-term and vital resources in that Parish--energy and seafood and maritime. And No. 5, the amendment would direct the national academies to perform a study to determine that portion of the levy system that lost height due to construction, design, subsidence, and settlement. In closing, Madam President, again, let me emphasize that everything in this amendment No. 3728 is offset, that everything in it was included by the committee during committee deliberations and is not opposed in the statement of administration policy and that everything in it, operation and maintenance related to these works, would be funded 100 percent by the local sponsors of these important works. I urge all of my colleagues, Republican and Democrat, to support my amendment. It does not increase the size of the bill, it merely perfects, if you will, the very important work being done by the Domenici amendment. With that, Madam President, I yield back my time.","word.count":210,"sep11":3.56179775280899,"years":2005.42134831461,"days":3710,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.328579247886844,"Topic 2":0.320342329070505,"Topic 3":0.111209951616419,"Topic 4":0.0105296907642532,"Topic 5":0.026322729273291,"Topic 6":0.0145108882173904,"Topic 7":0.00539626692426962,"Topic 8":0.16073881020499,"Topic 9":0.0145812163920051,"Topic 10":0.00778886965003345},{"id":"10920060011612","body":"Carolyn Maloney: Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5354, the Hurricane Relief Extension Act, and thank Mr. Boustany for introducing this very important measure. Mr. Speaker, in March of this year, Democrats from the House Committee on Education and the Workforce traveled to New Orleans and surrounding areas to survey and see firsthand the damage left by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The members of the delegation were clear in their assessment: Until you see the damage firsthand, it is very, very difficult to understand the magnitude of these storms and what the devastation that they left behind is. The school systems in the gulf coast were hit particularly hard. The wind tore off roofs of schools, and storm surges brought additional water into classrooms, sometimes reaching over 10 feet. These school systems, both public and private, lost books, computers and desks. Teachers, principals and students lost their homes to the storms. At the time of the delegation's visit, families had started to return to the area, and due to the leadership of local superintendents, principals and teachers, students were returning to the classrooms. Across the country, school systems in nearly every State opened their doors to enroll displaced students. They continued to educate these children, expending their own resources to meet the increased enrollments. In spite of the pressures on schools to reopen and enroll displaced students, it was not until December, nearly 5 months after the levees broke, that Congress designated funds to assist schools along the gulf coast and the schools that had taken in displaced students. And it appears Congress did not live up to its own promise. The funds provided were less than what was promised, nearly one-third less. H.R. 5354 does not fix the funding problem, nor does it address the challenges these same schools will have next year, particularly those in New Orleans, which expect their enrollment to double in the fall. H.R. 5354 will, however, resolve an immediate issue by extending the time in which funds are to be obligated for the current school year. H.R. 5354 also addresses a concern heard by the delegation during its visits to schools that State educational agencies were delaying the distribution of these funds to local school systems. As such, H.R. 5354 includes a sense of the Congress that urges States to expedite the release of these funds to local school districts. Families are eager to return to their communities, but will only do so if they can be assured that their children can attend school. H.R. 5354 will assist schools in their efforts to educate displaced students and reopen schools. Again, I want to thank the gentleman on the other side of the aisle, Mr. Boustany, for bringing this bill to the floor, and urge my colleagues to support it.

This commission is necessary because what we have discovered on the ground in Iraq has shown our intelligence to be wrong. It is necessary because Administration officials misused intelligence--that is, they made public statements and submitted reports to Congress that the Administration knew at the time to be unsupported by the available intelligence. And it is necessary because inaccurate and misused intelligence played a role in leading us to war. Accurate, objective, and credible intelligence is a fundamental cornerstone of our national security, particularly in an age of shadowy terrorist networks and clandestine weapons programs. Unless we improve our intelligence, we risk failing to identify serious threats to the United States and being distracted by lesser dangers at the expense of larger and more urgent security concerns. This effort must include not only the collection and analysis of intelligence, but the use, reporting, and dissemination of intelligence assessments. If the American people are asked to go to war to preempt an attack, or--as in the case of Iraq--to prevent a possible future threat from emerging, it is critical that the public statements of our officials be supported by the available intelligence. If members of Congress are to consider authorizing the use of force, particularly against countries that have not attacked the United States, they must be provided with honest and complete intelligence. And if our allies are to be asked to join us in confronting these threats, the intelligence that we share with them and that we rely on to bolster our case must be credible in the eyes of the world. I first proposed an independent commission to examine intelligence related to Iraq last summer, when it became clear that President Bush had made an important but unsubstantiated claim in his January 2002 State of the Union address. That claim was, quote: ``The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa.'' Although this statement has been dismissed as the ``16 words,'' its significant cannot be overstated. The State of the Union address is the most important, the most scrutinized speech the President delivers. The statement concerned the most important topic a President can discuss-- whether to send Americans to war. And this claim was the most important element of the President's argument for war: that there was evidence that Saddam Hussein might have the necessary materials to produce a nuclear bomb. As for the reference to the British government, it is hard to imagine how the use of the word ``learned'' could imply anything other than that the United States independently believed that the claim was true. It turns out that the Bush Administration had ample reason to know at the time that what the President was telling the nation could not be substantiated. The CIA had sought to dissuade the White House from making claims about uranium purchases. And on February 5, a week after the State of the Union address, Secretary of State Powell made a presentation to the Untied Nations in which he omitted the claim precisely because it was not supported by the available intelligence. Despite this knowledge, the Administration never issued a clarification. As a result, the President's statement stood, as an important element of the Administration's case for war. Only last summer, after Americans learned from Ambassador Joe Wilson and others what Administration officials knew at the time, did the Administration acknowledge that the uranium allegation should never have been included in the State of the Union Address. The case generated outrage across party lines. Republicans as well as Democrats expressed serious concern about the credibility of the Administration and the country. They stressed that cabinet members, the vice president, and the entire administration are responsible for honestly representing intelligence. They called for someone in the Administration to be held accountable. The Senate passed a resolution by voice vote. The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee promised to undertake a, quote ``very aggressive review.'' And the Bush Administration insisted that it would cooperate. As White House spokesman Ari Fleischer stated on June 11, quote: ``The Administration welcomes the review. It's important.'' In July, when I first sought to establish this commission, there was no dispute that the use of intelligence, as well as the collection and analysis of intelligence, should be examined. Republicans who voted against the commission did so, they said, because the commission would intrude on the jurisdiction of the Intelligence Committee. I was, and remain supportive of efforts by the committee to look into the use of intelligence related to Iraq, an inquiry that is clearly included within the committee's jurisdiction. But it was and is my belief that an independent, bipartisan commission, building on the findings of Congressional and other investigations, could undertake the most thorough, depoliticized review possible. Now, however, it seems an independent commission is the only remaining means left to examine the use, or misuse, of intelligence. On November 13, the Chairman of the Intelligence Committee announced that there would be no examination of how intelligence was used by policymakers. I deeply regret this decision by the chairman and fervently hope the committee will ultimately exercise its role, established in the resolution laying out its jurisdiction, in overseeing the, quote: ``use or dissemination'' of intelligence. In the meantime, I would expect that an independent commission would receive strong bipartisan support.","word.count":912,"sep11":2.25842696629213,"years":2004.11797752809,"days":3246,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.128637527730794,"Topic 2":0.0291455684970318,"Topic 3":0.0121043217591479,"Topic 4":0.00332493379839175,"Topic 5":0.0833994322739453,"Topic 6":0.0242454536958666,"Topic 7":0.00192441504901727,"Topic 8":0.539817682504033,"Topic 9":0.164425440803256,"Topic 10":0.0129752238885152},{"id":"10920060022941","body":"Ginny Brown-Waite: Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman very much for yielding this time.

If that proves to be true, that is a terribly, terribly serious thing that has happened.","word.count":141,"sep11":3.07022471910112,"years":2004.9297752809,"days":3535,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0988371400205295,"Topic 2":0.0580456110967125,"Topic 3":0.615700819637487,"Topic 4":0.0344303376777975,"Topic 5":0.00834024296216591,"Topic 6":0.0278180075317865,"Topic 7":0.0431528085572886,"Topic 8":0.0983703808176466,"Topic 9":0.0110663655868383,"Topic 10":0.0042382861117467},{"id":"10519980027671","body":"Speaker: NEUMANN.

On their way to their second Stanley Cup appearance in four seasons, the Hurricanes notched an impressive 55-22-8 regular season record, second best in the Eastern Conference. Carolina boasted the best home record in the league, experiencing record crowds at the RBC Center, the loudest house in the NHL. Four Carolina players recorded 30 goal seasons, led by emerging superstar Eric Staal, who finished seventh in the NHL with 100 points. As for the team's last line of defense, Martin Gerber set a franchise record for goaltender wins in a season. The team's depth was instrumental as well as their success was a testament to the character of its players and the ``whatever it takes'' mentality that permeated the locker room. Rookies and all-stars lined up side by side, playing key roles in the Hurricanes' run to respectability. Through the myriad of injuries, General Manager Jim Rutherford and Head Coach Peter Laviolette mixed and matched players as well as lines and pairings, shocking the Hockey Nation as Carolina stayed atop the Southeast Division standings. Knocking off the Montreal Canadiens, the New Jersey Devils, and Buffalo Sabres along the way, the Hurricanes returned home to beat the Edmonton Oilers with a score of 3- 1 and claimed the first NHL championship in their franchise history.

I yield to no man in my support for Israel. I have voted for hundreds of billions of dollars for it over the years I have served here. And I yield to no man my position to terror and terrorism and terrorists. But that is not what is at issue here tonight. The administration says this bill is not necessary. It points out that this bill constrains the administration in delivering meaningful diplomatic effort to resolve the problems of the Middle East. The Middle East's problems and the problems of the Palestinians and the Israelis will not be resolved by starving the Palestinians or by creating additional hardship. They are desperate people, incarcerated in walls, afflicted with high unemployment, suffering from health and other problems. The non-governmental organizations point out that this will strip them in substantial part of contributing to this. It will in large part almost totally strip the United States from the ability to address the needs of the Palestinian people and to address the humanitarian concerns which we have about them. Peace in the Middle East is not going to be achieved at gunpoint. It is going to be achieved by negotiations, by people working together; and that process may be ugly, dirty and slow, but it is the only process that will work. To create additional hardship and suffering for the Palestinians is simply going to guarantee more desperate, angry men who are fully determined that they will go forth to kill Israelis or Americans or anybody else. Our purpose here tonight should be to look to the well-being of the United States, craft a policy which is good for this country. And that policy can only be one which is good for Israel and for the Palestinian people, one which is fair to all, one which puts the United States as a friend and an honest broker of peace to both parties where we can be so accepted. To take some other course is simply to assure continuing hardship and a continuing poisonous, hateful relationship amongst the parties in the area. When this Congress realizes that and when we, this Congress and the others here, will recognize that that is the way peace is achieved, then there will be a real prospect for peace. We can expect that the Palestinians will receive the justice that they seek. We can expect that the Israelis will achieve the security that they need and they want and they deserve and that we want them to have. This legislation will do none of that. This legislation promises further angry men, more bitterness, more hate, more ill-will; and it assures that the thing which we must use to bring this miserable situation to an end, honest, honorable, face-to-face negotiation, will either not occur or will be moved many years into the future. Think about it. The needs of Israel are not served by this resolution. The needs of the United States are not served by this resolution. The needs of the Palestinian people are not served by this resolution. Let us vote it down and get something which makes sense and which serves the interests of all concerned. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the resolution on the floor. I oppose Hamas. I oppose what they stand for. I oppose their use of violence, their targeting of civilians; their vision for the Palestinian people; their rejection of Israel; and most of all I deplore their rejection of peaceful reconciliation. For all these reasons, and many more, I do not think that Hamas is a true partner for peace. But while Hamas may not be, the Palestinian people are. The vast majority of Palestinians want peace. The vast majority value peace, follow the law, oppose violence--and legislation like this only hurts the vast majority we need for peace. I understand the House's desire to ostracize Hamas. But I do not understand how we keep making the same mistakes by punishing the very people we all say we want to help. The restrictions on aid in this bill will not hurt Hamas, they will receive plenty of money from Iran, but this will hurt the Palestinian people. Under this bill assistance will be limited only to ``basic health'', a restriction we reject for almost every other nation. This bill would stop economic development assistance, sanitation assistance, environmental assistance--and most ironically, at a time when we are criticizing their choice of government--democracy assistance. Make no mistake about it; their vote was to get back at our own repeatedly misguided attempts to punish rather than cajole, to batter rather than build trust, and to impoverish rather than to uplift. When we provided Mahmoud Abbas no deliverables and only hardships, it made Hamas's promises hard to ignore. Our actions emboldened the Hamas, and we are about to do it again. My friends, passage of this legislation will create yet another failed state and humanitarian catastrophe in the Middle East. However, this one, unlike Iraq, will be surrounded by our staunchest ally in that region. If we destabilize Palestine we will destabilize Israel. If we help create chaos we weaken the chance for finding peace between Israel and her neighbors--and even threaten the very viability of the Jewish state. If this legislation is signed into law we will lose once and for all the Palestinian people. Our rejection of them will create one clear victor--the government of Iran. If we pass this legislation, Iran will win by default. Instead of textbooks for Palestinian children being written by USAID they will be written by the Iranian Revolutionary Council. Schools will be built with Iranian oil money and our ability to influence peace will be weaker as a result. What I find so strange is that this legislation is being championed by people who believe themselves to be the staunchest supporters of Israel. Mr. Speaker, in order to strengthen Israel peace needs to prevail in the region. In order to guarantee Israel's survival the Palestinians need to find prosperity and view the United States as a friend. This bill will only stymie those efforts. I ask my colleagues to vote no.","word.count":1060,"sep11":4.81460674157303,"years":2006.67415730337,"days":4156,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0407046698418637,"Topic 2":0.651099652522851,"Topic 3":0.0132389694764801,"Topic 4":0.0214107424015527,"Topic 5":0.0125156101621737,"Topic 6":0.0828158755997762,"Topic 7":0.00979045107618309,"Topic 8":0.0369089258796574,"Topic 9":0.124281593720607,"Topic 10":0.00723350931885569},{"id":"10519970018349","body":"Newt Gingrich: Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from Michigan for being so generous in yielding time to me. I was only going to make a short 1-minute statement, so now I will have to speak for the whole 5 minutes, I guess. Mr. Speaker, let me first confirm what the gentleman from Michigan has said earlier about the high degree of cooperation that we have enjoyed in the committee from the gentleman from Wisconsin , chairman of the full committee, and the gentlewoman from Maryland , chairman of the subcommittee. It has been a pleasure to work with both of these distinguished Members in connection with this bill. I will confess that I have not been particularly deeply involved in the drafting of this legislation but, of course, I fall back on the fact that 10 years ago I was deeply involved and that qualifies me to say anything I wish today. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3824 because I feel that it is the only practical short-term solution to the problem of revisiting the Fastener Quality Act. Our committee record on these revisions of the Fastener Quality Act was developed rapidly and is of necessity fairly narrow in scope. This effort was triggered, of course, by the announcement already referred to by the National Institute of Standards and Technology that the long-delayed regulations to implement the Fastener Quality Act would take effect on July 26, 1998, and the universal agreement that the law should be changed to exempt certain aircraft industry fasteners from the Act's coverage. Therefore, time was of the essence if the Congress was to intervene legislatively in advance of that date. The committee scheduled just one panel of witnesses which was largely drawn from the aerospace community, and with the exception of one witness from the National Institute of Standards and Technology, did not have the expertise to discuss the impact of the Fastener Quality Act beyond aircraft manufacture. The committee became aware that the auto industry, and perhaps other manufacturers, also faced potential adverse impacts from the scheduled July implementation of the Fastener Quality Act regulations. Mr. Speaker, the original Fastener Quality Act was based on extensive investigative, legislative and judicial records of defective fasteners, largely of overseas origin, which had turned up in tanks, submarines, aircraft carriers, planes of all types, bridges, and even nuclear power plants. Of course, as the gentleman from Minnesota mentioned, there was considerable public attention given to the quality of fasteners by such events as the Kansas City bridge failure. I have forgotten exactly what it was that caused that failure, but it at least focused attention on the problem of fasteners. The Committee on Energy and Commerce conducted an 18-month investigation during the 100th Congress, including five open and two closed hearings. It also involved numerous Federal Agencies and resulted in dozens of criminal prosecutions, civil actions and debarments. The situation cried out for legislative action. We face a much different situation in 1998 than we did in 1990. Eight years have passed since the Act was put in place without implementing regulations. The problems now seem much less daunting. During the 1990s, some industries had developed their own quality assurance systems which appeared to provide protections to the public comparable to those under the Fastener Quality Act, but at less cost. Even NIST, the agency charged with regulating fasteners, seems to have some second thoughts about the breadth of the Act, but no one had done a careful analysis either of the extent to which the Fastener Quality Act is still necessary and still serves its original purpose. The committee solution is the best possible under the circumstances. The delay will permit the Secretary of Commerce to study the extent to which the problems being addressed still exist, including the potential for defective fasteners from overseas once again penetrating the U.S. markets. It will also permit the Secretary to get an expert opinion on the degree of compatibility between the Fastener Quality Act and modern business practice and to make suggestions on how to update the Act. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this important legislation.","word.count":267,"sep11":-4.32022471910112,"years":1997.5393258427,"days":904,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0095909778999652,"Topic 2":0.350171268275555,"Topic 3":0.0102989278197259,"Topic 4":0.0196351870185604,"Topic 5":0.0260145576652382,"Topic 6":0.0297637042044932,"Topic 7":0.273910151930486,"Topic 8":0.0127817188154979,"Topic 9":0.21647445516875,"Topic 10":0.0513590512017279},{"id":"10720020020413","body":"Stephanie Jones: Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member, the chairman, and my colleagues who served on the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct.

However one is called into service, each Member must accept his or her responsibility and obligation to serve with honor and integrity, consistent with the tradition of this great House of Representatives which we love and revere. I seriously considered not speaking before the full House, in part because I believe that the misfortunes of one of my colleagues should not be used for political purpose or grandstanding. However, having accepted this responsibility of serving on the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, I believed it my duty and obligation to speak out in support of the decision that we made and in opposition to delay. Let me say at the outset that I have known the gentleman from Ohio for many years. As he stated many times in that hearing, he was a vocal supporter of my candidacy for the Ohio Supreme Court, and for that I will ever be thankful. Some even questioned my ability to serve, and I knew that I could be fair and so did the gentleman from Ohio . Let me go for a moment to this question about where the money was if the gentleman from Ohio got the money. If my colleagues got the money, would they put it in the bank? Let us talk a little bit about these jurors. I have tried many cases, both as a judge and as a prosecutor, and there were many times where jurors, once they rendered that decision, wanted to back up and say, I do not know if that was the right decision; judge, can tell us whether he was guilty or not or whatever it was. Jurors make decisions based on all the facts and evidence that is before them at that particular time, and this is what those jurors did. The burden was beyond a reasonable doubt, the highest burden of proof in our Nation. Our committee has a job and our committee is, and we are not governed by the same rules that my great colleague, Mr. Stokes, whom I have a lot of respect for, was when he made the motion back on Mr. Myers. Our rules of ethics are different. They are not the same as they were back when Mr. Myers was presented before this House. The rules say that this body can make a decision to expel a Member prior to sentencing and prior to conviction, and that is what this committee recommended to my colleagues. We are not a jury. We are not a criminal court. We are in the court of the House of Representatives and the court of public opinion which expects us to do our job, unlike the gentleman from Ohio , but my job is to make a decision right here on the House of Representatives.

Although I voted to pass this bill to demonstrate my support of strong border enforcement, it is yet another example of the House Republican leadership's piecemeal approach to immigration reform. America's immigration system is broken, but instead of implementing comprehensive, commonsense solutions such as increasing the number of border agents, funding more detention beds and enforcing current immigration law, House Republicans have chosen to manipulate this issue for partisan political purposes. In December of 2004 I voted in favor of H.R. 10, the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Implementation Act. This bill, which passed the House on a vote of 282-134 and which the President signed into law on December 17 of that year, authorized Customs and Border Patrol to hire 10,000 new border agents over the next 5 years as well as add 35,000 detention beds to hold illegal immigrants while they are being process for deportation. Although the bill passed overwhelmingly, House Republicans refused to back up this important legislation with the necessary funds to implement the provisions. The President, who signed the bill into law, only provided funds for 210 border agents in his fiscal year 2006 budget request. The United States cannot secure its borders with only physical barriers. We can only achieve effective immigration reform and border security through a combination of consistent enforcement of current immigration law, the addition of the thousands of additional border security personnel that Congress has already authorized, and the implementation of a fair, balanced immigration plan that encourages lawfulness, rewards hard work and safeguards families.","word.count":267,"sep11":5.1376404494382,"years":2006.99719101124,"days":4271,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.835796120631325,"Topic 2":0.0419506275615482,"Topic 3":0.057409258896508,"Topic 4":0.0114281504265735,"Topic 5":0.00558727552106367,"Topic 6":0.00488539850470786,"Topic 7":0.0318741928600322,"Topic 8":0.00517358207410597,"Topic 9":0.00451102089507768,"Topic 10":0.0013843726290577},{"id":"11020070028165","body":"John S.

Let me applaud the White House health task force and applaud it for several reasons. One, that task force raised to a national debate the question of the right kind of health care for Americans. If there is anything that we hear our constituents talk about, it is lack of access to health care and good health care. Just coming in from the Rayburn Room discussing with constituents who work with home health care agencies, the type of agencies that I have been familiar with or had familiarity with through the illness of my father, to come to find out that these agencies are being required to get $50,000 bonds, which they do not disagree with but they cannot get the bonds, and so people who are home-bound are not getting health care; that individuals who require home visits once a month to take blood tests are now cutting those services. These are the kinds of issues that we should be discussing: greater accessibility to patient care with respect to choice of physicians, making sure that individuals can be enrolled under these managed care programs, separating out the dollar from the care, making sure that the dollar is not the only thing that is considered when we have to take care of people in their times of illness. This is a silly, silly rule and we should really be applauding the fact that the White House health care task force under the leadership of Hillary Clinton allowed us to think about what kind of health services we want, what kind of health system, whether we wanted to have a system that was similar to the one in Canada, whether we wanted to have universal access, whether we wanted to have a combined. No, we did not resolve it, but we did discuss it, and we realize that there are problems with the system we have now. Those individuals who worked on this worked in good faith.

King is smiling. He is smiling, I say to the gentleman from Georgia , because the gentleman has come to this place, these hallowed halls and, as he C.B. King has watched the gentleman legislate, as he has watched the gentleman advocate, he is smiling to see that, in the tradition of a lawyer's lawyer, the gentleman has made his work to be not in vain. I thank you for your leadership. I thank you for honoring C.B. King, both in terms of a fixed memorial in Georgia and for this special hour. I had the pleasure of being one of the beneficiaries, as so many who are unnamed and who are not here, of the kind of legal activism of a C.B. King, so I could not miss this opportunity to cite him as one of the soldiers who complimented the activism of a John Lewis and a Martin King. I marched with the gentleman from Georgia in a re- commemoration of the Selma to Montgomery march. The marches I had were slightly different from those that were experienced by Martin King and John Lewis and Jose Williams and many others of the SCLC and SNCC. We engaged in the Black Student Movements in the institutions in the North throughout the 1960s and the 1970s. I think the specialness of why we salute C.B. King is because their work in the courts was universal to all of us who advocated through agitation. I think it motivated all of us who were given the opportunity to go on to college, and then choose a way of acting out this activism, to choose law school and, out of the opportunity, to see and admire those heroes in the courtrooms in the days when it was not as light as the times that we may have gone, who established the precedent upon which we could argue our cases. Mr. Speaker, I am reminded of my activism on death penalty cases, being able to use the old civil rights laws or the cases that many had already plowed ahead. This is a special time to honor C.B. King. He is not an unknown hero. He is part of that cadre of men and women we should be repeating time after time in our schools and in our celebration and commemoration of Black History Month. These were the mechanics, the intellectual mechanics, these who fixed things and put them back together again. They were fearless. They were articulate. They stayed up long hours. They were paid few dollars. Their hearts and their minds were strong. On this coming Sunday, April 16, it will be Census Day in Houston, Texas, Census Sunday, in fact. And I will spend my time encouraging our churches and those who gather in them the value of being counted, the value of acknowledging that you are somebody, the value of saying to the United States of America we need to be counted. We are claiming our birthright and claiming our rights and our responsibility as a citizen, and we will act upon it. Why is that relevant to C.B. King? It is relevant because C.B. King was part of the mechanics to translate what one person, one vote truly meant. He is part of the mechanics of allowing us to assemble peaceably, to partition against segregation, to allow us to vote freely and to speak upon who we want to represent us. C.B. King would be proud if we got ourselves counseled, for he is well aware that approaching in the year 2000, we will be looking ahead to see whether or not these seats, of which all of us hold from the South, all creatures of Thurgood Marshall and C.B. King and Julius Chambers and Horace Ward and so many others, all creatures of this whole concept of the Voting Rights Act and redrawing of the lines, to ensure there is one vote, one person. Would it not be a tragedy in 2001, similar to 1901, 100 years ago when Congressman White stood in this very place as he was drawn out of the United States Congress, the last African American Congress person to have come through the reconstruction and to stand here in these chambers, but he said to this very hollowed body, the Negro will rise like the phoenix. Although, this is my last opportunity to debate, my last opportunity to be representative, the Negro would rise like the phoenix. To C.B. King, I owe him much. I owe his mother and his father who trained him well. I owe the fact that he left Albany, Georgia, and went on to Case Western Reserve Law School, but he came back home. I owe the fact that I had the honor of working for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference as a young college student. I came to Albany, Georgia, to continue part of the Albany Movement that was still going on in the 1970s, to press for the right to vote and the right for individuals to choose their elected representatives. This evening as we honor these heroes, I would like to accept the challenge of the gentleman from North Carolina , the gentleman from Georgia , I would like us to chronicle the numbers of heroes who use the law in the courtroom as the gentleman from Georgia has done for us this evening, maybe we can collaborate and get all of these individuals who silently worked, starting with Thurgood, who we well know, but there are others who quietly worked in the 1940s, who we may not even have knowledge of them, to be able to say that they truly took the law, the tools that were given them, and did not use them selfishly or for personal self aggrandizement, but they used them to free a people. America is a better place because they worked to make us free. With that, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for giving me the courtesy of allowing me to salute a gentleman that I admired greatly and that I tried among others to emulate as I got the skills of a lawyer. I hope we will be able to honor them more and more. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to pay tribute to Chevene B. King an outstanding man and distinguished attorney. As a participant in the Earl Warren NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund training program, I am honored to inform the American people of a man who championed civil rights and carried the movement into the political arena. Chevene Bowers King was born on October 12, 1923, in Albany, Georgia, the third of eight children of Clennon W. King, the owner of an apparel shop and supermarket and Mrs. Margaret Slater King. Mr. King attended Mercer Street Elementary School and Madison Street High School in Albany. After graduation he attended Tuskegee University for a year and then decided to enlist in the United States Navy. After three years of service, Mr. King left the Navy and enrolled at Fisk University where he earned his bachelors degree in Political Science. Pursuing his political education, Mr. King attended Case Western Reserve University, School of Law in Cleveland, Ohio. After law school he became a pre-eminent civil rights attorney in southwest Georgia, working with other African American lawyers from Atlanta, Macon, and Savannah. He worked closely with the local chapter of the NAACP, and was a cooperating attorney with the NAACP legal Defense and Educational Fund. His accomplishments and work spanned the entire range of civil rights from school desegregation to the Voting Rights Act. He represented African American voters and candidates for office in the struggle against at the time unconstitutional segregation and discrimination. He led the way in making the basic right to serve on juries a reality in rural Georgia by bringing a series of lawsuits that exposed the discriminatory practices that had continued for more than 100 years after the U.S. Supreme Court first held that discrimination in the selection of jurors violated the Fourteenth Amendment. When the civil rights struggle secured the ability to work in America free from discrimination, Mr. King fought to ensure that this right was enforced. Mr. King brought a number of actions to enforce the provisions of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and to provide equal job opportunities for African American workers. Mr. King was known as a great scholar of jurisprudence and a superb orator. His regal demeanor in the courtroom brought a thoughtful and tranquil specter to the meaning of the civil rights movement. In the tradition of men like Charles Houston, Thurgood Marshall, and William H. Hastie he approached the practice of the law with activism and a commitment to excellence in legal scholarship. Because of his reputation he was counsel to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Elijah Muhammad and the Albany Civil Rights Movement of the early 1960's. In 1960, Mr. King ran for President of the United States and for governor of Georgia in both cases as a write in candidate. In 1964, with utter determination he ran for the congressional seat of the 2nd District of Georgia. For his courage and commitment to civil rights he received the N.C.B.L. Lawyer of the year Award in 1975, A.T. Walden Library Award in 1977, and the L.S.C.R.R.C. Pro Bono Public Award of the State of Georgia. On March 15, 1988, Mr. King passed away at the age of 64 survived by his wife, Carol Roumain, and his four sons, Chevene B. Jr., Leland, Clennon, and his daughter Peggy. In closing, I am reminded of the great quote by President Theodore Roosevelt, Chevene Bowers King the American people will always remember your contributions and we shall always remain in your debt.","word.count":338,"sep11":-2.4747191011236,"years":1999.38483146067,"days":1561,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0562847849549202,"Topic 2":0.352886389626582,"Topic 3":0.228625143144282,"Topic 4":0.00640309922114709,"Topic 5":0.286696412383247,"Topic 6":0.00768894952891515,"Topic 7":0.00332894944313469,"Topic 8":0.0394024920264923,"Topic 9":0.00690375402956617,"Topic 10":0.0117800256417125},{"id":"10620000031061","body":"Jim Kolbe: Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding me this time. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased this afternoon to rise to talk about that part of this conference report that covers the 2001 Treasury Postal Service and General Government appropriations bill. This is a bill that is strong on law enforcement. It is tough on guns and it supports a policy of zero tolerance on drugs. Now, the President has said that he will sign all reasonable appropriation bills this Republican Congress sends to him. Mr. Speaker, this is exactly what he asked for. It is reasonable in every sense of the word, as I will attempt to describe here. Our part of this conference report is fiscally responsible and it is completely free of any and all controversial legislative riders. Let me just take a moment to describe a little bit of the nuts and bolts of the measure. First of all, overall it has $15.6 billion in support of the agencies that are covered by our appropriations subcommittee. It is $1.9 billion, or 13.8 percent above the 2000 enacted level. It is 5.4 percent or $900 million below the President's request but it is also $1.228 billion above what we first initially passed in the House. Some of the increases over the 2000 enacted levels include these: $449 million for U.S. Customs Service, including not less than $258 million for the badly needed Customs automation program, particularly the new one called ACE or Automated Customs Environment; $204.9 million for the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms; $423 million for IRS to support ongoing efforts for organizational modernization; $15.2 million for the HIDTA, the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area program, a total of $206.5 million for that; a $10 million increase for the Drug Free Communities Act; $142 million for the Secret Service to support their ongoing protective operations as well as the work that they do with school violence; a total of $276 million as an advance appropriation for fiscal year 2002 for four new courthouses for a total of $472 million in fiscal year 2001 for four new courthouse projects, two new border stations, the continuation of FDA consolidation and the construction of ATF headquarters. Lastly, let me just mention that there is $88 million to begin the work and restoration of the National Archives headquarters and protection of our charters of freedom. In terms of legislative items as compared to the House-passed bill, this agreement does not include any provisions related to the Cuban sanctions. It does not include provisions related to the prohibition on the use of funds to implement regulations clarifying what constitutes a satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics for Federal contractors, also known as the black listing provision. It does not include the provision prohibiting the use of funds to provide preferential treatment for the acquisition of firearms or ammunition. It does not include any provisions relating to reforms of the Federal Elections Commission, including the provision on the use of government aircraft by House and Senate candidates. Conversely, this agreement does include current law from both the prohibition and use of funds for abortion as well as a requirement that health benefit plans provide contraceptive coverage. It does include a 1-year extension of the pilot project for child care and it does include current law as enacted in 1999 for the Kyoto protocol. Mr. Speaker, I know that some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are going to cry foul about this bill. They are going to claim the conference agreement was put together in the dead of night without their participation. Well, we did work long hours and indeed some of those hours were in the middle of the night in order to put together this responsible bill, but the truth is, and my colleagues know this, that they were invited to participate at every step of the way. For every meeting that was scheduled with the Senate, they and their staffs were invited to attend. The fact is, they declined to participate. They declined our invitation to participate. Now, I also suspect my colleagues will claim, as they already have, this bill is headed for a veto because it fails to fund must-have items requested in the President's budget. The fact is, we do not know if the President will veto this measure. Through the grapevine we have heard several variations of the position of the White House. First, they thought this was a reasonable bill, albeit somewhat short when it came to funding new employees in the IRS. We were led to believe the administration wanted to add back or add an additional $100 million. Then we heard the White House wanted $300 million, some for IRS, some for Archives, some for Treasury law enforcement. Finally, we heard the White House does not really have a specific list of must-have programs they believe are underfunded but rather there is a general list of must-have items that now totals between $729 million and $783 million, more than half of which would go to courthouse construction. Regardless of courthouses, this conference agreement funds 8 projects, one more than the President requested. Now, some will say that we are playing games with the numbers because we forward funded four projects. The fact is of those four projects, one of them, the largest one, in Miami at $122 million, has a lot of controversy about it and it has a difficult time in the authorization process. It made sense to actually forward fund this one. Let us be honest about who is playing games and using gimmicks. It is not the Committee on Appropriations. There is one fact and one fact only that has kept us from passing this bill sooner. The White House will not give us a position on the bill. They will not specify what items which might cause them to veto this measure. They will not sit down and negotiate with us. In all my years on appropriations, I have not seen a time when the White House outright refused to give a position on the bill, but this is apparently the year where they simply refuse to come to the table and negotiate in good faith on this appropriation bill. I urge my colleagues to support this conference report so we can get on with the business of Congress.","word.count":1070,"sep11":-1.01685393258427,"years":2000.84269662921,"days":2080,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0153411192180369,"Topic 2":0.528252599566457,"Topic 3":0.0221021682237308,"Topic 4":0.00878225602337355,"Topic 5":0.0401869516375708,"Topic 6":0.0242710765538212,"Topic 7":0.191385098308115,"Topic 8":0.0165188341245882,"Topic 9":0.054869418734749,"Topic 10":0.098290477609557},{"id":"10720010057972","body":"Debbie Stabenow: Under the previous order, the Senate will now resume consideration of H.R. 5093, which the clerk will report by title.

Since August, the intense national debate that has developed in Congress, in the American public, and internationally about whether the United States should use military force if necessary against the regime of Saddam Hussein, and to use such force preemptively, has served a very salutary, even necessary, purpose. Both as a former Army counterintelligence officer and a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, this Member hates security leaks. The massive leaking about sharp internal disagreements within the executive branch, especially the Pentagon, unfortunately preceded the necessary international diplomacy, essential consultation with at least key committees in Congress, and any concerted effort to inform the American public as to why military action may be required now and why an Iraqi regime change may be necessary. It also seems clear that the discussions of U.S. military action to eliminate Saddam's weapons of mass destruction, WMD, stocks and efforts for a regime change in Iraq had gotten ahead of the planning and decisionmaking for such possible action. Many of this Member's colleagues, in both Houses of Congress on a bipartisan basis, and this Member, along with a sufficient number of voices from the American public, helped make it clear to the Bush administration that a congressional resolution authorizing the use of force was an essential step before any preemptive military action against Iraq could be launched. Despite an earlier White House counsel's advisory opinion that a congressional resolution was not required, in a September 4 meeting with elected congressional leaders, President Bush advisedly agreed that his administration would first seek such a resolution. Thus, the House is here today embarked on this gravely important duty. Another very positive result of the leaking and the resultant intense controversy over the issue of military action on Iraq is what likely will be the outcome of the international community's furor about a potential unilateral and preemptive American strike against Iraq. That strenuous opposition is especially the case among our traditional European allies and the Arab states. As was the case in the Gulf War, the administration sought international support for actions on Iraq through the United Nations as a result of President Bush's exceptional speech to the U.N. General Assembly. Finally the international community has become serious about demanding the reintroduction of U.N. weapons inspectors in Iraq with the unfettered access demanded to search out and destroy production in storage sites of chemical, biological, and possible nuclear weapons. The U.S. is right to insist upon an unconditional time-certain demand for any new inspection regime to begin and to insist upon full compliance with unfettered access for U.N. inspectors. The international community now has this forceful proposition before it: Either an effective U.N. weapons inspection program resumes and continues in Iraq now or the U.S. has established more forcefully the legitimacy of military action for regime change with the reasonable expectation of a supportive international coalition for military action against Iraq and for the perhaps more difficult task of Iraq reformation in its aftermath. Because of an intense public debate on the necessity of military action against Iraq and especially the involvement of Congress, the resolution the House has before it today has evolved into a far more acceptable one and the legislative process has not yet been completed. The broad language extending the authorization for the military force to ``secure peace and stability in the Middle East'' has been narrowed to Iraq. The War Powers Act's requirements with reporting requirements to Congress are now included in the resolution. A limited notification to Congress by the President about the intent to use or the use of the authorization for military force is now included in the measure. And importantly now included in the resolution is the requirement to report to Congress under Section 7 of Public Law No. 105-338 about the U.S. planning and actions to be conducted or undertaken by America in Iraq after the Saddam Hussein regime is removed from power. In other words, according to that Act and that report, humanitarian assistance, democracy transition assistance, and methodology for Iraq to repay its debts are all elements explicitly required. Before using military force, the President now under the procedures specified in H.J. Res. 114 must make available to Congress his determination about two things: that ``reliance on further diplomatic or other peaceful means alone either will not adequately protect the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq and is not likely to lead to enforcement of all relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq,'' and that military action is consistent with the U.S. and international war against terrorism. These are among the important changes to a proposed congressional resolution that evolved to the one before us today. Now, what is the case against Saddam Hussein? Especially important, what is it that justifies the preemptive use of military force? This Member's colleagues will recall, of course, that without provocation, Saddam attacked and occupied Kuwait with an attempt to annex it. Crucially, however, as the House considers preemptive force, it must be recognized that Saddam has used weapons of mass destruction, specifically chemical weapons, against Iran and against the Kurdish population of his own country. Is there any legitimate doubt that he would be willing to use them again? Unfortunately, I have no such doubts that he would indeed use weapons of mass destruction again. There also is no legitimate reason to doubt that he has a significant stock of both chemical and biological weapons. The U.S. recovered unused SCUD warheads with traces of both such types of chemical and biological agents in 1991, and in this forum this Member can only say that Saddam Hussein has now developed further ways to deploy such chemical and biological agents against his enemies. The evidence is clear too, obtained from numerous verifiable sources, that Saddam attempts to develop nuclear weapons, that he did so in the past and today again. Ongoing attempts by Saddam to acquire dual-use technology for use in a nuclear development program continue, and that is notwithstanding the controversy about the intended use of one such attempted acquisition. Should anyone have any doubts that Saddam has and is attempting to procure plutonium to substantially shorten the time of developing nuclear weapons, I have no such doubts. Thus, WMD remains a great threat to a widening circling of Saddam's neighbors and our own forces and facilities in the area. However, again, what is also crucial and urgent is whether after the terror strikes of 9-11, we have any doubt that he would provide such WMD chemical, biological, and perhaps nuclear, in the future to terrorist groups who would use them against our citizens and those of our allies. This Member does not doubt in the slightest, and it is a risk that the U.S. cannot accept. In saying this, this Member does understand that the administration cannot yet present incontrovertible evidence of a link between al Qaeda and Saddam. There are, of course, reasons for strong suspicions about such links. That logically brings the House to the question of why at this time Congress should authorize the future potential use of military action by the administration. This Member believes it is clear that the threat Saddam poses will only intensify. The U.S., the Western democracies, and Iraq's neighbors should never have permitted Saddam to hamper and then bar the reentry of U.N. weapons inspectors. In the 11 years since the end of the Gulf War, and certainly in the 4-year absence of such inspections, Americans are now in more danger because of that collective lack of resolve to enforce WMD disarmament and because of the commercial and foreign policy goals of some of America's European allies and Russia. Now, of course, in a post-September 11 world, the U.S. knows all too well that mass terrorism has been waged against civilians, in this country and abroad. It is a terrible part of the equation that the American President and the Congress now must responsibly consider. Does the U.S. now have a reasonable basis to conclude that Saddam is not an imminent threat against the United States? Is there a clear justification for attempting to override the conclusions of the Commander in Chief? The answers are, unfortunately, no. Delaying action is a greater risk to America's national interest, the security of our citizens, than the uncertainties that always attend a war and its aftermath. The resolution authorizing the use of force, or one that we might craft by amendment, is an authorization this Congress should approve. As the House takes this extraordinarily important step, fully mindful that Congress in passing the resolution authorizes putting members of the U.S. Armed Services in harm's way, and recognizing no citizen in this country is assuredly safe now from related terrorist events either, Congress has additional important responsibilities. Congress needs to take every step to assure that the executive branch has given adequate consideration and provided contingency planning and resources on the following questions, which, bear in mind, are beyond the questions about adequately helping and preparing and deploying our military force. These questions are: number one, has the U.S. taken adequate steps to broaden the international coalition for not only the military operations, but especially for the more important and long-term task of developin","word.count":1982,"sep11":1.10112359550562,"years":2002.9606741573,"days":2834,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.148443293942512,"Topic 2":0.0484650896655849,"Topic 3":0.0615424146767395,"Topic 4":0.00645535732548923,"Topic 5":0.178919795499148,"Topic 6":0.4051143256974,"Topic 7":0.0161198230473822,"Topic 8":0.0821641945632559,"Topic 9":0.00780686120008247,"Topic 10":0.0449688443824053},{"id":"10720010020627","body":"Chris Cannon: Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words, and I rise in opposition to the Roemer amendment. Mr. Chairman, I think I know the direction of the debate here, but I think it is important that we not deceive ourselves. All of the impassioned comments that I have heard here in the last few minutes are for a commission that would not be created by the Roemer amendment. The Roemer amendment is a very narrow shadow of the commission that the gentlewoman from California described, a broad-based commission. And I would say, to the gentleman's credit, he understands this, because he had to craft something that would be germane to this legislation. This legislation, if we take a look at the four points that are covered here, focuses exclusively on the intelligence community. The first element is to make sure that the inquiry, the joint inquiry under way is implemented. Well, that can take place only after we have seen it; but I will tell my colleagues one thing, a joint committee, or a joint inquiry by the two intelligence committees' recommendations to itself cannot be ignored by the two intelligence committees. Now, what happened on 9-11 was certainly representative of deficiencies in the intelligence community, no doubt about that; and there may be some failures. But the biggest deficiencies, the biggest failures were in the law enforcement community, I say to my colleagues, and the relationship of the law enforcement community to the domestic agencies. In the particular terrorist event that ravished this country on that day, both here across the river and in New York City, of course, it was the failure, the link between the FAA and the commercial airlines and the law enforcement agencies, at least the Federal law enforcement agencies. That was the failure. The gentleman from New Jersey, just a few minutes ago, said some things that he would like to see it broadened. Well, if we are going to have a commission here, and I am not opposed to it, it is going to have to look at the whole array of problems that we had. We cannot simply look at the intelligence community. We have to look at where the response to information would be acted upon. If we take a look at all of the agencies, a part of which are being merged under the proposed homeland security agency or department, those are all of the elements of domestic response and law enforcement that have to be there to do something with the intelligence we hope we have. We were surprised. We had deficiencies in intelligence. I say to my colleagues, it is not going to give us the Commission that everybody here is talking about. It is not going to give us that comprehensive examination. I say it is a cruel hoax to suggest to the families of the victims of what happened across the river and in New York City that such a commission is going to give us those answers. It is too narrowly focused. It had to be, to be offered by way of this amendment. So we may vote for it, but let us not kid each other. This is not going to do it, I say to my colleagues. It is a part of it; it is not the significant part, in my judgment. The biggest failures that took place on 9-11 were in the law enforcement and domestic agency fronts.","word.count":306,"sep11":-0.115168539325843,"years":2001.74438202247,"days":2401,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.530133980033126,"Topic 2":0.0380336469404316,"Topic 3":0.0143655797608987,"Topic 4":0.0220304120587107,"Topic 5":0.00803192668766867,"Topic 6":0.0516101509575524,"Topic 7":0.0158599486115692,"Topic 8":0.118053558462074,"Topic 9":0.193799000268544,"Topic 10":0.00808179621942446},{"id":"10419950051993","body":"Glenn Poshard: Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.","word.count":189,"sep11":-6.1123595505618,"years":1995.74719101124,"days":266,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0288602706334333,"Topic 2":0.0671889784340724,"Topic 3":0.00802434265332187,"Topic 4":0.00967591473826755,"Topic 5":0.0163570845016706,"Topic 6":0.00690427766084913,"Topic 7":0.140315882815331,"Topic 8":0.409774659130991,"Topic 9":0.0539453280740257,"Topic 10":0.258953261358037},{"id":"10820040051532","body":"Edward Kennedy: Mr. President, I rise today in support of this amendment because it will give States the flexibility they need to reduce special education paperwork. We have heard from many teachers that they must take too much time out of their busy days to complete IDEA paperwork requirements. Teachers would rather spend that time in the classroom teaching their students. We have heard these concerns loud and clear, and we have responded with changes to make things easier for both parents and teachers. This bill reduces paperwork and meetings by: Streamlining educational planning and procedural requirements; simplifying the Federal application process; encouraging the use of technology; clarifying that no paperwork is required beyond what is in the Federal law; and requiring the Department of Education to develop model forms. These changes will go a long way to simplifying the work of special education teachers and giving them more time to do what they do best-- teach children. These changes will also make it possible for more parents to participate in their child's education. This amendment will give a limited number of States the opportunity to do even more to address paperwork by giving them flexibility to waive paperwork requirements. But today the Senate needs to make it absolutely clear that this flexibility does not include waiving Civil Rights protections for disabled students. Civil Rights are the very heart of the IDEA. The right to go to a public school, the right to learn alongside one's peers, the right to an appropriate education, and the right to due process, are fundamental to this law and we cannot allow waivers to trade these rights in exchange for less paperwork. In July 2002, President Bush's Commission on Excellence in Special Education gave Congress and the President its recommendations for improving results for disabled students. This commission offered many suggestions for reducing paperwork in special education and allowing these waivers was one of them. But the chair of the President's commission was absolutely clear that paperwork reduction should not threaten civil rights. Listen to what the chair, Governor Terry Branstad of Iowa, had to say when he testified before the House on the IDEA and the commission's report: We must ensure that States live up to the full intent of the commission's recommendation--to balance paperwork reduction with civil rights protections. The chair of the President's commission is not alone in his concern for protecting civil rights while reducing paperwork. The National Council on Disability--the Federal agency responsible for advising President and Congress on issues affecting the disabled--says that, if not done carefully, waivers may have unintended consequences. According to the National Council on Disability: Let me first speak to the issue of paperwork and educational quality. Ask any teacher how he or she begins the day before the students arrive. They begin by reviewing a lesson plan that sets the goals for the day and describes how those goals will be reached. They develop tests for their students to see if they are meeting those goals. These lesson plans, goals, and tests are based on a thoughtful and comprehensive curriculum. This is all paperwork--paperwork that is necessary to ensure quality instruction for every student. Quality instruction for disabled students is no different. Special education paperwork ensures that schools think carefully about how best to educate a disabled student, then document their plan, and then document progress. Does any of that paperwork sound unnecessary? If States interpret these waivers as a license to set aside these important pieces of a disabled child's education, we have completely undermined the focus on academic and functional achievement in this bill. Just like the National Council on Disability, I also have expressed my great concern about protecting civil rights if States are given too much flexibility. In my opening statement, I addressed the issue of noncompliance with this law. All across this country, nearly 30 years after this law was first passed, many disabled children still are denied their right to a public education. Year after year, the majority of States fail to implement the IDEA and are found out of compliance with its most basic requirements. Reports from the Department of Education show just how rampant noncompliance with the IDEA is. From 2000 to 2003: 76 percent of States did not appropriately resolve complaints; 71 percent of States lacked effective systems to monitor and enforce the law; 71 percent of States did not educated disabled children with their peers; and 65 percent of States did not appropriately prepare students for post-school employment and independent living. These States already blatantly disregard the requirements of the IDEA. Imagine what would happen if these States are given waivers without the clear limitations set forth in this amendment, if they could feel free to waive any requirement in the name of paperwork reduction. The impact of unlimited paperwork waivers on disabled students in States like these could be devastating. Even with detailed requirements for education plans and other paperwork under current law, look at what is happening to disabled children all across the nation. The Richer family from Oregon writes that their school made the decision to shorten their son's school day by 3 hours--without asking the parents first. The same school district completed their son's education plan and assigned him to a classroom without including his parents in the decision. The Johnson family from new Jersey writes that it took 18 months to get an appropriate educational plan written for their child, and the school still will not provide the speech therapy and counseling services written on that plan. These are true stories, just like the hundreds of other true stories that parents have sent to me. This is why it must be made absolutely clear that these waivers are not a free pass out of accountability or a way to erode individualized education plans that are the cornerstone of the IDEA. Look at any other field--the legal field, the medical field, or business. In these fields, if it wasn't documented, it wasn't done. Insurers don't pay doctors when they don't document the care they provided. Clients don't pay lawyers if they do not document the hours spent on a case. And businesses don't provide their services without a contract. In every part of life, documentation is the way we guarantee that people did what they promised to do. It is not too much to ask that schools do the same so we can be sure they are complying with the law and giving every disabled child an appropriate education. I know that we demand a lot of our teachers. We ask them to not only educate our children to become productive citizens, but also to be counselors, mentors, and role models. And, yes, we ask them to do paperwork on top of that. Should the Senate do everything it can to make it easier for special education teachers to focus on the needs of students instead of focusing on paperwork? Absolutely--but not at the cost of educational accountability and civil rights for students with disabilities. Not if it undermines the foundations of the IDEA. Without the limitations set forth in this amendment, waivers may have the unintended consequence of allowing States to experiment with the civil rights of millions of disabled students for years to come. I do not object to giving States the chance to creatively address the issue of paperwork. This amendment offers States an exciting opportunity to make sure that teachers have more time to plan, take professional development courses, or provide extra help to students. Giving teachers more time means giving them a chance to do what they love most: focus on the needs of students. But the needs of disabled students cannot be met without first guaranteeing that they have the full protection of the law. This amendment provides that guarantee, while still encouraging paperwork reduction, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for offering the amendment that will reduce the paperwork for teachers and also ensure the protection of the rights of disabled children. This amendment draws a clear line between unnecessary paperwork about the process and necessary documentation and ensuring every disabled child's right to a free and appropriate public education. The Senator from Pennsylvania has made it clear that States will not be allowed to waive the civil rights of disabled students or waive procedural safeguards guaranteed under law. This is a good amendment. It balances the needs of both the teachers and students. I thank him for his work on this amendment and also for his accommodation and willingness to work this out. It has been very helpful. I will wait for my colleague, the chairman, before urging the adoption of the amendment, but I expect it will be done momentarily. I suggest the absence of a quorum, with the time to be evenly divided.","word.count":1482,"sep11":2.73876404494382,"years":2004.59831460674,"days":3417,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.856748828697322,"Topic 2":0.0334712513900506,"Topic 3":0.00762643218925446,"Topic 4":0.0566783750580427,"Topic 5":0.00572400920143882,"Topic 6":0.00674008523048073,"Topic 7":0.00675901970075735,"Topic 8":0.0127363874166141,"Topic 9":0.0100071820672525,"Topic 10":0.00350842904878697},{"id":"11020080021549","body":"Leonard L.

I support the decision of the Secretary of Defense to cancel this program. Last month, I actually introduced legislation that would terminate the Crusader, saving the taxpayers an estimated $10 billion over the life of the program. I commend the Secretary of Defense for his efforts to transform our military to meet the challenges of the 21st century and beyond, and agree that the cold war era dinosaurs such as the Crusader should be terminated. The centerpiece of the Crusader system is a 40-ton, 155-millimeter, self-propelled howitzer designed to fire heavy artillery shells long distances to target enemy tanks and other armored vehicles on the battlefield. Each system has two support vehicles. Our military is seeking to be able to deploy rapidly, obviously, to anywhere in the world, but the Crusader apparently is not conducive to such rapid deployment. According to a recent New York Times editorial: An editorial in our leading newspaper in Wisconsin, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, calls the Crusader a gold-plated weapons system and argues the Crusader is too expensive for a time when even a war-engaged Pentagon must make serious choices about how to spend its money. I agree that it is past time the Pentagon reorient its thinking and its spending requests toward the threats of the 21st century and away from the cold war. Cancelling the Crusader is a step in the right direction. The chairman's amendment would transfer the $475.6 million allocated for the Crusader program into a Future Combat Systems line item within the Army's research, development, testing, and evaluation account. In addition, the Army Chief of Staff would be required to prepare a report on alternatives to the Crusader program and submit it to the Secretary within 30 days of the enactment of this bill. This report would include an analysis of the Army's future artillery needs. I urge the members of the Armed Services Committee and the Appropriations Committee to exercise strict oversight of any reprogramming request that may be submitted as a result of the Army's report. I agree with the chairman of the committee that we should be careful about how the $475.6 million that is shifted into the Future Combat Systems account is allocated. The Future Combat Systems account should not be treated as a blank check. It should not be used as a way to revive part or all of the Crusader program. We should scrutinize carefully how these funds will be spent. I urge my colleagues to support Senator Levin's underlying amendment, and I yield the floor.","word.count":457,"sep11":0.789325842696629,"years":2002.64887640449,"days":2723,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.118345290515595,"Topic 2":0.161336282679532,"Topic 3":0.00947031659456562,"Topic 4":0.0732335926304313,"Topic 5":0.027868299870274,"Topic 6":0.0058509778826627,"Topic 7":0.00902647882273945,"Topic 8":0.195188228942387,"Topic 9":0.365177387413546,"Topic 10":0.034503144648266},{"id":"10419950144732","body":"Craig Thomas: Madam President, on Monday the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee introduced Senate Joint Resolution 43 relative to two recent moves by the central government in the People's Republic of China which are of great concern to me as the chairman of the Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs: the formal charging and trial yesterday of Chinese human rights activist Wei Jingsheng, and the selection by the central authorities in Beijing of a new Panchen Lama. I am an original cosponsor of that legislation, and rise today to express my full support for it. Wei Jingsheng is known as the father of the PRC's modern democracy movement, and has spent a good deal of his adult life in prison as a result of his beliefs. Wei was first arrested in the spring of 1979 for allegedly ``providing foreigners with confidential military information and engaging in activities which pose a threat to state security and designed to overthrow state power;'' the fact that the ``secrets'' had been previously published in a widely-circulated government journal was apparently seen as immaterial. His true offense was participating in the ``Democracy Wall Movement'' by penning a work entitled ``Diwu Xiandaihua--The Fifth Modernization.'' That piece argued that the Communist Party's ``Four Modernizations'' program--to modernize industry, agriculture, science/technology, and the armed forces--would be incomplete without a ``fifth modernization:'' democracy. In addition, he had circulated an article warning that Deng Xiaoping was developing Mao-like dictatorial tendencies. For this, he was sentenced to a loss of political rights for 3 years and 15 years in prison of which he served 14\\1/2\\ years. As part of its bid to host the 2000 Olympics, the PRC released a number of political prisoners in a quid pro quo attempt to influence the choice of the selection committee. As a result, Wei was paroled in September 1993 but was kept under constant surveillance since that time. Upon his release he resumed his prodemocracy activities, writing articles and speaking with foreign journalists and government officials in support of democracy in China. On April 1, 1994, just a few weeks after he had met with Assistant Secretary of State John Shattuck to discuss human rights in the PRC, Wei vanished. While it was known at the time that he had been arrested, no warrant had been issued for his arrest; no formal charges were instituted against him; members of his family were never notified of his arrest or subsequent whereabouts, and the authorities would not even confirm he was being held. Inquires as to his status from organizations and leaders outside of China were rebuffed. On November 21, of this year, 20 months after first being arrested and held without charge, the Xinhua News Agency announced that Wei was being formally charged with ``activities to overthrow the government.'' Although the exact nature of his ``crimes'' was left nebulous, the charge carries the death penalty in the PRC. The PRC, which seems to have learned a thing or two about public relations over the years, conveniently timed the announcement to occur after the completion of the recent APEC meetings in Osaka, Japan, and after the announcement of the 1995 Nobel Peace Prize for which Wei had been nominated; both events would have provided an uncomfortable forum for international criticism of the charges. Instead, they have until the next meeting of the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva next March to try and convict Wei and the hope that any international uproar will die down. A Xinhua report this last Sunday noted that Wei's trial would begin today in the Beijing Intermediate People's Court. As of 48 hours before the trial was scheduled to begin, Wei's attorney--Zhang Sishi--had still not received written notice of the charges against his client, nor had he been allowed to meet with him. Although it has been announced that the trial will be--somewhat uncharacteristically--``open,'' that means only that some of Wei's family members may be allowed to attend along with other individuals picked by the government. Late yesterday, after a 6-hour trial, Wei was sentenced to a 14 year term of imprisonment. I am deeply concerned with the use of the Chinese criminal code to silence those who peacefully advocate democratization and who exercise their rights to free speech. I am equally worried by the response, or should I say lack of response, from the Clinton administration. Candidate Clinton was long on talk about Republicans ``coddling dictators,'' and how he would make human rights the foundation of his foreign policy. But as we have seen with so many other issues, he apparently did not mean what he said; as far as I can tell, that foundation is cracked. The Clinton administration has been slowly ceding ground on this issue with the Chinese since he took office. Instead of high-level reactions to the Wei arrest and trial, I have seen only low-level, lukewarm, noncommittal expressions of concern from Foggy Bottom. In 1986, in a speech urging his fellow party leaders to take a hard- line on domestic critics of the government, Deng Xiaoping used Wei as an example: Whether Wei's predicament is to be a bargaining tool for the March U.N. meeting, or signals a shift towards the conservatives in the party hierarchy, President Clinton's lack of response at this time can only embolden China, and place at risk the freedom of others in the democracy movement such as student leader Wang Dan, activist Li Guotao, trade unionist Liu Nianchun, academician Yuan Hongbing and religious activist Xiao Biguang. All have disappeared in the last 2 years. Turning to the issue of the Panchen Lama, it is a central belief in Tibetan Buddhism that certain deities take human form in the bodies of important lamas to lead believers toward enlightenment. It is believed that the souls of these lamas are reborn shortly after their deaths into the bodies of newborn infants in order to continue their task on earth. Known generically as tulku, the two most important of these lamas are the Dalai Lama, the temporal and spiritual head of Tibet, and the Panchen Lama. The Panchen Lama is believed to be a reincarnation of the Buddha Amitabha, the Buddha of Infinite Light. Because he wields the highest temporal as well as spiritual authority, the Dalai Lama is considered preeminent to the Panchen in the lamaist hierarchy. Since the occupation of Tibet beginning in the late 1940's, the Chinese have sought to coopt the Panchen Lama in an attempt to counter the role and authority of the Dalai Lama. When the Chinese invaded Tibet and overthrew the legitimate government, the Dalai Lama fled to northern India where he established a Tibetan government-in-exile. The 10th Panchen Lama remained behind however, effectively becoming over the years the Vidkun Quisling of Tibet, assisting the Chinese in the ``peaceful liberation'' of Tibet. As reported in the November 11 edition of Xzang Ribao: He became a member of the Chinese-installed Communist government, and regularly called on Tibetans to submit to the new order. In frequent statements he praised the new Communist government, and over the years gave legitimacy to the Chinese occupation. Although he apparently had a change of heart at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, for which he was jailed for nearly a decade, after his rehabilitation in 1978 he continued to refuse to back calls for Tibetan independence. Since the death of the Panchen Lama in January 1989, observers have expected a clash between the Tibetans and the Chinese over the choice of the lama's reincarnation. The reason is simple: this conflict is not simply some arcane religious tussle, but is part of the ongoing collision of interests over who really rules Tibet. For the first time, the Chinese were presented with the opportunity of hand-picking and shaping in their own political image from his youth a traditional leader of the Tibetan people. With the prospect of grooming a credible and more compliant alternative leader for the Tibetan people, few believed that the Chinese would acquiesce to the rightful authority of the Dalai Lama and Tibetan Buddhist hierarchy in the choice. Soon after the Panchen's death, negotiations took place between the central government and the group charged with searching for his reincarnation, the monks of Tashilhunpo-- ``Mass of Glory''--Monastery in Shigatse, the traditional seat of the Panchen Lama. The compromise reached provided that the monks would look for the reincarnate lama only in China and Tibet, thus precluding a candidate being found among the Dalai Lama's Tibetan supporters in exile in India. In return, the monks were promised that they could use traditional procedures to select the reborn lama. A committee of monks from the Tashilhunpo began to search for the reincarnate lama by consulting religious oracles and searching for omens in the reflective waters of a lake high in the Himalayas. The committee then visited children in villages around the country who were reported to have certain physical and mental indications of being reincarnate. The committee spent more than 5 years examining various candidates. As they finalized their choice, to the chagrin of the authorities in Beijing word was leaked from the search committee to the Dalai Lama of the identity of the candidates. This allowed the Dalai Lama, who the Chinese for the first time had excluded from his traditional role in the process, to act preemptively and announce on May 14 that the search committee had found the reincarnation of the Panchen Lama in the person of 6-year-old Gedhum Chokyi Nyima in the Tibetan village of Nagchu, Lhari District, north of Lhasa. Their loss of control over the process infuriated the Chinese, who denounced the proclamation in predictably Communist rhetoric.

Today, because of local government authorities, homosexual couples are able to be married in certain States and cities in our country.

Congress must take a stand now against these efforts to thwart the will of Congress, State legislatures, and the American people. Thus far, Federal law has not stopped courts from ruling in favor of these illegal unions.

America's asylum laws are intended to provide refuge for aliens whose lives or freedom are threatened on account of their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. But our current asylum system is riddled with abuse. For example, 31 percent of aliens who apply for asylum never show up for the INS interview that is scheduled to evaluate the legitimacy of their asylum claim. In addition, thousands of aliens who are in the process of being deported claim political asylum at the very last opportunity, thereby triggering a lengthy process of hearings and appeals which further delay deportation. Last August I introduced legislation, H.R. 2182, that would prohibit an alien from seeking asylum in the United States if the alien had first traveled through a country that offers political asylum. These countries are called countries of safe haven. My legislation sought to restore the integrity of our asylum laws by requiring asylum seekers to remain in the first country that would offer them safe haven in an effort to seek better economic opportunities in the United States would be prohibited from entering our country with certain exceptions. I am pleased that the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Smith] has adopted many elements of my legislation in H.R. 2202.

In recent years. the Supreme Court has worked to chip away at civil rights laws. This legislation is designed to address many of these decisions, particularly with respect to statutes governing recipients of federal assistance. This bill is important to all Americans because it ensures that everyone will be treated with fairness and equity under the laws of this country. As a longstanding advocate for disability rights, I am particularly pleased that this bill will reverse some decisions that have limited civil rights protections for people with disabilities. For example, this legislation will reverse some Supreme Court cases which limit the damage awards for intentional discrimination. A recent egregious example is Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U.S. 181, 2002. This case was brought by an individual who used a wheelchair and was forced into a police van that was not equipped with the proper restraints. Despite his objections to the officers, the individual was strapped in with improper belts that came loose, throwing him to the floor. The Supreme Court held that this individual could not seek punitive damages under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act for this mistreatment. The Fairness Act will restore his rights and those of others who have suffered discrimination. It will also reverse Buchannon Bd. &amp; Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dep't of Health &amp; Human Resources, 532 U.S. 598, 2001. In that case, the defendant had been sued under the ADA and the Fair Housing Act. The Court held that even if the lawsuit causes the defendants to voluntarily make changes, the plaintiff cannot recover attorneys' fees unless he or she has been awarded relief by a court. This case has made it extremely difficult to find attorneys to take disability cases. The Fairness Act will also clarify that passengers with disabilities may sue for violations of the Air Carriers Access Act, ACCA, and its regulations. A circuit court recently applied the Supreme Court's decision in Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. to prohibit suits under the ACAA. Congress intended that individuals have the ability to seek redress for violations of this statute. The bill, however, does not address individuals with disabilities in some areas because Congress already has provided clear protection for them. So, for example, Congress has clearly indicated that a private right of action exists to enforce disparate impact disability-based discrimination under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Congress approved of the regulations promulgated to implement section 504 and incorporated these regulations into the statutory requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The bill also does not address the disability-specific negative decisions of the Supreme Court. These decisions have undermined the ADA by dramatically narrowing those who are covered under the Act and imposing other restrictions. As the lead sponsor of the ADA in the Senate, I believe that these cases directly conflict with congressional intent. I am working with the disability community and others to address these cases. The Fairness Act is aptly named. It is designed to ensure that everyone is treated equally under the law and that America will be a Nation that protects and enforces the civil rights of all its citizens. S. 2091.

This legislation would authorize the Department of Health and Human Services to oversee the creation of a secure web site that would link every domestic violence shelter and service provider in the United States and the National Domestic Violence Hotline. The objective is to enable victims of domestic violence and their families who are seeking safety from abuse to more quickly and easily find the shelter and other services they so desperately need. The secure and confidential web site would keep a continuously updated, nationwide list of available shelter and services, such as transportation and children's services, for victims of domestic violence and their families. Once the web site is operational, whenever a woman calls the Hotline, a shelter or other domestic violence project, the operator can immediately check the site and get an up-to-date listing of available shelters and services around the country. With a single phone call, a victim of domestic violence and her family can be placed in the most appropriate shelter to meet their needs or more quickly obtain the other services that will enable them to escape a dangerous situation. Domestic violence is the number one cause of injury to women in the United States. In this country, a woman is battered every 15 seconds. It is estimated that one in five women admitted to emergency rooms is there due to battering. Almost one-third of the American women murdered each year are killed by their current or former partners, usually a husband. In the State of Maine, the overall crime rate dropped by 12 percent in 2000, but domestic violence reports increased by 12.5 percent. It is the leading cause of murder in Maine, resulting in over half the state's homicides. Even when children aren't the target of family violence, those who witness abuse in their homes do not escape unscathed. Tragically, they too are victims, with effects that can include physical, psychological and behavioral problems. Moreover, many of the millions of children who suffer or witness abuse in their homes grow up to perpetuate the legacy of family violence. A report by the American Psychological Association found that a ``child's exposure to the father abusing the mother is the strongest risk for transmitting violent behavior from one generation to the next.'' According to one estimate by the American Medical Association, domestic violence costs the nation from $5 to $10 billion annually in medical expenses, police and court costs, shelters and foster care, sick leave, absenteeism, and nonproductivity. Add the untold costs in suffering and destroyed lives caused by domestic abuse, and the need to more effectively intervene and break the cycle of violence becomes even more compelling. Information technology has improved many aspects of our lives in recent years, and it is time we used advances in technology to help victims and break the cycle of domestic violence. The National Domestic Violence Hotline Enhancement Act will do just that by more effectively helping women and children escape unsafe and violent situations. To achieve the goal of linking the National Domestic Violence Hotline and every domestic violence shelter and service provider on an electronic network, the legislation authorizes the use of funds to provide Internet access and training to shelters that currently do not have the necessary technology. This is a critical element of the bill because only 43 percent of shelters in the United States have Internet access, leaving over half of all shelters without services that many of us now take for granted. The National Domestic Violence Hotline Enhancement Act would create a national domestic violence website and secure network, and it will give service providers the tools to both contribute to and benefit from that network. By doing so, the bill would help ensure that hundreds of thousands of women and children in need of help to escape violence will find the safety and well-being they deserve. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. S. 2003.

It is absurd that we are paying this kind of interest on our national debt. Now, this amendment does not go a long way to retiring that debt, but it is a symbolic gesture of what we should be doing, and that is practicing fiscal discipline.

He later went on to become a Pacific Fleet naval Air Force commander in 1987 and was promoted to vice admiral.

I found him to be a fierce and eloquent defender of the Navy and of the military. Admiral Fetterman, in 1991, became the chief of Naval Education and Training at Pensacola Naval Air Station. He created and was the father of the Core Values Training Program, which earned him the title of the ``Father of Navy Ethics.'' Admiral Fetterman retired as a three-star admiral in 1993. But upon his retirement, he did not just retire, he continued his love of the Navy and his service to the Nation by becoming the president and CEO of the Naval Aviation Museum Foundation. Admiral Fetterman, with a great deal of love and care, guided and directed the Museum of Naval Aviation in Pensacola, which is truly a wonderful and remarkable place where the many heroic feats of people over the years connected to naval aviation are recorded and appreciated.

The United States military is paying $3.23 a gallon in Iraq. That's $153 million per month. At the same time, Iraqis, when they can get gas, are paying $1.30 per gallon of gas. What is wrong with this picture? Our military is paying $3.23 to buy gas in Iraq on our dime, and Iraqis are getting it at $1.30. So again, it's this question of as Americans, and being the great people that we are and trying to do what we can to help here and there, what can we do differently to help protect Americans deal with their daily lives and, at the same time, protect our country?","word.count":215,"sep11":6.76685393258427,"years":2008.62640449438,"days":4851,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.384427433698499,"Topic 2":0.403983913108846,"Topic 3":0.0208282436102367,"Topic 4":0.044253575079885,"Topic 5":0.0423994885843046,"Topic 6":0.0154260938846337,"Topic 7":0.0190998688255588,"Topic 8":0.0237508636546412,"Topic 9":0.0324968011446854,"Topic 10":0.0133337184087089},{"id":"10920060041474","body":"Susan Collins: Mr. President, I do not anticipate taking the full 15 minutes, but I did want to alert my colleagues to an amendment that I believe will be coming up this afternoon, or perhaps even later this morning. In any event, later today Senators McCain, Lieberman, and I will be offering an amendment to the ethics bill before us to create an Office of Public Integrity. The American people view the way that we enforce ethics requirements on each other and on our staff as an inherently conflicted process. We set our own rules, we are our own advisers, we are our own investigators, we are our own prosecutors, we are our own judges, and we are our own juries. Even though we have some of our finest Members serving on the Ethics Committee, they cannot escape the perception that the process is plagued by conflict of interest. We do have extraordinary capable, ethical individuals serving on the Ethics Committee in the Senate. We are very fortunate to have a committee that works in harmony and that takes its job very seriously. I believe we can preserve the important role of the Ethics Committee--and it is a vital role because the Constitution requires each House of Congress to discipline its own Members, if necessary, and we are going to preserve that absolutely critical role--but that we can make an improvement in the process by creating a congressional office, the Office of Public Integrity. I emphasize this is part of the legislative branch. We are not talking, as some have, about creating an outside commission of judges and former Members of Congress and ethics experts. We are talking about recognizing that the Constitution clearly places responsibility within the legislative branch for taking actions, if necessary, against its own Members who violate the House or Senate rules. But we believe that process would be enhanced if we create an office of public integrity. It would be headed by a director who would be appointed by the majority and minority leaders of the Senate. That office would conduct investigations of possible ethics violations independent of any direct supervision by the Senate. So we would be assured that the public would perceive the process--the investigation--as more credible than now occurs when the Ethics Committee is investigating allegations against their colleagues. I wish to point out, however, this is not the Shays-Meehan bill in the House, whatever the merits of that approach. This is a different approach from that taken by the Senator from Illinois, Senator Obama, and it is even different from the proposal Senator Lieberman and I advanced in the Homeland Security markup. We have refined it still further. We narrowed the authority of the Office of Public Integrity, and I think we struck exactly the right balance between the duties of this office and the duties of the Ethics Committee. This office would conduct impartial, independent, thorough investigations and report its findings to the Ethics Committee which then would retain authority to rule on the cases and allegations and decide what action, if any, is taken. This would enhance the public confidence that this investigation would be an independent one. It is very difficult for us to investigate ourselves. There are friendships, there are inherent conflicts of interest. The Ethics Committee does a terrific job in the Senate. It has wonderful members serving on it, individuals of the highest integrity. But the public perception is always going to be that this is an inherently conflicted process because we are investigating ourselves. We are playing every role in the process. What we are trying to do is create an office that would conduct the investigation. I know many of our colleagues are not comfortable with this concept. Some of them have compared it to the old special prosecutor laws. But that is not what we are doing. We are very carefully setting up a system of checks and balances with the Ethics Committee retaining all of the final authority to decide how to proceed, to decide whether subpoenas should be employed, to decide whether an investigation should go forward in the first place, and to decide the ultimate disposition of the case. The investigation would be done by this independent office. I point out to my colleagues one of the advantages of having an independent Office of Public Integrity conduct the investigation. The public now is often skeptical of the findings and actions taken by the Ethics Committee. If the Office of Public Integrity comes to the Ethics Committee and says these allegations have been thoroughly investigated, we, an independent entity, have investigated these allegations and we find there is no truth to them, that finding is much more likely to be accepted by the public if the investigation is done by this independent office. It would have complete credibility. That would be a great advantage. It would remove the cloud of doubt and suspicion that often hangs over Members of Congress unfairly when allegations are made against them. The reason the public often has those doubts is they know we are investigating ourselves. They know our colleagues are investigating allegations against their colleagues. If we insert this Office of Public Integrity into the process, public confidence in the thoroughness, independence, and credibility of the investigations would be enhanced. It would in no way diminish the authority of the Ethics Committee to take the action, make the final judgments, and indeed judgments all along the way, on this case. I reserve the remainder of my time.","word.count":922,"sep11":4.66011235955056,"years":2006.51966292135,"days":4101,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.746514949327888,"Topic 2":0.0844070894213396,"Topic 3":0.0183637780457605,"Topic 4":0.0390154274246368,"Topic 5":0.0187238754093806,"Topic 6":0.0175150798849644,"Topic 7":0.0146157205104219,"Topic 8":0.0319025652509988,"Topic 9":0.0203689196321107,"Topic 10":0.00857259509249873},{"id":"10519970063617","body":"James Inhofe: The yeas and nays have been ordered?","word.count":204,"sep11":-4.33988764044944,"years":1997.51966292135,"days":897,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0118376348103117,"Topic 2":0.021780414351797,"Topic 3":0.0255434850987674,"Topic 4":0.0360986703709089,"Topic 5":0.00642961465176899,"Topic 6":0.00954020021480476,"Topic 7":0.0650991766907118,"Topic 8":0.38687920841779,"Topic 9":0.339545065580161,"Topic 10":0.097246529812978},{"id":"10620000000698","body":"David McIntosh: Mr. Speaker, my topic today will be exactly the topic that the gentleman prior to me spoke about, the elimination of the marriage tax penalty. And, in a way, I am glad he came and spoke to us about that, because the point he made is we have to do this within the context of a balanced budget. But he talked about a surplus of $1.8 trillion over the next 10 years. The bill that is being marked up today in committee, which is a bipartisan bill, the Weller-McIntosh-Danner Marriage Penalty Elimination Bill, that will impact that budget only by one-tenth of that projected surplus, or $180 billion. So I say to my colleagues that I disagree with the gentleman from Minnesota . We must move forward now, in fact, we should have done it yesterday, to eliminate this marriage penalty in our Tax Code. Now, there are organized lobbies for all the other things he mentioned. There are organized lobbies for payments to hospitals, payments to farmers; there are organized lobbies for tax credits to businesses; there are organized lobbies that petition us daily to spend money on all of that reflected on his pie chart. But there are no organized lobbies here in Washington saying protect families from having to pay an additional burden on their taxes. I want to thank my cosponsors, the gentleman from Illinois and the gentlewoman from Missouri , for helping me to create the bipartisan momentum so that this Congress now can finally do something for those families. We do not have to wait. We should not wait. We know what needs to get done. Now, let me share with my colleagues during this hour some of the complex parts of this marriage penalty, and then I want to also introduce some of our friends and colleagues who have been supporters of it. But I want to start this with a reflection of 3 years ago. Three years ago this month I received a letter that changed my career in Congress. It was a letter from a constituent of mine talking about how the marriage penalty affected her and urging me to do something about it. And that changed my priorities on what I was going to fight for here in Washington, and I have been fighting to eliminate that marriage penalty really ever since I got that letter. So I want to share with my colleagues now, 3 years later, what a young lady from my Congressional District, a young lady named Sharon Mallory, wrote to me that got me thinking about our priorities here. She said, ``Dear Representative McIntosh: My boyfriend, Darryl Pierce, and I have been living together for quite some time. We would very much like to get married. We both work at the Ford Electronics in Connersville.'' It is a factory there. ``We both make less than $10 an hour, however, we try to work overtime whenever it is available, and also Darryl does some farming on the side.'' So my colleagues can see Sharon and Darryl are your typical middle- class working family. She goes on to say, ``I can't tell you how disgusted we both are over this tax issue. If we get married, not only would I forfeit my $900 tax refund check, we would be writing a check to the IRS for $2,800. This amount was figured for us by an accountant at the local H&amp;R Block office in New Castle. ``Now, there is nothing right about this. After we continually hear government preach to us about family values. Nothing new about the hypocrites in Washington.'' As my colleagues can see, Sharon had some harsh words for us here, ``Why don't we do away with the current tax system? It is old and outdated, antiquated. ``The flat tax is the most sensible method to use, and no one is being penalized; everyone would be treated the same. I don't understand how the government can ask such questions as are you single? Are you married? Do you have any dependents? Employers, bankers, realtors and creditors are forbidden by law to ask these questions. The same should apply to the government.'' This is what really got my attention, I have to share with my colleagues when I read this letter, ``Darryl and I would very much like to be married. And I must say it broke our hearts when we found out we cannot afford it. We hope some day, some day, the government will allow us to get married by not penalizing us, Sharon Mallory and Darryl Pierce.'' As I said, that letter changed my life, because it changed the priorities that I have in working here in Washington. I brought Sharon and Darryl out here to a hearing a few years ago. They shared with my colleagues the penalty that is stopping them from getting married. They shared with the Speaker the plight they had. He became a cosponsor of our bill. My fondest hope is when I return home after this session of Congress I can get together with Sharon and Darryl and say we did it; we eliminated the marriage penalty tax for you and married couples all over this country. Now, let me introduce a gentleman who has been waiting very patiently today to join us in this special order, a colleague of mine who has a lot of experience and wisdom about how this process works. I yield to the gentleman from New Mexico to talk about this issue.","word.count":919,"sep11":-1.64887640449438,"years":2000.2106741573,"days":1855,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0429688757584504,"Topic 2":0.329832101110524,"Topic 3":0.0479232243358087,"Topic 4":0.536801265793724,"Topic 5":0.00470193804603352,"Topic 6":0.00110716418921271,"Topic 7":0.00557084846796952,"Topic 8":0.00176340390219428,"Topic 9":0.0145566565045503,"Topic 10":0.0147745218915327},{"id":"10820030064498","body":"Hillary Clinton: Without objection, it is so ordered.

We are going through massive problems right now, Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman from Missouri and the gentleman from South Carolina have said over and over again. This is in fact our 27th deployment of our troops in 6 years. Each of these deployments has not been planned for, has not been budgeted for; and, therefore, we have had to take money out of modernization and quality of life to pay to put the troops in harm's way. And when our colleagues vote in favor of this amendment today, this measure, I would ask our colleagues to understand, this is not just a cheerleading session where we stand up and go, rah-rah, yeah for the troops. We need the funding to support these troops. We need to put the dollars on the table. Because when we send these bombers into Iraq, when we send these troops overseas, there are added costs that we do not have the money for.

Mr. President, as part of the million-dollar Seniors Coalition ad campaign that we are talking about, the television commercials state that in the Republican plan there are ``no cuts in benefits.'' The facts are simple and indicate otherwise. With this particular Republican plan that the ad campaign is supporting, $270 billion will taken out of Medicare. The question is this: If this level of cuts causes the only hospital to which we have access to close its doors, is this not a cut in benefits? In rural America this is exactly what is about to happen to hundreds of hospitals. Second, if this level of cuts causes the nursing home or a doctor in our town to stop taking Medicare beneficiaries, is this not a cut in benefits? Third, if this gives incentives to home health care agencies and other providers to treat only healthy people, is this not a cut for older and more frail citizens? There is another claim expressed in this television commercial. This commercial states that ``the Republican plan increases spending by nearly $2,000 per senior.'' The fact is, Mr. President, that the yearly per beneficiary growth rate allowed under this plan is 4.9 percent. It is, in fact, much below the expected 7.1 percent growth rate in private sector health care costs. Medicare's ability to respond to health care costs decreases with the severity of these cuts. Mr. President, the commercial further states that the Republican plan gives ``patients more choices.'' The fact is what good is offering choices when only bad choices are offered? While seniors may have more health care plans to choose from, choosing the one that they can afford may mean they must give up their choice of a physician. And, finally, the proposed medical savings account threatens the viability of Medicare by allowing insurance companies to cherry-pick by moving healthy, wealthy people out of the Medicare pool. The result would be far higher costs to the beneficiaries who stay in Medicare. Also, the Seniors Coalition television ad says nothing about the Republicans using the cuts in Medicare to fund tax breaks for the wealthy. Why is this, Mr. President? It is perhaps because seniors who are actually paying for these commercials do not want the Medicare Program to be cut to fund tax breaks. I think this is a legitimate question. Mr. President, only $89 billion is actually needed to shore up Medicare's trust fund in the short term. Why then are our people not being told where the $181 billion cuts are actually going to go? Were those same seniors who sent their dollars to Mr. Viguerie's groups told this? Of course not. They have been used, they have been abused, and they have been manipulated by a slick campaign of distortion and untruths. Mr. President, this is a situation where the seniors of America are being scared to death. They are sending their money in to basically, as the letters call for, to protect Medicare. Mr. President, this television advertising campaign cost the Seniors Coalition $1 million and is running in 19 markets across the country. I want to make sure everyone knows that this campaign was paid for by the elderly, many of them poor and disabled, who sent in money thinking that the Seniors Coalition was going to lobby the Congress to save their Medicare Program-- not cut it. That is why my advice to seniors who are thinking about sending their hard-earned savings to these three so-called seniors groups is that ``Contributions May Be Hazardous to Your Health.'' They should think twice before writing a check to a Viguerie-founded group. As I said earlier, I am here today to sound the alarm and expose this scam. I am concerned not only because some seniors are being taken advantage of, but also because this scam is a cynical manipulation of our political process. It threatens the democratic principles under which we operate. Americans who think they are getting involved with the political process are actually being financially exploited. Furthermore, they are not being represented the way they think they are. This is a perfect example of why so many people today have such little confidence in our political system. Mr. President, older Americans--all Americans--can say ``no'' to this type of cynical manipulation and misrepresentation. Let me encourage every senior to get involved with reform of their Medicare [[Page S 15520]] Program. They can write a letter to us in the Senate. They can call. They can visit. They can fax. But, they do not need to send money to a direct-mail vendor in order to be heard in the Congress. Mr. President, before seniors send in $10, $20, or $30 to these so- called seniors groups they should consider the following. The most effective way only costs 32 cents. I will always place more importance on a personal letter or a visit from one of my constituents than on a letter or preprinted card from a group that distorts their views. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record certain material, editorials, and extraneous matter that relate to this issue that I have discussed this morning.

This bill sounds good on its face, and it might make us feel like we're striking a blow against North Korea, but I believe its passage today is a mistake. First, if this bill becomes law, it will make it virtually impossible for the United States to keep the commitments we made in the 1994 Agreed Framework. That was the deal designed to end North Korea's nuclear program. Slowly but surely, and despite its critics' dire warnings, it is succeeding. This bill would block delivery of key components to the light-water reactors now under construction by a South Korean firm. Those components are not the core reactors, whose installation will come only when the United States, South Korea and Japan are confident that North Korea no longer poses a nuclear threat. Instead, the affected items are more basic components that would be denied much sooner, and at a critical moment in this process of eliminating North Korea's nuclear capabilities. My second objection is that our timing is terrible. For the first time since the Korean nation was split in two, a summit has been scheduled between the leaders of the North and South. Hopes are high that President Kim Dae Jung and General Kim Jong II will make progress toward peace, or at least a more permanent end to the tense stand-off that has blighted Korea's history for 50 years. In less than a month, South Korea's elected president--a national hero known for his courage in pressing for human rights--will meet with North Korea's new leader--a man who has broken his predecessors' tradition of isolation and hostility by reaching out to the United States and other nations. The North-South summit is an historic initiative that tour country should support. Instead, by this vote we risk signaling to Koreans in both nations that they cannot trust the United States to keep our solemn commitments. With 37,000 Americans stationed along one of the world's most dangerous borders, ending the Korean War--or even lessening the hostile situation--should be our country's highest priority. This bill will take us further from that goal. Mr. Speaker, our allies in South Korea have grave concerns about this bill. Few of us expect it to win Senate passage or, if it does, the President's approval.

Senator Cohen leaves behind a long and impressive career of public service for the people of Maine. With his election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1973, Senator Cohen represented his constituents from Maine diligently, and continued his efforts upon his election to the U.S. Senate in 1978. Mr. President, Senator Cohen has remained a moderate and thoughtful voice in a Senate that is increasingly marked by strident and partisan debate. Senator Cohen has attempted to rise above partisan politics to accomplish what is best for the people of Maine and the Nation. In 1991, Senator Cohen voted to override a veto of an extension of unemployment benefits, at a time when America's families were beginning to feel the effects of an economic recession. In the 103d Congress, Senator Cohen participated in a bipartisan coalition that attempted to overhaul the U.S. health care system, after the administration's efforts were not successful. During the 104th Congress, I have had the distinct pleasure of working with Senator Cohen in the Centrist Coalition. A group of about 20 Senators, the Centrist Coalition worked to reach agreement on a comprehensive budget alternative to those put forward by President Clinton and the Republican leadership. The plan we developed built upon the suggestions of the National Governors' Association with respect to the Medicaid and welfare programs. It also built in needed flexibility for States, while preserving the social safety net for our Nation's most vulnerable populations. It was the only bipartisan budget alternative that received significant support in the 104th Congress, and I am proud to have been part of that effort. Mr. President, throughout his political career Senator Cohen has held government officials accountable to the high ethical standards that people expect of their elected leaders, regardless of party affiliation. This was evident during courageous votes he made during Watergate and the investigation of the Iran Contra affair. Senator Cohen also helped create the independent counsel law, which mandates the appointment of an independent counsel to probe allegations against certain high executive branch officials. Further, Senator Cohen sponsored legislation to require that contacts between lobbyists and Members of Congress are officially reported. Mr. President, we are all grateful for Senator Cohen's dedicated service and tireless efforts in the U.S. Senate. Senator Cohen's distinguished Senate career is a testament to his hard work on behalf of the people of Maine and the Nation. His insightful approach to the challenges we face as a nation will be greatly missed.","word.count":441,"sep11":-5.08988764044944,"years":1996.76966292135,"days":630,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.359843485053067,"Topic 2":0.159909387250164,"Topic 3":0.0870228624074592,"Topic 4":0.0440180514436269,"Topic 5":0.00504594569715837,"Topic 6":0.00766925012308351,"Topic 7":0.282101888880213,"Topic 8":0.00577950185041195,"Topic 9":0.0467625559728718,"Topic 10":0.00184707132194389},{"id":"10820030025612","body":"Pete Sessions: Yes, it is.

The bill will provide consumers with greater tools to improve the accuracy and correctness of information contained in their credit reports as well as to provide important tools for consumers in combating identity theft. This bill is a very proconsumer bill and goes a long way towards enhancing consumer protections in our credit markets. When the Fair Credit Reporting Act was first adopted in 1970, consumers spending had reached 566 billion dollars. At the time, that was quite an outstanding figure. By 2002, that figure had risen to over $7 trillion. In just this past decade alone, we have seen tremendous growth in the availability of credit. Much of this can be attributed to the technological advances in the way consumers can apply for credit, the review of credit applications by financial institutions, and the development of new and unique financial products. The incredible growth in the availability of credit in the housing, consumer, and small business markets is a testament to our financial markets. Accordingly, it also is a symbol of the national structure of our credit markets. I believe that this bill will further enhance the credit markets and provide significant consumer protections. Two areas that I would like to focus on are financial literacy and identity theft. With respect to financial literacy, I have witnessed how financial literacy programs can make a difference for individuals who wish to, but never thought they could, purchase a home. In Wyoming, I have worked with a consortium of financial institutions, real estate professionals, colleges and universities, and non-profits to provide compressed video classes on how to buy a home. These classes have proven to be vital in reaching home-buyers and families in the rural areas of the State. To date, more than 4,000 families and individuals have taken part in the classes. The great success of this program has demonstrated to me the power that we can give to individuals and families over their finances if we gave them the tools. In addition, I also worked with consumer credit counseling services that helped over-extended individuals and families to rearrange their life and breakout of debt. Credible advice makes a difference for financial power. The Federal Government has a vast variety of financial literacy and education programs for Americans of all ages. Unfortunately, consumers have to struggle through the many Federal agencies' programs and initiatives to find the right financial literacy material for their needs. Title V of this bill will provide a one-stop-shop for consumers to reach the many, various financial literacy programs that the Federal Government provides. In addition, the Title will help bring consistency and focus to the Federal Government's overall financial literacy goals--something that does not appear apparent at this time. Title V is built upon the successful model of the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee in that it would being the appropriate Federal agencies together to review and evaluate current financial literacy programs by the Federal Government. The Financial Literacy and Education Commission will make recommendations on how to coordinate and improve existing programs as well as how to reduce redundant and duplicative programs. I believe that the long-term cost savings to the Federal Government as a result of this review will be great. In addition, the commission will set forth a national strategy recommending changes to the President and Congress on how the Federal agencies can improve their financial literacy efforts. I thank Chairman Shelby for incorporating the bipartisan effort to promote financial literacy as Title V of the bill. In addition, I thank Senators Sarbanes and Stabenow as well as the other members who supported this effort. With respect to identity theft, the FTC recently released a study showing that more than 27.3 million consumers have been a victim of identity theft in the past five years and that the number is growing quickly. A little more than a month ago, one of my own staff became a victim of this crime. As you know, Senator Cantwell and I have introduced identity theft legislation to help victims to recover their identities, that legislation passed the Senate last Congress. According to the Federal Trade Commission, identity theft is the fastest growing crime facing consumers today. Victims are faced with potential financial ruin when their identities, bank accounts, and credit histories are taken away from them by unscrupulous criminals. Unfortunately, many victims face an uphill battle to restore their identities. In addition, Federal and local law enforcement officials are placed at a disadvantage by not having all of the available information to discover identity theft rings or patterns of id theft criminals. I believe that the provisions in the bill before us take a great step in helping the victims of this crime recover as well as providing proactive tools to help consumers prevent their identities from being stolen. In addition, the bill will give greater significant to the Identity Theft Affidavit and to the collection of information to combat identity theft crimes. The National Consumer Credit Reporting System Improvement Act of 2003 is one of the most important pieces of consumer legislation that we have seen in years. It is truly a bipartisan bill that will enhance the fundamental structure of our credit markets as well as providing consumers with the necessary tools to use the credit markets and to protect against identity theft. I urge my colleagues to pass quickly this very important piece of legislation.","word.count":937,"sep11":2.20224719101124,"years":2004.06179775281,"days":3226,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.034866363400974,"Topic 2":0.170899897526085,"Topic 3":0.0138683331535248,"Topic 4":0.00628717383672389,"Topic 5":0.590885932890119,"Topic 6":0.0572514382269321,"Topic 7":0.00806513126694292,"Topic 8":0.0243950839261333,"Topic 9":0.0582029621397947,"Topic 10":0.03527768363277},{"id":"10419950119256","body":"Slade Gorton: Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from West Virginia for those comments and for that support.

This bill is a product of a remarkable collaborative effort that has involved members of the Committee on the Judiciary and Committee on Energy and Commerce. I would like to especially thank the gentleman from Texas for his excellent cooperation through this entire process. The manager's amendment to the bill, which the Committee on the Judiciary approved unanimously on July 7, 2004, incorporates H.R. 4501 which was the Committee on Energy and Commerce version of the bill reported on July 22. The manager's amendment incorporates important refinements to both the copyright and communications acts. These provisions are designed to extend for an additional 5 years the license that permits satellite TV companies such as DirecTV and EchoStar to retransmit to their subscribers TV programming shown on distant network stations and superstations. The extension will ensure that Americans who live in rural areas where they have trouble receiving signals from the regular broadcast stations will continue to have access to network TV programming. Significantly, this bill does not simply preserve the status quo for the statutory period. Instead, the bill changes both the copyright and communications acts to ensure, first, that consumers will have greater choice in programming; second, that satellite providers will have greater freedom to deliver the content consumers desire; third, that free, over-the-air local broadcasters will have the opportunity to serve needs that are specific to their communities; and, fourth, the copyright owners will enjoy the first compulsory royalty fee adjustment in nearly 5 years. The amendments have been carefully negotiated and crafted. They have benefited from an open process which has involved at least four committee hearings, the introduction and mark-up of two committee- reported bills to the House, and a willingness to consider numerous refinements to achieve the right policy and to gain consensus. As a result, the bill is supported by numerous organizations including the National Association of Broadcasters, numerous local broadcast stations, and the Capital Broadcasting Company. In addition, the royalty provision contained in the judiciary title has been specifically endorsed by effective stakeholders. This is a culmination of a painstaking effort under the leadership of the gentleman from Texas and the ranking member, the gentleman from California , who encouraged affected parties to negotiate a voluntary agreement. As a result, the section 119 rate provisions contained in the manager's amendment are now supported by the two largest DBS providers, DirecTV and EchoStar; their trade association, the Satellite Broadcasting and Communications Association, and major copyright owners including the Motion Picture Association and the Office of the Commission of Baseball. Together those entities represent the copyright owners who receive the overwhelming majority of copyright royalties paid under the license and the satellite carriers who make the vast majority of such payments. In return for extending the license to satellite companies, the bill does require the beneficiaries to accept certain reporting requirements. These requirements are designed to protect the legitimate interests of copyright owners and free over-the-air broadcasters. I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the contributions of the subcommittee chairman, the gentleman from Texas . We could not have reached this point without his steady work. I also want to thank the gentleman from Texas for all his help and support during the process. Thanks also go to other key players, the gentleman from Michigan , the gentleman from Michigan , the gentleman from California , the gentleman from Michigan , and the gentleman from Massachusetts , all of whom have made significant contributions to this effort. I appreciate all their efforts. I am pleased that we have been able to work together in developing this joint bill, and I look forward to building on this success next year. The bill promotes the interests of consumers, satellite providers, broadcasters, and copyright owners. It is a balanced bill and deserves the support of this House. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.","word.count":1357,"sep11":2.12359550561798,"years":2003.98314606742,"days":3198,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.128758524272432,"Topic 2":0.343482103428797,"Topic 3":0.330802937116523,"Topic 4":0.14256178937166,"Topic 5":0.0275452004617662,"Topic 6":0.00347676718853998,"Topic 7":0.00270620653237754,"Topic 8":0.00423575232088275,"Topic 9":0.0140195287107195,"Topic 10":0.0024111905963019},{"id":"11020080065038","body":"Jeff Bingaman: Mr. President, there are over 150 public land bills on the Senate calendar that have been reported from the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources during the 110th Congress, for which we have not been able to get unanimous consent to take up and pass.

When I was a child, this country sold F-15s to Iran so that Iran could be our offset to Soviet power in South Asia. And because we sold F-15s and other arms to Iran, we wound up selling chemical weapon precursor materials to Iraq to offset Iranian power in the Middle East, and today we have 135,000 troops in Iraq, in part, because of those unwise decisions. Now, we are told that we should sell nuclear materials to India, which would free up Indian nuclear reactors to produce many more nuclear weapons for the Indian nuclear weapons program as an offset to Chinese power in Asia. If we approved this deal with India, it would encourage China to increase its nuclear arsenal, and I submit to you that we, that we are one of the potential targets of that enhanced Chinese nuclear arsenal. Even more worrisome is that an Indian nuclear build-up would further accelerate the Pakistani nuclear build-up. While I have strong confidence in the stability of the Indian Government and in the stability of Indian democracy, I have much, much less faith in the stability of the Pakistani Government and of Pakistani democracy, and of the Pakistani Government's ability to keep under control those nuclear weapons which it already has and the additional weapons it would build because of an Indian nuclear build-up. If there is a military coup in Pakistan, we should be very, very concerned about the stability of not only South Asia, but of the world. There have been three military coups in Pakistan since its independence in 1947. Rather than approving nonsignatory states like India in violation of nonproliferation treaties, the better course of action is to respect international agreements and immediately bring to the Senate a total ban on nuclear testing and a comprehensive set of treaties to curtail nuclear proliferation. Back in July, just this summer, there were only 68 of us in this Chamber who voted against approving the legislation to permit sales of nuclear materials to India. I ask more of my colleagues to join me today at this historic moment to prevent adding fuel to the fire of nuclear proliferation in South Asia. This legislation and the following sale of nuclear materials to India blows out of the water any hope we have of treaty constraints on the proliferation of nuclear weapons. I want to make it clear for this record and for history that the actions of this administration in containing nuclear proliferation have been patently irresponsible. This administration has underfunded the Nunn-Lugar legislation which takes nuclear materials out of the open market which would otherwise be available for sale to terrorists. This administration has failed to support internal treaties limiting nuclear weapon proliferation, and now, and now it has proposed a treaty with India that would sell India nuclear materials, which would result in a nuclear arms race between India and China and between India and Pakistan. Pakistan is not a stable country. It is already leaking nuclear weapons technology to other countries and groups. Let the Record show that if or when a mushroom cloud ever erupts over an American city, that event will be traced back to this unwise vote in the United States Senate and to the bone-headed policy of this administration toward treaty obligations, Nunn-Lugar, and the sale of nuclear materials to India. Ladies and gentlemen, compared to this legislation, the authorization to go to war in Iraq was a piker.

It is pretty clear we won't get a bill to the President's desk before we recess for the upcoming mid-term elections. From my perspective the right thing to do is to pass legislation that resolves two important tax policy issues. The issues are a permanent death tax relief package and the trailer bill which contains a retroactive extension of several tax relief provisions. Those provisions expired on December 31, 2005. That is the right date-- December 31, 2005. Taxpayers have lived with uncertainty on these bipartisan, widely-supported provisions for almost 9 months or three- quarters of a year. How did we get here? How come we can't get a permanent death tax relief deal when it is clear that more than 60 Senators are on record in support of repeal or significant relief? How come we can't get a resolution of expired tax provisions that are overwhelmingly supported in both the House and Senate? This uncertainty is solely the responsibility of the leadership of both parties here in the United States Senate. We are stuck on death tax because the Democratic leadership won't let enough Democratic Senators vote their conscience. It's all because of political calculations. That's a shame. Family farmers and small business owners deserve an answer to the uncertainty posed by the death tax. My answer would be to repeal the death tax. Repeal isn't in the cards. We have had votes to prove it. Unfortunately, the political proof that repeal wasn't in the cards didn't materialize until the cloture vote we had back in June. The American people deserve a final and definitive answer on death tax relief. As we go home, they have only to look to the Senate Democratic leadership and ask why the Senate was not permitted to work its will on this issue. I want to tell the rightfully disappointed family farmers and small business folks that we will resolve the death tax problem. It should have been resolved by now. And, it will be resolved in a way that focuses on family farms and small businesses. I pledge to family farmers and small business folks, especially those in my home state of Iowa, that I will devote my energy and resources, as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, to resolving this problem. Let's turn to the trailer bill. It's an odd name for a bill. The bill has been held up for so long some folks have probably forgotten the basis of the nickname. I will remind you. It's a trailer bill because it covers tax provisions that dropped out of the tax relief reconciliation conference agreement. That conference agreement included the cornerstones of both the House and Senate bills. The cornerstone of the House bill was a 2-year extension of the lower rates on capital gains and dividends. The cornerstone of the Senate bill was an extension of the hold-harmless on the alternative minimum tax--``AMT''. I was pleased we covered the cornerstones of both bills. We only had revenue room to cover the cornerstones. The other provisions, principally the tax extenders, were decided to travel in a bill to follow or ``trail.'' Hence the name trailer bill. The trailer bill took several weeks of intense negotiations. The negotiators were Chairman Thomas for the House and Senator Baucus and me for the Senate. They were tough negotiations, but they produced a fair agreement. That agreement was included in the trailer piece of the trifecta. The House ratified Chairman Thomas's agreement when it passed the trifecta. In my view, the agreement is closed. No items should be subtracted. No items should be added. A deal is a deal. Let me repeat that. A deal is a deal. Changes should only occur if all the parties to the agreement consent. We don't have another 5 to 6 weeks to re-negotiate the trailer bill. In getting to that agreement, I pushed hard for several Senate issues to be resolved. I'm referring to items other than the basic 2-year extension of provisions that expired on December 31, 2005. Let me go through a few of those items. First off, there is the abandoned mines reclamation--AML--fund proposal. Senators Santorum, Byrd, and Rockefeller took the lead in this plan. Chairman Enzi did the heavy lifting. Secondly, there is a package of added incentives to enhance Hurricane Katrina rebuilding efforts. Senator Lott took the lead on this package, along with the support of Senators Vitter, and Landrieu. Third, there are tax relief incentives for mine safety. Senators Byrd, Santorum, and Rockefeller argued for these important provisions. Fourth, there is an expansion of the veterans mortgage bonds program. This is a program that the states use to provide veterans who return from combat with low-interest loans so that they can buy their families a home. Senators DeWine and Smith advanced these provisions. Fifth, there is a proposal to provide a deduction for private mortgage insurance--PMI--for low-income home purchasers. Senators Lincoln and Smith worked hard to secure these provisions. Sixth, there is a proposal to level the playing field between individual and corporate timber capital gains transactions. This proposal will insure that timber-growing areas and related mill towns will not be disadvantaged if the timber company is a corporation. Most, not all, of the Senators from the timber growing states in the Pacific Northwest and southeast had an interest in this provision. These are a few of the proposals that were negotiated and resolved in the trailer package. In my role as Finance Committee chairman, I protected these Senate positions. I expect our Senate Leadership to back me as we proceed. I am protecting Senators and Senate positions, so you would think they would automatically back me. To reiterate, a deal is a deal. The House has affirmed the deal with its vote on the trifecta. There should be no backsliding on the deal. Now, we haven't been able to move a separate trailer bill because the Republican Leadership wants to use the trailer as a ``sweetener'' for votes for death tax relief at some future point. I have been pushing for a separate bill for a lot of reasons. Some Republican colleagues have complained about my efforts, using terms like ``whining'' to describe my persistence. Why push so hard for a separate bill, some have asked. There are three key reasons. The first is the 19 million taxpayers who may face compliance problems because of incomplete IRS forms. The second reason is the hundreds of thousands of business taxpayers who have been in limbo waiting for final approval of measures like the research and development tax credit. Third, I'm virtually certain that the leadership's strategy of trying to use unrelated ``sweeteners'' to turn Democratic votes for a death tax deal will continue to fail. Let's go through these reasons, one-by-one. First, take a look at the Finance Committee website. On September 13, and 26, 2006, you will find press releases that explain Finance Committee tax staff research. At my request, the tax staff looked into the effects of delaying action on the three widely-applicable expired middle-income tax relief provisions. I am talking about the deductions for college tuition, teacher's out-of-pocket classroom expenses, and State sales tax. You will see that we are talking about a group of up to 19 million tax filers being affected. Tax filers means families filing jointly and individuals filing as singles. In other words, we are talking about a lot more than 19 million taxpayers. Let me repeat that. More than 19 million taxpayers. The professional staff, all experienced tax practitioners who discussed this problem with the IRS, came to the conclusion that delaying action on extenders into the lame duck would have adverse consequences for that group of 19 million taxpayers. I won't go into details, you will find them on the website. Let me say that serving as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee is a privilege and a responsibility. I thank the people of Iowa and my friends and colleagues in the Senate Republican Caucus for that privilege. I enjoy every day I serve as chairman, but it brings responsibilities as well. One of those responsibilities is tax policy. Now, whether an individual Senator agrees or disagrees with a particular expiring tax relief matter is debatable. We all have opinions on these things. Probably no two Finance Committee members, let alone two U.S. Senators not on the committee, agree on all expiring tax relief measures. What we ought to agree on, is that we should not deliberately, and I underline the word deliberately, take actions to unnecessarily complicate taxpayers' efforts to comply with our admittedly complex tax system. That's what delaying action on these provisions means. There's no ifs, ands, or buts. If we do not act before the 2006 IRS forms are finalized we're causing problems for these 19 million taxpayers. It's just not right. As chairman, I would not be doing my job if I stayed silent. I had to speak out. It's my responsibility to those millions of taxpayers. Some have called it whining. Some might call it annoying. Others could call it persistence. I call it doing my job. When you are talking about up to 19 million middle-income taxpayers who are trying their best to comply with the tax system, I will whine until I run out of breath. I tried to remedy this problem by persuading my leadership to change its mind. I did it in a way that is respectful of the rights and responsibilities of the leadership. I'm disappointed and frustrated that leadership has failed to act. The second reason I pressed for a separate trailer bill is to deal with long-expired business-related tax incentives. These matters, like the research and development tax credit, are overwhelmingly popular in the House and Senate. Businesses have been in limbo on these provisions. We are talking about almost 9 months of limbo now and at least another month of limbo. A lot of businesses, in good faith","word.count":2932,"sep11":5.17977528089888,"years":2007.0393258427,"days":4286,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.290412918292172,"Topic 2":0.12945534686124,"Topic 3":0.0119299850968098,"Topic 4":0.00513735875865842,"Topic 5":0.0126062175659205,"Topic 6":0.448920771027675,"Topic 7":0.00377865644114694,"Topic 8":0.0712520994278075,"Topic 9":0.0236295727007822,"Topic 10":0.0028770738277878},{"id":"10920060053046","body":"Frank Lautenberg: Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the resolution put forward by the senior Senator from Michigan. I appreciate the fact that he has framed the debate on the war in Iraq both for the Senate and for the American people. Last week the American death toll in Iraq passed 2,500. It is a tragic milestone and the American people are not happy about it, because our President has yet to articulate exactly what we are trying to accomplish in Iraq. I maintain a gallery of pictures of U.S. servicepeople who have died in Iraq and Afghanistan outside the front door of my office. It reminds me and all who visit my office about the loss of young lives and the terrible cost of this war. As a war veteran, I know what these troops and their families are going through. I heard the Bush administration say that some Iraqis are worried about us leaving. But I say this: The American people are worried about us staying. What more can we do for the Iraqi people? We have spent over $300 billion of U.S. taxpayer funds there. We have helped them hold three elections. We have trained and armed their police and their military. I say it is time for them to take control of their country. I have heard my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say that we would bring dishonor to those who lost their lives if we begin to leave Iraq. But ask the families with loved ones over there how they feel. I met with a group in my Newark office with loved ones in Iraq, including a mother who lost her son there. As far as they were concerned, it would bring dishonor to other families if we just stay there with no plans for the future. So why are we having so much trouble securing Iraq? The answer is clear: The administration has no plan in place to do it. When they tried, we saw misstep after misstep by the civilian leaders in the Pentagon. And the leadership problems at the Pentagon start at the top. This administration went to war on the cheap: Not enough troops, not enough body armor, not enough help from our allies. I think we are down to a coalition that has very little coalescence attached to it. No help. And our troops have paid the price for these mistakes. There were so many mistakes and miscalculations by the Bush administration that it is hard to believe it at all. Secretary Rumsfeld said the Iraqis would welcome U.S. troops and that the Iraqi resistance would be limited. He was obviously wrong. He also failed to build coalitions with our allies. One of the few major allies that did join the coalition was Poland, which sent about 1,600 troops. But they began withdrawing early this year. Half are already gone, and by the end of the year, Poland will have all of its troops out of Iraq. Just this week, the Japanese announced they will withdraw their troops. We ask, when are we going to start withdrawing our troops? So far, 16 nations who have provided some assistance in Iraq have withdrawn their troops. The administration's failure to build a real coalition has caused our troops to bear the vast majority of the risk and suffer the casualties.","word.count":563,"sep11":4.89887640449438,"years":2006.75842696629,"days":4186,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0808635514568862,"Topic 2":0.0359912811064816,"Topic 3":0.121384181386046,"Topic 4":0.0276658346389917,"Topic 5":0.00852641798334837,"Topic 6":0.00554615867525457,"Topic 7":0.00321025212101272,"Topic 8":0.131713459139922,"Topic 9":0.00849411623184499,"Topic 10":0.576604747260212},{"id":"10620000046418","body":"Herb Kohl: Mr. President, I rise today in support of both the pending amendment and the underlying Education Savings Account bill. Education Savings Accounts will clearly help some families save money for their children's education, but they are only part of the solution to improving education in our country. The amendment proposed by the Senator from Louisiana is another part. It represents the work of several Senators who are trying to take a realistic, effective approach to improving public education. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to take a serious look at our bill, the Public Education Reinvestment, Reinvention, and Responsibility Act--better known as ``Three R's''. We have made great strides in the past six years toward improving public education. Nearly all States now have academic standards in place. More students are taking more challenging courses. Test scores have risen slightly. Dropout rates have decreased. But there are still significant improvements to be made. A recent study of students from 41 different countries found that American students still score far behind those in other countries. Addressing this sort of fundamental failure is going to take more than cosmetic reform. We are going to have to take a fresh look at the structure of Federal education programs. We need to let go of the tired partisan fighting over more spending versus block grants and take a middle ground approach that will truly help our States, school districts--and most importantly, our students. Our ``Three R's'' bill does just that. It makes raising student achievement for all students--and eliminating the achievement gap between low-income and more affluent students--our top priorities. To accomplish this, our bill centers around three principles. First, we believe that we must continue to invest in education, and invest wisely, targeting funds where they are needed the most. Second, we believe that States and local school districts are in the best position to know what their educational needs are. They should be given more flexibility to determine how they will use Federal dollars to meet those needs. And third, and most importantly, in exchange for increased flexibility, public schools must be accountable for results. These principles are a pyramid, with accountability being the base that supports the federal government's grant of flexibility and funds. For too long, we have seen a steady stream of Federal dollars flow to States and school districts--regardless of how well they educate their students. This has to stop. We need to reward schools that do a good job. We need to provide assistance and support to schools that are struggling to do a better job. And we need to stop subsidizing failure. The amendment before us now is the Teacher Quality and Professional Development section of the ``Three R's'' bill. It would increase funding for teacher quality and professional development to $2 billion, and target those funds to the neediest school districts. It gives States and school districts more flexibility to design teacher recruitment, mentoring, and professional development programs. And it requires States and school districts to ensure that every student will be taught by a fully qualified teacher--and holds them accountable for making sure that happens. Mr. President, the amendment before us today is just one part of the ``Three R's'' bill. It focuses on one of the most important parts of improving education--improving teaching. It is an example of how, by using the concepts of increased funding, targeting, flexibility--and most importantly, accountability--we can work with our State and local partners to make sure every child is taught by a qualified teacher. I look forward to continuing to work on these issues when the Senate considers ESEA.","word.count":605,"sep11":-1.56741573033708,"years":2000.29213483146,"days":1884,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0458570464872322,"Topic 2":0.60060810468701,"Topic 3":0.00852263082274088,"Topic 4":0.0454770830923884,"Topic 5":0.071221104206971,"Topic 6":0.00596403374804198,"Topic 7":0.00585590287183004,"Topic 8":0.0953044236506703,"Topic 9":0.0507184685311092,"Topic 10":0.0704712019020059},{"id":"10419960057194","body":"Slade Gorton: Mr. President, we will act tonight on Megan's law, which strengthens and improves a good law, and provides families with needed protection against the most heinous of crimes. Although Megan's law will not affect my State of Washington, which should, and does serve as a model for other States around the country, it will assist those States that, for whatever reason, have been slower to act or more timorous in their fight against crime. In 1994, Congress passed the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act. The act contained a number of good provisions, perhaps the one I cared about most was the provision calling for the registration of sexual offenders and community notification. Most States have already implemented systems to require people who abduct children, or who commit sexual crimes, to register their addresses with State or local law enforcement officials. The provision in the 1994 act, however, was not as tough as I would have liked. The Act permitted State and local law enforcement to notify communities that there was a sexual predator in their midst, but it did not require this notification. We are back now to improve upon that law by requiring community notification. Even with this mandate, however, State and local law enforcement officials, still will retain the substantial discretion to determine when community notification is called for, what information to release, and how to best inform the community. Parents have a right to know that their children are in danger, that the person living next door to them, or down the street is a convicted sexual predator. The need for this notification was tragically illustrated in the case of Megan Kanka, for whom the law before us today is named. Two years ago, Megan was allegedly raped and murdered by a man who lived across the street from her, a man who twice before had been convicted of being a sexual predator, and who lived with two house mates who were themselves sexual predators. Megan's parents did not know this. If they had, they could have advised their daughter not to accept her neighbor's invitation to come into his house to see a puppy.","word.count":360,"sep11":-5.48033707865169,"years":1996.37921348315,"days":491,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.013077103834951,"Topic 2":0.668249341640604,"Topic 3":0.207177813837768,"Topic 4":0.00704212318475811,"Topic 5":0.0418039536288174,"Topic 6":0.0060749166922531,"Topic 7":0.00616789249220878,"Topic 8":0.00767206093957649,"Topic 9":0.0233242842773889,"Topic 10":0.0194105094716743},{"id":"10920060054079","body":"Edward Kennedy: Mr. President, the Bill of Rights is our Nation's greatest accomplishment. It has been our great fortress against the passions and politics of every era. It has been our great beacon to the rest of the world, demonstrating that we value our liberty more deeply than power or riches. And it is fitting that such a document, which describes the rights inherent to a free people, has not been amended-- not once--in its entire 217 years. The Founders knew that the first amendment of the Bill of Rights would allow all manner of speech, including some speech that was contemptible. They were no strangers to fiery rhetoric. Most of them began their public lives not only by making speeches but by engaging in other expressive conduct, such as hanging King George's tax collectors in effigy and dumping tea into Boston Harbor. The breadth of the first amendment is not an accident; it is an essential part of the Founders' design. For the 217 years that followed the adoption of the Bill of Rights, we have managed to preserve every word. Every generation of leaders-- until today--considered the Bill of Rights to be sacred and recognized that they could not claim to be protecting our freedoms by curtailing them. And the past 217 years have proved that we can survive civil wars and world wars, fascism, communism, economic collapse and all manner of civil strife--all without diluting the Bill of Rights. So why are we addressing flag burning? I completely agree that flag burning is a contemptible and malicious act, calculated to outrage rather than persuade. But flag burning occurs infrequently and can usually be punished under existing laws. We are being asked to undermine the foundation of our democracy in order to squash a gnat. We might be forgiven for focusing on this small problem if we were not inundated with great ones. If the Senate wants to improve our Nation, why don't we turn today to legislation that would reduce the vast numbers of children who go to bed hungry each night? If the Senate wants to prevent despicable behavior, why don't we hold comprehensive hearings on the billions of tax dollars that have been stolen and squandered by companies hired to rebuild Iraq? If the Senate wants to keep faith with our veterans, why don't we leave the Constitution alone and work to improve our VA hospitals? The inescapable answer is that our Republican leaders' priorities are being driven by election year politics. But this is even more than a case of misplaced priorities. It is playing politics with our most fundamental freedom. Doing so opens up a Pandora's box, and if our cherished Bill of Rights is further diluted by future generations, that loss of liberty will trace its heritage to this Senate. Let me end with the words of our national anthem, the ``Star Spangled Banner''. As every schoolchild knows, the first stanza ends with these words: This amendment may protect our star spangled banner, but that flag will wave over a land that is a little less free and a little less brave. I urge this Senate to find the courage to leave the Bill of Rights intact. I yield the remainder of my time.","word.count":540,"sep11":4.91573033707865,"years":2006.77528089888,"days":4192,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.017741436692476,"Topic 2":0.3650045238313,"Topic 3":0.0051196349033332,"Topic 4":0.00462176158108636,"Topic 5":0.00347608082842863,"Topic 6":0.539934472985379,"Topic 7":0.0138265916973581,"Topic 8":0.00715438466395771,"Topic 9":0.0415177373588046,"Topic 10":0.00160337545787597},{"id":"10419960046952","body":"Daniel Patrick Moynihan: I wish to join my esteemed chairman, the Senator from Delaware, in stating that, indeed, this legislation is necessary.

It talks about allowing us to proceed in dealing with them in terms of suppressing terrorism. That effort is very much in our country's interest. Two things I think are worth emphasizing. This amendment does not in any way deliver the disputed arms that are subject to debate and which I hope to offer at a different time. It does not in any way repeal the Pressler amendment, and its restrictions on military sales continue on. But it does in the economic area try and allow discourse between the countries that we think is important. OPIC is allowed to operate, suppression of narcotics is allowed to operate in our cooperative programs, efforts to suppress terrorism are allowed to operate with those programs. This was considered in depth by the Foreign Relations Committee. It was passed out on a vote I believe of 16 to 2. Mr. President, I want to simply add one other thing. We have a dispute with Pakistan. It is based on very sincere and important grounds. But it is also important that we have a way of continuing relations with that country. They are a country that has stood by the United States through thick and thin. They were there when it counted for us. Some may remember when Francis Gary Powers flew his observation missions over the Soviet Union. It was from Pakistan that his plane took off. Some may remember that the United States, when it sought to build SEATO, found one of its first members in Pakistan at a time when other countries in the region were lucky to align themselves with the United States. Some may remember the pivotal war in Afghanistan that preceded the fall of the Soviet Empire. Pakistan put themselves and their country on the line for us when that came about. Time after time after time, when the United States has sought help from Pakistan, they have been there to work with us. When we asked for troops to cooperate in Somalia, it was Pakistan who came forward and sent their troops and, incidentally, suffered large casualties. When we talked about troops in Bosnia, they came forward. When we talked about troops in Haiti where there were not a lot of volunteers, Pakistan came forward. I mention all these things, Mr. President, because while there is a dispute and a legitimate dispute about whether or not those arms should be delivered, there should not be a dispute that is to our advantage to have some discourse with Pakistan. There should not be a dispute that they have been good friends through difficult times. All Members may remember the threats that the leaders of the Soviet Union issued against Pakistan, and yet they stood firm by this country throughout the cold war. So, Mr. President, this is a very small step. It only deals with economic matters, basically, but it is important, I think, as a step of moving toward developing a continuing relationship with one of America's oldest and dearest friends. I might mention at this point the words of President Clinton as he shared them with the Prime Minister of Pakistan. President Clinton said: The President is referring to the payment of $1.4 billion and not getting the equipment and not getting their money back. That is now resolved by this amendment. But to let this moment pass without any effort to extend our hand in friendship to Pakistan, without any effort to recognize that this is a relationship that we should not throw away, I think, would be a mistake. Mr. President, I yield the floor.","word.count":616,"sep11":-6.26404494382022,"years":1995.59550561798,"days":212,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.531250397027255,"Topic 2":0.0638911153753898,"Topic 3":0.267561615672033,"Topic 4":0.0285488634566885,"Topic 5":0.0244055510038144,"Topic 6":0.0140024317392239,"Topic 7":0.00817876073765177,"Topic 8":0.0439604787940606,"Topic 9":0.0106501513329062,"Topic 10":0.00755063486097667},{"id":"10620000013101","body":"Dick Armey: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to announce that the House has completed its legislative business for the week.

Few people can match his record of achievements: I have been privileged to know and work with Senator Thurmond for nearly 40 years. I wish to thank him for his wealth of wisdom. I will always cherish his friendship. But Senator Thurmond is not only my colleague and friend, he is also my brother-in-arms. During World War II, anti-tank gunners from my regiment, the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, assaulted southern France in 1944. Like Senator Thurmond, they went into battle aboard gliders without armor. Glider-borne assaults were extremely dangerous and risky; some would even say they were suicidal missions. However, they were a necessary component of the United States' invasion and liberation of Nazi-occupied France. Senator Thurmond demonstrated rare courage, patriotism, and leadership as gliderman of the 82nd Airborne Division. Most glider descents were ``controlled crashes,'' and that was the case when Senator Thurmond's glider landed in Normandy. Although he was injured, he managed to safely lead his men to the 82nd Airborne Division headquarters at daybreak. The 82nd went on to accomplish its difficult objective of seizing and securing key positions in enemy territory. I am pleased to report that Senator Thurmond's distinguished military service will be honored with the naming of a new section of the Airborne and Special Operations Museum in Fayetteville, NC. The Thurmond Wing will house an exhibit dedicated to the courageous combat gliderman of World War II. As a Senator, Strom Thurmond has often taken positions that were not universally supported.

At the end of our service in the Congress, we, his fellow Senate Members, can only hope that we will be able to say we have served our people with the diligence and devotion that Senator Thurmond has served his people. Indeed, Senator Thurmond can leave this Chamber and say, with confidence and without hesitation, that he has faithfully served the people of South Carolina.","word.count":358,"sep11":1.06741573033708,"years":2002.92696629213,"days":2822,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.121697747652357,"Topic 2":0.0931753801185993,"Topic 3":0.00269092046557611,"Topic 4":0.018609180875179,"Topic 5":0.00231108173659878,"Topic 6":0.00253210874599332,"Topic 7":0.549648840406595,"Topic 8":0.00628831372668683,"Topic 9":0.201195302448849,"Topic 10":0.00185112382356545},{"id":"10720010040462","body":"Orrin Hatch: Mr. President, for the Committee on Armed Services I report favorably the following nomination lists which were printed in the Records on the dates indicated, and ask unanimous consent, to save the expense of reprinting on the Executive Calendar that these nominations lie at the Secretary's desk for the information of Senators.","word.count":1022,"sep11":-0.51123595505618,"years":2001.34831460674,"days":2260,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.122865120884057,"Topic 2":0.146570365419641,"Topic 3":0.0107666212073342,"Topic 4":0.424664674658835,"Topic 5":0.00870331869460493,"Topic 6":0.0253367076118524,"Topic 7":0.00542637702854192,"Topic 8":0.0712849613921746,"Topic 9":0.0158002115133705,"Topic 10":0.168581641589588},{"id":"10720020059807","body":"Robert Bennett: Mr. President, I have been here for an hour and a half now listening to this debate, listening to the argument going back and forth, and the conclusion I think I hear from the Senator from Louisiana and the Senator from Connecticut is an interesting one. It may not be the conclusion they really think they came to, but the conclusion I hear them saying, particularly in the final statements that took place, is they put this in the amendment to give the labor unions a sense of security but, in fact, that security is not there, so we can vote for the amendment with a clear conscience; that they did what the unions wanted them to do so they would not feel nervous about being put into this new Department, but reading their interpretation of the law, they are saying it really does not make any difference. The last comment from the Senator from Connecticut that even an arbitrary and capricious action by a President--and he made it clear he did not expect this President to do that, and I appreciate his graciousness in that, but then in a hypothetical, an arbitrary or capricious action by a President could still go unchecked under this amendment and, therefore, we ought to embrace it. If that is, in fact, the case--I will look at it very closely with some help from people who are burdened with a legal education, as I am not--if that is, in fact, the case, I think the Senator from Connecticut has just exposed himself to a little criticism from the unions. How can he have misled them into thinking he was doing something substantive on their behalf and at their behest if, in fact, it is not substantive and the President would get everything he wants? Of course, the same question arises from the White House. If, in fact, the White House is seeing no substantive change and this is more of a cosmetic kind of a thing, why are they threatening to veto? So I am now going to leave the floor and go to lunch. I have some time scheduled later in the afternoon when I will talk about something else, but I have found this to be a very interesting exchange. Without in any way attempting to diminish the sincerity, integrity, or intelligence of those who have engaged in the debate on both sides, it strikes me a little like the medieval debate about the number of angels who can dance on the head of a pin.

If we are really concerned about lowering energy costs and reducing dependence on foreign oil, we need to invest in renewable resources, and we have passed legislation to do just that. The open rule before us today is a fair rule that allows for debate on the important issues that face our country, from water pollutants to public health concerns. It is Congress' responsibility to set high standards and assert proper oversight of these issues.

Congress has a distinct obligation to future generations to keep our water clean and preserve our beaches.

Dicks: Mr. Chairman, I take back my time. The gentleman knows fully if they have a species on their property, it is their responsibility. They do not have to do it, but if they do not do it, they do not get an incidental take permit. If they want to risk taking a species without an incidental take permit, then they will violate the Endangered Species Act. The way to do it is to go in and enter into an agreement. Now, in many cases, small landowners are given, as a matter of course, an incidental take permit. It is the large landowner that is asked to do the multispecies HCP. In this case, the company involved did not negotiate in good faith to get a multispecies HCP. If they had done that and they were willing to do that on all the lands that they own in this area that the gentleman's amendment affects, I am told by the Fish and Wildlife Service that they would have bent over backwards to try to enter into such an agreement. The facts are that they came in and made it very clear from the very first instant that what they wanted to do was to file a lawsuit that would raise the issue of a constitutional taking. That is, in fact, what they did. And in fact the Federal judge, Judge Rothstein, is the one who directed the Fish and Wildlife Service to designate critical habitat. In this instance, 78 percent of the critical habitat was on Federal lands, and only 1 percent was on the private lands. In my judgment, the only reason it is on the private land is because the area involved is crucial to the survival of the spotted owl in that area. So I would just say to the gentleman from California, not only in this amendment is he undermining the Endangered Species Act, he is also threatening the survival of the marbled murrelet. There are a lot of fishermen who have written me saying, please oppose the Riggs amendment. They are fearful that, if we do not protect the marbled murrelet and it becomes endangered rather than threatened under the Federal law, even more onerous restrictions will be put on the fishermen in my colleague's area as well. Now, I sympathize with the gentleman from California. He and I have worked on things together in the past, but what I do not like here is what he is doing. By coming in here and getting a specific exemption, it is undermining all of the rest of us who are trying to get our private companies to do the right thing by entering into a multispecies HCP.

I want to acknowledge the leadership of the senior Senator from Virginia, Senator John Warner, Chairman of the Armed Services Committee in bringing this bill to final passage. Of course, I must also recognize the ranking member, Senator Carl Levin. I had the privilege of working with them on the Committee for several years and I can attest that each year they work together tirelessly to pass the defense authorization bill because they understand how absolutely vital this legislation is to the effectiveness and well-being of our armed forces. For that matter, let me also recognize every Senator on the committee for their efforts because this conference report authorizes the equipment, the training, and the operational funds necessary to support our troops who are right now operating across the globe to make our Nation and the world more secure. It also reflects the service and sacrifice of our troops by making a solid investment in their quality of life by increasing their pay and enhancing educational and health care opportunities for our active duty military members, our National Guard and Reserve troops and their family members. And that is only right, for today we are asking a great deal of our gallant young men and women as they guard our Nation at home and abroad and, of course, risk their lives every day to restore freedom and prosperity to the oppressed peoples of Iraq and Afghanistan. This legislation also recognizes that we owe a continuing debt to those who have served honorably by phasing-in for those with a service connected disability rated at 50 percent or more the same benefit available to every other retired Federal employee--the ability to collect full retirement pay and disability entitlements without offsets. There is much work to be done before we achieve the full equity of concurrent receipt for all disabled military retirees and I will continue to support these efforts until we finally achieve the goal of full concurrent receipt. This $401.3 billion dollar authorization provides $74.3 billion for the critical procurement accounts. In particular, this bill makes some significant strides by providing almost $12 billion in an area that is critical to the security of the Nation--our shipbuilding capacity. It has become more and more apparent that as we engage the forces of terrorism around the world we have become increasingly dependent on the ability of our Navy to not only deliver troops and munitions to the fight, but to act as the sea base from which our forces can operate without restrictions virtually anywhere in the world. Yet, as a former Chair of the Seapower Subcommittee, I remain concerned about the Navy's shipbuilding program, particularly with respect to the surface combatant force. As part of the 2001 Quadrennial Defense Review, the Navy and DoD approved a plan for maintaining a 310- ship Navy including 116 surface combatants--cruisers, destroyers and frigates. Partly because of continuing concerns about the Navy's uncertainty regarding plans for future surface combatants, last year's authorization directed that the Navy notify Congress should the number of active and reserve surface combatant ships drop below 116 and provide an operational risk assessment based on that number. By the end of fiscal year 2003, the Navy's surface combatant fleet had fallen to 106 ships and in the latest report submitted by the Navy in June of this year, the Navy notified Congress that by the end of fiscal year 2004, it was their intent to reduce the force of surface combatants to 103 ships. According to the Navy, accelerating the decommissioning of Ticonderoga- and Spruance-class ships will free up funds for next-generation destroyer programs without appreciably raising the operational risk level to our Naval forces because they are ``significantly less capable than the more modern and survivable AEGIS- equipped DDG-51 class ships that are replacing them.'' Therefore, I am encouraged that this authorization provides $3.2 billion for the construction of three DDG-51 Arleigh-Burke class destroyers for it is these ships, along with cruisers and frigates, that provide protection to the carriers and amphibious ships deployed to the Persian Gulf and around the world to prosecute the war on terrorism. Moreover, it adds $20 million for the DDG Modernization program to begin the insertion of advanced technologies that will dramatically reduce operation and support costs to the fleet and mitigate the risk of back-fitting these technologies on older ships. Above all, we must pursue every path necessary to provide technologies to our sailors that will ease their workload, enhance their training opportunities and increase the survivability of their ships. In 2005, the Navy will complete the DDG-51 acquisition program, and the next generation of surface combatants, the DD and the Littoral Combat Ship are being funded in the research and development accounts. Although this authorization provides $1 billion for the continued development of the DD and $183 million for the continued development of the LCS in the RDT&amp;E accounts, there is a looming gap in the Shipbuilding and Conversion, Navy account for surface combatants. Without a focused effort on the part of the Navy to commit and invest in a robust surface combatant program, I am concerned not only about the ability of the Navy's surface combatant force to maintain current operating tempos but the continuing viability of our shipbuilding industrial base. This trend not only applies to surface combatants but to our attack submarine fleet as well. Although the Navy and the Department of Defense has established a requirement of 55 attack submarines, the current inventory numbers only 54 of those ships. To compound the problem, the Navy continues to place submarines such as the USS Jacksonville on the list of submarines to be inactivated rather than funding their refueling as a solution to this force structure gap. The Senate wisely added $248 million for the refueling of that submarine and I am pleased this report sustained that effort. I am also disappointed that the conferees have included Section 319 in this bill, on Military Readiness and Marine Mammal Protection. Under the Senate Rules, the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation has jurisdiction over issues relating to marine mammals, including authorizations for and oversight of the Marine Mammal Protection Act . The Subcommittee on Oceans, Fisheries, and Coast Guard, which I chair, intends to work on reauthorizing the MMPA in its entirety this Congress, and we have held a hearing and numerous briefings with all concerned marine mammal interests, including the Navy and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. By including Section 319 in this bill, the conferees have disregarded our jurisdiction and work on the reauthorization of the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and they have seriously altered marine mammal policy in the United States. I have serious concerns about their changes to the definition of harassment, the Department of Defense exemption from the MMPA, and the incidental takings language. Changes of this magnitude on behalf of the military requires oversight and review by the Commerce Committee, and the implications of these changes for other regulated parties and interested MMPA stakeholders must be fully understood. Our Subcommittee will address these changes and many other marine mammal conservation issues as we proceed with full, comprehensive reauthorization of the MMPA. Importantly, this bill sets aside $63.4 billion in the research and development accounts to develop the advanced technologies our troops will use to maintain their technological superiority over their adversaries. Significantly, conferees authorized $11 billion for the critical science and technology programs which brings us close to the goal of setting aside 3 percent of the defense budget to invest in the ``seed corn'' of our future military capability. Much of that S&amp;T investment will be executed at universities and colleges throughout America. For example, the University of Maine system has been on the forefront of the development of chemical and biological sensors and decontamination systems. The bill provides them with $1 million this year to begin the development of an environmentally-friendly photo-catalytic decontamination agent that holds much promise for the safe and rapid decontamination of exposed personnel as well as for the remediation of chemical agent and manufacturing and storage facilities. In addition, this bill also authorizes $4 million for continued research at the University of Maine into the structural reliability of fiber-reinforced polymers composites in ship assemblies that will help define and ultimately control the significant property variations found in composite plates used in Navy ship construction. One of the hallmarks of the Department of Defense is the interwoven nature of the military and civilian personnel who work together as our national security team. Civilian workers at DOD work alongside their military counterparts every single day, sometimes in the most hazardous conditions. For example, at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, ME, workers hold a memorial service every year for the gallant crew of the USS Thresher, lost at sea in April, 1963 with 112 sailors and 17 fellow civilian workers from the shipyard. The civilian workers at the Department of Defense work and sacrifice to keep this Nation secure and we should recognize their dedication and professionalism. While there are many positive provisions included in the bill, I am disappointed that the conferees did not include all of the personnel reform provisions put forward by my colleagues, Senators Collins, Levin, Sununu and Voinovich, instead adopting many of the provisions p","word.count":1988,"sep11":2.2247191011236,"years":2004.08426966292,"days":3234,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.110708601492241,"Topic 2":0.17960696741939,"Topic 3":0.00671873650202609,"Topic 4":0.11645264694039,"Topic 5":0.0053651266577779,"Topic 6":0.00433614790706895,"Topic 7":0.0124946256569374,"Topic 8":0.0107985597579298,"Topic 9":0.547176984796031,"Topic 10":0.00634160287020757},{"id":"11020070024914","body":"Diana DeGette: Well, there are new standards, of course","word.count":581,"sep11":5.88483146067416,"years":2007.74438202247,"days":4537,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0839435345004398,"Topic 2":0.0179169928422325,"Topic 3":0.255585841975185,"Topic 4":0.0166088407947015,"Topic 5":0.050014032355301,"Topic 6":0.0631428369091943,"Topic 7":0.00329497926648565,"Topic 8":0.166726033674526,"Topic 9":0.00767333839808712,"Topic 10":0.335093569283848},{"id":"10419960041497","body":"Robert K.

The merchant marines have served this country since the birth of our Nation. Many people do not think of that. They are most frequently remembered as the World War II veterans because of the great significance they played in that conflict. However, beginning as early as 1775, the merchant marine was actually the first military force we used to defeat the British Navy with. During that time period, they became our first Navy: merchant vessels with guns on them. They brought critical supplies to fight for our independence. If we go on to the next century in the 1800s, between 1812, the War of 1812, and the first World War, they participated in not only that War of 1812, but also the Civil War, the Spanish American War, and delivered doughboys to Europe and their supplies to go with them. In 1936, the Merchant Marine Act was passed by Congress which established the United States merchant marine ``as a naval or military auxiliary in time of war or national emergency.'' From 1941 to 1946, during World War II, merchant marines took part in all invasions. Merchant marine casualties were the highest in any service: 1 in 29. One in 29 people that served became a casualty. Statistics were so important in keeping track of the losses that during World War II we kept secret merchant marine losses because in some weeks we were losing over 30 vessels a week being sunk, between ours and allied forces around the world, and we would never be able to report that and still have men sign up to be a merchant seaman. By 1946, allied leaders planning the invasions of Japan had the merchant marine assigned a critical role in order to move millions of men and their material. Again, the merchant marine after the war, World War II, came out in the Korean War and they supported that operation. They supported the Vietnam War in 1961 to 1973; and today they serve, even today, supplying troops in Bosnia as well as our earlier conflicts in the 1990s, the Persian Gulf War. Merchant marines provide a service which is critical to every war effort. To tell my colleagues how critical it is, in World War II, the average soldier, depending upon his job, required somewhere between seven and 15 tons of material to supply them for 1 year. One soldier for 1 year, seven to 15 tons. That does not get delivered by airplanes; it gets delivered by ships all over the world. In fact, on average, in 1945, every hour there were 17 million pounds of cargo being delivered by the merchant marine in support of our war effort. In 1965, skipping ahead now to Vietnam, we had 300 freighters and tankers supplying the United States military efforts, and on average, on average, we had 75 ships and over 3,000 merchant mariners in Vietnamese ports at any given time. Da Nang Harbor was the home of the Marine Amphibious Force Logistic Command, and in support of 81,000 Marines in Vietnam, that command brought 96 percent of the war material needed for the Marine forces there. That included everything from tanks to food. Merchant marines have served as civilians, but routinely go in harm's way in the conduct of their service. Here I am going to quote from B.D. Hammer in an article he wrote in the New York Daily News on May 20, talking about war heroes in the merchant marines: Again, one in 29 mariners who served aboard merchant ships in World War II died in the line of duty. Some of those casualties: There were 8,651 mariners killed in World War II, U.S. mariners. One hundred forty-two of those were cadets from the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. They were college kids. We all nominate people to the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, and that academy is the only service academy, of the five that we have, that is authorized to carry a battle standard. They sent cadets to go fight the war. We had 11,000 wounded, 1,100 more died of wounds ashore, and 604 men and women were taken prisoner while serving as merchant marines. Sixty of them died in prison camp. We have about 500 more Americans who died in service while serving on allied vessels, 500 more. We had people die in the Vietnam War serving in the merchant marine, and many more injured due to actions around them. As a nation, we must remain committed to maintaining a strong merchant marine. It is the greatest insurance we will have that we will always be able to deliver our men and materiel wherever in the world they are needed. We need a strong Merchant Marine Academy to train them, we need a strong shipbuilding industry to build their vessels, and we need to recognize the service of those who gave their lives in times of war. The merchant marines have been part of America's history since we became a nation. They are most frequently remembered for World War II action because of the publicity of that event. Today, we have a few remaining even from that war, and we should seek even more recognition as they gradually pass on. I urge the passage of this resolution, Mr. Speaker, and I reserve the balance of my time.","word.count":898,"sep11":-1.02247191011236,"years":2000.83707865169,"days":2078,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.105102390797777,"Topic 2":0.0125009661513613,"Topic 3":0.015603224193988,"Topic 4":0.00650504650705665,"Topic 5":0.00312289466700285,"Topic 6":0.754771597808277,"Topic 7":0.0042618679890144,"Topic 8":0.0430143619655983,"Topic 9":0.0526351379376335,"Topic 10":0.0024825119822912},{"id":"11020080001686","body":"Alcee L. Hastings: Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my full support for H. Res. 942, a resolution that recognizes Black History Month as a time to acknowledge the many contributions that African Americans have made in our Nation's history and as a time for all Americans to fully understand the events and struggles that shaped our great Nation. When Aristotle said, ``If you would understand anything, observe its beginning and its development,'' he suggested that we cannot fully know what something is if we do not know its past. This certainly holds true for our country. Knowing our Nation's history does more than tell us who we were; it tells us who we are. And if we look honestly at our past successes and mistakes, it tells us what we can become. Unfortunately, the long practice of omitting, abbreviating, and misrepresenting African Americans in American history has resulted in an incomplete and skewed story of our country's history. Fortunately, the social change of the civil rights movement inspired a change in the way that America told and understood its history. It became clear that American history--like America's schools and lunch counters--needed to be integrated. Over the years, Black History Month has become a chance to realize our rich diversity by studying the artistic, scientific, and political contributions that African Americans have made to the United States and the rest of the world. Realize Black history is American history, and February should not be the only time that we acknowledge the contributions of African American men, women, and children in U.S. history. African Americans have played a key role in just about every single moment in American history, and it is high time that our history books reflect that. Driven by my commitment to the human and civil rights of all, I have worked hard to ensure that all people--regardless of their nationality, sexual orientation, gender, or race--have access to their most basic rights. My experiences in and before I came to this body have taught me that all people have influenced our country's greatness. It is critically important that these contributions are acknowledged and retold. Mr. Speaker, as we observe and celebrate the contributions of African Americans in America we must not forget that we are making history as we speak. We are living in an historical era in which extraordinary people from all walks of life are seeking opportunities that were previously not available to them. Outstanding Americans such as Barrington Irving, the youngest and first person of African descent to fly around the world, teach us that we can achieve great things in this land of opportunity as long as we have the will and drive. As we all know, for the first time in history, the two contending candidates for the Democratic nominee for President are a black man and a woman. As we reflect on the numerous contributions and experiences of African Americans in this country, we must be cognizant of how we as a modern multi-ethnic and multicultural nation deal with the issues of our time. How we do this will determine how future generations will view us in the history books. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this important resolution.","word.count":537,"sep11":6.57022471910112,"years":2008.4297752809,"days":4781,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.164199828810648,"Topic 2":0.420950118830569,"Topic 3":0.0113164177207581,"Topic 4":0.00857892105602761,"Topic 5":0.253964669719357,"Topic 6":0.00596930862077291,"Topic 7":0.0278034792654265,"Topic 8":0.0150687499031333,"Topic 9":0.0717524229838372,"Topic 10":0.0203960830894702},{"id":"11020070097107","body":"Mary Landrieu: Mr. President, I appreciate all of Chairman Harkin's efforts in bringing this bill forward and thank him for his continued support of the Nation's public schools, including charter schools, which increase the academic achievement of our Nation's most low-income students. Unfortunately, the committee did not provide enough funding for public charter schools. Charter schools are public schools created by teachers, parents, and other community stakeholders to educate students of all backgrounds and educational abilities. In exchange for greater accountability for student achievement, these schools are free from many local and State regulations. This flexibility and accountability has allowed individuals with nontraditional backgrounds to create cultures that have made charter schools top academic performers often in some of the Nation's largest urban centers. Because of this unique approach to education, demand for these schools has been remarkable over the last decade. In New Orleans, charters schools have been an engine of our school systems rebirth. For the 2006-2007 school year almost 60 percent of New Orleans' public schools students were enrolled in charter schools, the largest market share of any city in the country. Charter schools are not a panacea, but they are a tremendously valuable piece of education reform, and we should be cautiously optimistic about their potential to help close the achievement gap. In my State, charter schools have come in and filled the intense need we faced following the hurricanes of 2006. As the chairman knows, I have filed an amendment to restore funds to the Credit Enhancement Program. I understand the chairman is not in a position to be able to support that amendment at this time. Before I withdraw my amendment, I hope that the chairman will commit to support as much funding as possible for Public Charter Schools.","word.count":293,"sep11":6.26966292134831,"years":2008.12921348315,"days":4674,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.109131461686922,"Topic 2":0.397745716255599,"Topic 3":0.0648679146198721,"Topic 4":0.124013842605517,"Topic 5":0.0830195731199363,"Topic 6":0.0250857059731848,"Topic 7":0.0104100229368154,"Topic 8":0.0142952718915102,"Topic 9":0.155369387978911,"Topic 10":0.0160611029317314},{"id":"10419960080001","body":"Trent Lott: I believe that would do it Mr. President, I thank the Democratic leader for the suggestion in trying to put that in motion here.

Dorgan: Madam President, this afternoon the Republicans have held an issues conference; in fact, I believe for most of the day. As a result, they have not been here today to engage in discussion on the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. I just finished speaking with Senator Murkowski, vice chairman of the committee. We talked about the bill. She has played a significant role as vice chairman in bringing this Indian health care improvement bill to the floor. We both would like those who have amendments to provide notice to us of their amendments. Our cloakrooms have asked for a list of amendments so that we may process them. It appears, based on what the majority leader indicated, that we will at some point today, perhaps in the next hour or two, turn to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The reason for that is, there is a deadline of February 1 by which that Act has to be renewed. It expires and we have to take action to renew it. It will be controversial and cause quite a debate. So what the majority leader has indicated is that he will turn to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and we will be on that tonight, tomorrow, perhaps Friday and Saturday--who knows?--and that following completion of that, he will bring the Indian health care improvement bill back to the floor. My appreciation to the majority leader, he is trying to balance some difficult things. He, for the first time in 10 years, decided we should do what we should have done in the last 10 years, and that is reauthorize Indian health care. We have a scandal in Indian health care with full scale rationing. Only 40 percent of health care needs are being met. We have people dying today on reservations because health care that we take for granted for our families, many of us, is not being made available on Indian reservations. I thank Senator Reid for allowing us to come to the floor and putting this in the schedule. When it is pulled from the floor to go to FISA, it will be brought back next week or when FISA is completed. I appreciate that. I notice my colleague from South Dakota, Mr. Johnson, is here. Senator Johnson and I share the Standing Rock Sioux Indian reservation that straddles our boundary of North and South Dakota. It is a large reservation. Both of us have been there many times. South Dakota has a number of other Indian reservations. Senator Johnson, as a member of the committee, has done superb work with us to put this legislation together. I appreciate his help and his attention to what is an urgent priority for American Indians, to get the health care this country long ago promised. We wrote it in treaties. We have a trust responsibility. That responsibility is affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States. Yet we have had broken promises and broken treaties. At long last we must affirm our responsibility to say to Native Americans: It is our responsibility. We assumed that responsibility to provide decent and good health care, health care we can be proud of for Native Americans. That is what this discussion is about. Because I have seen my colleague from South Dakota come into the Chamber, I did want to say a special thanks to him. I know my colleague, Senator Murkowski, and other Republicans and Democrats on the committee worked hard. We all worked together--it was bipartisan-- in getting this bill to the floor. Senator Johnson, over a long period of time, has worked to make this day happen. Let me thank him for his great work.","word.count":614,"sep11":6.53089887640449,"years":2008.3904494382,"days":4767,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.746514949327888,"Topic 2":0.0844070894213397,"Topic 3":0.0183637780457605,"Topic 4":0.0390154274246367,"Topic 5":0.0187238754093806,"Topic 6":0.0175150798849644,"Topic 7":0.0146157205104219,"Topic 8":0.0319025652509988,"Topic 9":0.0203689196321107,"Topic 10":0.00857259509249872},{"id":"10720020010618","body":"David Obey: Mr. Chairman, evidently what we have going on here is that we not only have faux legislation, we now also have faux debate.

Bill began his career with the Office of the Architect of the Capitol as a personnel clerk in February 1956. He steadily advanced in various jobs and in October, 1973, was appointed to the position of administrative assistant to George M. White, the Architect of the Capitol. As the Architect's administrative assistant, Bill was the management official responsible for that office's human resources, accounting, and procurement divisions and the flag office, and for oversight of the operations of the Senate Restaurants. He also served as the coordinator of the superintendents and supervising engineers of the various buildings under the Architect's jurisdiction, as well as the Capitol grounds. In addition to these duties, Bill acted as adviser and counselor to the Architect and, in effect, served as Mr. White's chief of staff. Bill was born in Henderson, NC, and attended Henderson High School. He completed his studies at Henderson Business College in July 1955. Prior to his employment with the Architect's Office, Bill worked for Southeastern Construction Co. and Harriet Cotton Mills. He served with the U.S. Coast Guard from February 1952, to August 1954.

Clay Shaw, Mike Bilirakis, Jim Davis, and Katherine Harris have all served our great state and our great Nation with passion and with pride. They have all left their own individual mark on this House as an institution, and I know they will be missed by all of our colleagues. Mike Bilirakis was my immediate neighbor as he represents the Ninth Congressional District of Florida just to my north. There is no member more beloved by his constituents than Mike Bilirakis as they respect him as a man of character and integrity. Mike was not a member who scheduled press conferences or spoke often on the House floor. He did his work behind the scenes and was tenacious when seeing matters through to their conclusion. You only need to look at his efforts to provide concurrent receipt payments for our Nation's veterans who retired from military service with a disability. After more than a decade, his legislation was signed into law to solve this terrible inequity for so many veterans. Likewise, he fought tirelessly for veterans with spinal cord injuries to expand the spinal cord treatment unit at the Haley VA Hospital. This is how he worked on the many other issues that were of special interest to him including health care, Medicare, seniors issues, or medical research. He took his work as Chairman of the Veterans Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations and the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health seriously and spent considerable time on the many legislative matters that fell within their jurisdiction. Mr. Speaker, Mike Bilirakis is a patriot and statesman and we will miss the quiet grace with which he and his wife Evelyn served the people of Florida. For me, I will especially miss him as a friend and confidant. They are a special couple who I wish all the best in their retirement years. And I know it is with great pride that they will watch as their son Gus is sworn-in next month to establish a new legacy of service in this House. Mr. Speaker, I also rise to pay tribute to Clay Shaw, the Chairman of our Florida delegation. He has done outstanding work over the past few years in keeping the 25 members of our delegation communicating and focusing on the needs of our large and growing state. Clay also has a distinguished record of legislative success in this House. He chaired three Subcommittees of the Ways and Means Committee, leaving behind an indelible stamp of success in many divergent areas. It was under his chairmanship that we passed and enacted sweeping welfare reform. He was a voice of reason as chairman of the Social Security Subcommittee as the Congress and our Nation has wrestled with the best approach to sure up the financial integrity of the Social Security Trust Funds. And in his latest assignment, he has advanced the issues of global trade and competitiveness as chairman of the Trade Subcommittee. He has also been an unquestioned champion for our environment as he has been a leader in the restoration of the Everglades, the renourishment of Florida's beautiful beaches, and in fighting to prevent drilling for oil off Florida's coastline. Mr. Speaker, in addition to his legislative successes, Clay is also a personal inspiration as he and Emilie have worked together to represent our Nation, our state, and the 22nd district of Florida with great energy and integrity. Even two battles with lung cancer never slowed Clay's drive to serve in this House as he never missed a step. Our colleagues from Florida, those who served with him on the Ways and Means Committee, and all those who have come to know him over the past 26 years will miss Clay and his easygoing yet thoughtful manner. Mr. Speaker, Katherine Harris is one of our delegation's most junior members but quickly established herself as one of the hardest working members of this House. She has devoted her career to public service, having been elected to serve Florida as a State Senator, Secretary of State, and member of the House for the past four years representing the people of the 13th Congressional District. Among her many legislative accomplishments in that short period of time were bills to create more affordable housing opportunities, to provide funding for a veterans cemetery in Sarasota, to restore equity in disability payments for veterans, and to spur free trade. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Katherine for her service here and to wish her all the best in her future endeavors. Finally, Mr. Speaker, I want to pay tribute to Jim Davis, my colleague from the 11th District of Florida whom I share the City of St. Petersburg with and who has proudly represented the people of the Tampa Bay area for 10 years. From his first days in office, Jim has always kept his focus on fiscal responsibility through his work on the Budget Committee. He also established himself as a leader on education issues, particularly in the recruitment in response to severe shortages in Florida and throughout the Nation. As much as I will remember Jim for his legislative work, I will always remember the care with which he balanced his work here with his passion to spend time with his wife Peggy and their sons Peter and William. Jim found a way to manage the hectic schedule of the House with the need to be with his young sons as they have grown during his five terms here. Mr. Speaker, the Florida Congressional Delegation has always worked well together in the best interests of the people of Florida. We may have had differences of opinion on national legislation, but we put those differences aside to work on Florida issues. With the departure of Clay Shaw, Mike Bilirakis, Katherine Harris, and Jim Davis, we lose four Members who have devoted themselves to this House and to our State. We will miss their service and their friendship but we will continue to carry on their commitment to serve with honor and distinction. In closing, I join with all my colleagues who will follow me this evening in wishing each of these Members the very best as they leave the people's House.","word.count":1062,"sep11":5.37078651685393,"years":2007.23033707865,"days":4354,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0245861838668835,"Topic 2":0.0325520543518727,"Topic 3":0.00420455562812318,"Topic 4":0.0251863271210263,"Topic 5":0.00248564163988352,"Topic 6":0.0146272034700465,"Topic 7":0.877420847358925,"Topic 8":0.00660140323055971,"Topic 9":0.0110089462864593,"Topic 10":0.00132683704622096},{"id":"10419950046174","body":"Michael D.

It is both reasonable and necessary. At its essence, our debate is about the critical need to ensure Saddam Hussein fully understands our resolve to protect our citizens and to promote peace around the world. There is no question we would all prefer it if the path ahead did not include military action. Unfortunately, Saddam Hussein may not allow us that option. The President and other members of his administration have provided a sober, convincing picture of the threats our nation faces from Iraq's current regime. As the President said earlier this week, ``While there are many dangers in the world, the threat from Iraq stands alone because it gathers the most serious dangers of our age in one place.'' And this ``one place'' is led by an evil, evil dictator who directs his intense hatred toward America, Americans, our interests and our allies. Iraq's leadership has continued to aggressively pursue the development of weapons of mass destruction to add to his arsenal. We've all talked about these weapons but it's worth spelling out what they can be: chemical weapons, biological weapons and even nuclear weapons. Saddam Hussein has shown his cruel willingness to use such devastating weapons against his own citizens and his neighboring countries in the past. I sincerely doubt he's had a change of heart. We must also not ignore the support of terrorism found in Hussein's Iraq. September 11, 2001 was a horrific reminder that terrorists are serious in their intent to harm Americans. This step is a continuation of the war against terrorism that our nation has been forced to undertake. It is Saddam Hussein himself who provides the final proof that we must act. He has a robust history of disregard of the international community and its laws. Time and again, he has willingly and defied the United Nations and the world community by ignoring the agreements he has made. He has constructed a wall of delay and deception that at times is as thick as the cloud of black smoke from the malicious oil fires that greeted our troops in 1991 as they liberated Kuwait. It's obvious that Iraq's current regime presents problems not just for the United States, but problems for international peace and stability. We can not deny the seriousness of the situation, and I believe America should provide its leadership for the sake of peace and justice. The President has earned our confidence through his leadership since last fall's terrorist attacks. The President is determined to pursue a course of action with regard to Iraq that will both ensure our own nation's security and promote international stability and I support his efforts. At the same time, I want to make it clear that I respect those who have sincere opposing views on the question before us. The freedom to disagree is one among many freedoms that we are vigorously trying to preserve and I would never want that to change. Few in Iraq who disagree with Saddam Hussein can share their opinions openly. The resolution we are considering makes it clear that America prefers to find solutions together with the United Nations and other international leaders. It also provides authority for the President to use force if diplomatic or other peaceful means are not effective. It preserves America's right to act on its own as we must in self-defense of our nation's interests. Mr. Speaker, the first major vote I took as a Member of Congress in 1991 was to support the international coalition's effort to liberate Kuwait from Iraqi aggressors. No one wanted war then, but it was necessary. No one wants war now. We don't seek it. It is my fervent hope that war with Iraq may yet be avoided. And it may. But our shared and firm commitment to the security of our nation should not be questioned by Saddam Hussein or the world community.","word.count":139,"sep11":0.098314606741573,"years":2001.95786516854,"days":2477,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.05626221537656,"Topic 2":0.393554017794674,"Topic 3":0.238325428834838,"Topic 4":0.0269502105336677,"Topic 5":0.0438716093234558,"Topic 6":0.0241342873975558,"Topic 7":0.108739624671706,"Topic 8":0.065511271561432,"Topic 9":0.0282672577486416,"Topic 10":0.0143840767574698},{"id":"10720020039910","body":"Harry Reid: Mr. President, we have approximately 2 hours until all time runs out on this legislation as a result of the postcloture rules.

I just say amen to what they have said. Both of them have hit it on the head. Let me add a little, if I may. What is PMI? What is private mortgage insurance? It is a good thing, and I am grateful that the lending institutions have come up with this creative way in which to help people who could not pay at least 20 percent down on their loans. So they get into these things, they buy the house, they are elated, they are given the key to the house, this is a big moment, and they walk in. Then after that goes away after a short time, they start looking at that payment bill that comes in. Anywhere between $20 to $100 they see every month, and say, what am I paying this for? They find that they are paying private mortgage insurance. When we think of insurance, we think of something that we buy to help us. This is not the case in this instance. This is something we buy to take care of the lender in case we do not make our payments. It is an interesting history. I have to admit I did not know too much about it. After my first term I sold my place out in Virginia and bought a little condo across from the Pentagon. I wanted to be close to the House. I noticed that when I got my bill, there was something about private mortgage insurance. I did not even know what it was. I called up the lending institution and said, what is this, anyway? They explained it to me, as it has been explained today. I said, that is all well and good, how do I get rid of it? They said, you send us a check for x amount of dollars and we will take it off. I sent them the check. They did not take it off. I said, why did you not take it off? They said, we do not have to take it off. But if you will have an independent appraisal done on your place, we will be happy to consider it. How much is that? $1,200. Now, the average American paying between $20 to $100 for this, he is not going to see a lawyer, he is not going to fuss, he is going to be mad and hunker down and do it. They did not do it after the appraisal. So I called them up again and they said, we do not have to take it off. Then, just like most people in our business, I started using this speech around America, and lo and behold, half the people in the audience would come up and say, I have this same problem. I have been paying this year after year after year. A couple of attorneys came to see me, one from Alabama. He had a class action going of two or three thousand people who had faithfully made payments on their PMI, and they would not take it off. Then we started getting letters. I have stacks of letters now in my office where people would write in and show me the sarcastic and cavalier way that many of the banks, lending institutions, would come up with, and say, we do not have to take it off. Pay it the rest of your life. That is what has happened, Mr. Speaker. Many people in America have paid it the rest of their lives. It would be interesting some day to see all of the letters we have, such as from a little lady in Texas, one in Nevada, one in Massachusetts, scattered all over America, who have faithfully made their payments on time and are enriching insurance companies, servicers, and lending institutions to the point of millions of dollars which did not have to be paid. This is a piece of consumer legislation which I think is extremely important. I would like to point out that the language as we got it from the Senate says ``single-family dwelling.'' If you go into a homeowner's policy or a policy such as that, that is interpreted to mean a freestanding place and only one family living in it. I think the gentleman from Iowa adequately addressed this, but if someone wants to try this case, I think it comes down to the idea that we mean a single family in a condo, in any other area, a unit which they are buying, so we do not exclude all those particular people. As the gentleman from New York pointed out, this bill will require full disclosure of what PMI is. It will require notification of their right to cancel, and will have some information in the bill about automatic cancellation if they live up to it. I want to thank the members of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, who have worked so diligently on this. I really feel that this is a good piece of legislation. The Senate and the House have worked diligently to do it. In my humble opinion, this is one of the better pieces of consumer legislation we have come up with this in term. I would urge the support of my colleagues in passing this legislation.","word.count":919,"sep11":-3.24438202247191,"years":1998.61516853933,"days":1287,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.62212461878726,"Topic 2":0.247612503849438,"Topic 3":0.00617874128407123,"Topic 4":0.0356782974679265,"Topic 5":0.00665334744722164,"Topic 6":0.0334623730132204,"Topic 7":0.0298925349305003,"Topic 8":0.00861132006308816,"Topic 9":0.00756270304469293,"Topic 10":0.00222356011258135},{"id":"10720010010659","body":"Non-Voting Delegate: Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word Mr. Chairman, last night I stood in this very same room with some of you here to argue against the raising of the debt ceiling and from bankrupting our Social Security system for our current senior citizens and future baby boomers like myself and others. I am dismayed that this afternoon I have to return and make the very same argument again, raising the debt ceiling especially in such a backhanded way that unfairly forces us to make choices, choices of priorities. Make no mistake about it, make no mistake about it, Democrats do support our troops. We do support the war on terrorism; but we cannot sit idly by while the Bush administration and the Republican leadership continue to chip away at the support beams of Social Security in the name of patriotism. I ask, Is it patriotic to steal food and shelter from our seniors? Is it patriotic to force our seniors to choose between nutritious meals and their prescription drugs? Is it patriotic to ask our workers to pay into the Social Security system that may be dissolved before they have an opportunity to benefit from it, like myself? Mr. Speaker, the U.S. House of Representatives has over 61 women Representatives here now. But the United States is comprised of over 140 million women. And of those women, there are many who will be adversely affected by the radical shift in Social Security. Today women represent about 60 percent of the Social Security recipients and 72 percent of those are beneficiaries aged 85 years and over. More than a quarter of these women depend on Social Security as their sole source of income. And just like my district where there are many minority women, Latinas and women of Asian descent, they are at risk. Where are they going to go to help pay for their rent, to get their medicine, to take care of themselves? Because all they have is that check that comes maybe once a month. We cannot play with the lives of these women who have given so much to our country. Many are sole survivors now whose husbands have fought in our wars.

If we, as we did a couple of years ago, pass a bill out of the House here, we sent that over to the Senate. The Senate did not act on it. Let us hope it is different this year as we look over the next few weeks of passing a bill out here and sending it over to the other body, but I do thank him for joining us tonight and thank him for all the work, for all the citizens, not only in the State of Connecticut, but all over the country. Let me just say a few things and close out this evening and remark on this. We said no senior should have to choose between food and medicine, and yet that is happening in this country, and yet we are undoubtedly the wealthiest Nation in the world's history. We have developed a tremendous amount of health care technology, including wonderful new medications, prescription drugs that help prevent disease. We now have medications that prevent hardening of the arteries, that reduce the rates of heart attacks and strokes. We have medications that certainly allow senior citizens to live more comfortably. We have medications that treat and sometimes even cure cancer. That would have been just unimaginable a few years and decades ago, but oftentimes our seniors are having to choose between the food that gives them that comfort, that quality of life and even assures them of prolonged life, and the medicine, having to choose between food and medicine. So we want to stop that. We have a good plan, and let me just review a little thing on that. First off, it fully subsidizes premium and cost-sharing up to 150 percent of the poverty level. That means those ladies that are on low income and those senior gentlemen that are on low income do not have to worry about that problem, as we have shown, choosing between food and medicine. It also provides a subsidy that is phased out between 150 and 175 percent. This is a coverage in Medicare, and it is important to understand that. It is also important to understand that people have a choice. There are several plans to choose from, so that they can get the medication that they need. It is not just a single formulary that may restrict someone or make it very, very difficult for them to get the particular medicine that they can tolerate and that treats their particular condition the best. It brings immediate relief of up to 30 percent cost reduction. It helps not only that, but there are a few other things I want to review as we close out. It protects improvements in Medicare to help reduce adverse drug interactions, provides for electronic prescribing to minimize medical errors which the complexity of medicine now certainly is needed to incorporate all the technology that we have to ensure that we reduce the medical errors to as little as few as possible. It allows pharmacy therapy management for chronic conditions, and I think disease management is part of this prescription drug plan that is very critical as we look to not only just treat the acute problems of our seniors but make sure we manage their condition to give them the best quality of life, again to help them with their retirement security, to secure their health for as long as possible. So as I close we have a plan that we will be rolling out soon to provide immediate relief that is available for all seniors that will ensure no one has to choose between food and medicine, that will also provide choice and freedom. It will also make sure that those people that have drug costs that become quite expensive, that they are not going to go bankrupt because of runaway drug costs. Mr. Speaker, it is an excellent plan. I certainly hope that we can get bipartisan support for this plan as we bring it to the House floor. As I mentioned a year and a half ago, we passed a good prescription drug bill out of this House. I think we have made marked improvements on the plan. I want to share, Mr. Speaker, this plan is not only a plan that we have worked on this year, it is the culmination of several years of work. What we found is that I think we can get a greater participation in the way this is structured; and again, the Congressional Budget Office predicts that 95 percent of the seniors will sign up for this, this voluntary program, because the benefits are so structured and so good and so attractive that they felt like seniors would sign up for this, and because it is available for all seniors. Again, it provides them with the ability to keep the plan that they have. If they have a retirement plan, and it provides prescription drug coverage, this does not impede their ability to keep that plan. It also, again through better negotiating power, gives them an immediate 30 percent estimated in their cost. We have a great disparity in this country in the fact that most people who are working can walk into a pharmacy and they can get prescription drugs at a markedly reduced cost because they have an insurance plan that negotiates the cost of those drugs and gets a reduced cost, but our seniors do not have that. They pay a substantially higher price when they walk in to buy their prescription drugs. Why, unless they have some sort of plan other than Medicare, they do not get the benefit, the negotiating power, to reduce the cost. This plan brings that power to every senior that takes advantage of this plan. I just wanted to share those few things, and let seniors know that not only providing this plan for the reasons we have mentioned because of the necessity of improving certainly retirement security and the security of our seniors' health, but it is a matter of equity. Medicare provides for acute care, and will provide, for example, bypass surgery for someone who needs surgery, but it will not provide the prescription drugs for hypertension or lowering cholesterol that are necessary.","word.count":1062,"sep11":0.76685393258427,"years":2002.62640449438,"days":2715,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.730950897851643,"Topic 2":0.0976062145454186,"Topic 3":0.0185731932171415,"Topic 4":0.0367369895624825,"Topic 5":0.0224087782658143,"Topic 6":0.0178259588270733,"Topic 7":0.0145133168746945,"Topic 8":0.0323619398098463,"Topic 9":0.0200416374578415,"Topic 10":0.00898107358804447},{"id":"10820040015631","body":"Barbara Lee: Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume I thank the gentlewoman from Texas for her very eloquent statement, also for her leadership and her passion and for her commitment to children not only in our own country but throughout the world. Let me take a minute, Mr. Speaker, to mention some of the projects actually that the gentlewoman from Texas , myself, and others have had the opportunity, a real privilege, to visit in Africa. We have become familiar with the work of many, many tireless individuals, committed individuals in Africa. We have met with many here in our own country. We have met on the Committee on International Relations and discussed these efforts. These individuals with barely a nickel have been able to do phenomenal work, and all of these projects that I am going to mention are led by very dynamic individuals who really continue to serve as a testament to what one person, one person, can accomplish when they have the determination and the compassion to care for their fellow human beings. The first project, the Mother of Peace Orphanage Community in Mutoko, Zimbabwe, is one that I have become quite familiar with. Founded in 1994 by Ms. Jean Cornneck, or Mama Jean as some of us call her, the children call her that also and they are the ones who actually coined Mama Jean as her name because she truly is the mother of peace. The Mother of Peace Community provides care, support, and shelter to over 170 children. The community builds basic family-style homes, each accommodating two to three caregivers and 10 to 15 children who are brought up in Zimbabwean culture. At present there are 11 of these houses. Mother of Peace also benefits members of the adjacent rural community through its farming and building activities in the community. It also plays a very huge role in the World Health Organization's Mutoko Poverty Alleviation and Sustainable Development Pilot Project. And I am proud to say that my own church, the Allen Temple Baptist Church, led by a great leader, Pastor J. Alfred Smith, Sr., has provided the impetus for the involvement of our community and the community in our country. And thanks to the leadership of Dr. Robert Scott and Gloria Cox Crowell, this church has set up an AIDS ministry to provide regular donations and to organize visits by our congregation to the orphanage community. It is an incredible program, and it is really a testament to how much good can be done on a shoestring budget by committed groups of people. The second program that I would like to talk about is the Bwafwano Home-based Care Organization, run by Beatrice Chola, whom I met when I traveled to Zambia last year. Working as a nurse in the Chipata health center of Lusaka, Beatrice started Bwafwano back in 1996 when she saw that the health center was overrun with HIV and AIDS and also with TB- infected patients. She recognized the strain that the Chipata health center was under, and she saw that the needs of these HIV and TB- infected patients were not being met. So she joined with several other community members to found the Bwafwano Home-based Care Organization, which literally means ``helping one another.'' Today, thanks to her leadership, Bwafwano has mushroomed into a comprehensive community care organization offering medical services, volunteer testing and counseling for HIV, schooling, home-based care, and poverty reduction and income generation programs. Since its inception, Bwafwano has trained over 300 community health workers and is currently providing home-based care to over 1,300 HIV and AIDS patients and directly observed treatment to more than 180 TB-infected patients. In addition, the organization is caring for over 1,100 orphans and vulnerable children. When I was there in August of last year, Beatrice was struggling to find just basic ways to provide school uniforms to the children that she was caring for, which was an impediment for these children to go to school, and the gentlewoman from Texas , the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands , and I met with these young people; and they were not able to go to school for one reason, and that is they did not have any uniforms. And I am proud to say and pleased to say that they do have their uniforms now so they can attend school just like any child in the community. Thankfully, again, as I said, she did receive the donation of about 300 school uniforms, but she still needs a lot of help. And of course I would like to mention the Nyumbani orphanages in Nairobi, Kenya, and I know many of us are familiar with Nyumbani. Founded in 1992 by Father Angelo D'Agostino, Nyumbani initially reached only a handful of orphans because of limited resources; but thanks to the unwavering commitment of Father D'Agostino, who worked hard to raise awareness about the needs of these orphaned children, Nyumbani now provides shelter and care and nutrition, education, psychological and social services to over 100 children on-site. But the work of Nyumbani does not stop there, as they reach out to the surrounding community to provide major assistance to nearly 800 HIV-positive children who are part of the Lea Toto Community Outreach Program in the slums of Nairobi. With the care and the devotion of the staff and all of its volunteers, Nyumbani now saves lives of most of these children while providing a model of care for nations trying to deal with their own growing HIV/AIDS epidemic. These three incredible programs, Mama Jean, Beatrice, Father Angelo D'Agostino, they are led by three dynamic and committed people; and they are proof that despite poverty, despite hardship, despite the odds, good programs can be created even in the most difficult settings. So it is programs like these that deserve our support. We had the opportunity to travel to South Africa and Mozambique with Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson in 2002. Once again it was a bipartisan delegation, and we visited several orphanages and saw exactly what many of the needs of these children were, and we took into consideration in writing this bill some of the recommendations and some of the ideas which we received not from ourselves necessarily but from what the African people told us, what African leaders, what the organizations told us that they needed. We are pleased to note that once again this has been a bipartisan effort. This is a humanitarian crisis of enormous catastrophe, really. It is a potential disaster, and we are trying to just on both sides of the House figure out a way to deal with it.

I was going to ask my colleague, if I could indulge the Speaker tonight, I began this evening by going through the testimony of a New Jerseyan, Cheryl Bolinger, who had experienced some severe problems dealing with the managed care system with her daughter.

I would like to either include it in the record now, if I could; or if not, I will put it in as an extension of remarks this evening because she really outlines very well the kinds of problems that a mother or somebody goes through when they are trying to get through this sort of Byzantine labyrinth of managed care. I just cannot imagine myself, if it was my daughter or my son, to have to go through this experience to get the proper care and to make the appeals and to deal with the objections and follow a grievance procedure. She was spending, from what I can see, more time doing this than she was with her job. She was not a woman who was in a position to be able to spend the time from 9:00 to 5:00 taking appeals of decisions that were made by HMOs. So many people face this on a regular basis. Fortunately, her daughter had a mother who had the willingness and aggressiveness and understanding about what to do, but many people do not. That is the problem. That is why we need our legislation.","word.count":430,"sep11":-4.59831460674157,"years":1997.26123595506,"days":805,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.84708981310384,"Topic 2":0.0504362357218587,"Topic 3":0.0107805453417503,"Topic 4":0.0242479956140696,"Topic 5":0.0108094700160392,"Topic 6":0.0115666306247025,"Topic 7":0.00853406295883018,"Topic 8":0.0195970079982747,"Topic 9":0.0121044323002049,"Topic 10":0.00483380632042981},{"id":"10820030010913","body":"Eliot Engel: Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Michigan and the gentleman from Illinois each will control 20 minutes.

In the commotion, the soldiers knocked over the beehives at McIntyre's farm, and the insects, along with the Charlotteans, swarmed all over the fleeing Redcoats. Four days later, frontiersmen from Georgia, Virginia, and both Carolinas destroyed the left wing of General Cornwallis's army in less than 1 hour of battle. News of the victory revived hopes, and soon patriots like Thomas Sumter, Elijah Clarke, and Francis ``the Swamp Fox'' Marion stepped up their harassment of the British troops.

It looks to me, Mr. President, like we have boiled this down to a specific issue of both bills saying they cover foreign-to-foreign surveillance. The problem is, when NSA has its eyes and its ears out on the wire, NSA does not know who an individual, who is in a foreign country, is calling--whether they are calling somebody foreign or whether they are calling somebody domestically. So if they know somebody is a foreign caller, it is imperative we provide our intelligence gatherers with the opportunity to discover the conversations that are taking place between that foreign caller and whomever they may be calling, if--and only if--it involves potential terrorist activity. And we are not going to be listening in to any foreign caller unless we know they are a member of al-Qaida under current law. So the clear difference in these two bills is this: The bill offered by Senator McConnell and Senator Bond says, very clearly, that NSA will have the tools necessary to listen to any conversation from a foreign al-Qaida member to a callee anywhere, whether it is foreign or domestic, versus the bill offered by the Democrats that may say you can have a foreign-to-foreign intercept, but the problem is there is no clarity in the Democratic proposal as to who the callee is. So it is pretty clear, if we are going to give the NSA the opportunity to protect Americans, we have to pass the bill of Senator McConnell and Senator Bond.

Vento: Mr. Speaker, the bill we are considering today does not fit the direction we should be taking in the post-cold-war world. Excessive spending on weapons systems that are not needed is not the path to security. At the same time as it provides improvements for the quality of life for our soldiers, this bill also contains punitive provisions targeting HIV-positive personnel. But more importantly this measure does not provide guidance or proper policy for the mission of our forces today much less tomorrow. Our 20,000 troops in Bosnia are there to monitor a peace agreement, to provide for the growth of peace. Despite the contrary objections, our troops in Bosnia are engaged in a clearly defined mission. In this effort our allies are assisting. Some of the most strident critics of Bosnia voice no objection to the out on sync policy regarding the long time deployment and stationing of United States troops and sailors abroad. This bill certainly does not address the issue of burden sharing or the basis for such U.S. commitments. With the end of the cold war, our role in Europe and around the world has changed greatly. We no longer need to fear a massive attack from Communist forces. Yet the troops sent to Europe during the cold war remain there with no significant redefinition of our role, literally 100,000 U.S. troops, men and material, deployed as if the world has not changed. We shoulder the burden of defense for other regions and countries with the attenuate expensive defense bills, spending on unnecessary planes, helicopters, and ships. We urgently need to realistically reassess this situation, particularly as cuts are sought in programs which help the American people. At home military bases are closed, with significant sacrifice by many communities, but abroad the same rules and sacrifice are not advanced. We need to reexamine the way we deploy and operate our forces in the world. We need to define their mission for today and tomorrow as has been done in the Bosnian operation with just a 1-year mission. Our allies must assist further with the heavy lifting involved with providing them security. Clearly military spending should not be increasing while other necessary programs are deeply cut. This bill authorizes the spending laid out in the Defense appropriations bill. While a mandated antimissile defense system was removed from the bill, the billions of added dollars in spending, dollars that the Pentagon did not request, remains in the measure. The shift to national missile defense is still contained in this bill. B-2 planes not requested by the Pentagon are authorized, $493 million more than was requested. Other new planes and weapons systems are also included, contrary to our needs in the view of the Pentagon. This new spending is not necessary and if we reassessed our security relationships with our allies, if we shared this defense responsibility more equitably, even more dollars could be taken from these accounts. But the fact is that even after the Pentagon has stated its opposition to numerous programs, a small miracle in and of itself, this 104th Congress beats its chest on budget balancing while lavishing dollars on pet projects rather than asking the tough questions that the tenor of the times and balancing the budget would demand. While the spending on weapons systems increases, important programs do not get adequate funding. The legacy of our struggle in the cold war must be addressed. Environmental cleanup of military bases, arsenals, and damage from the production of nuclear weapons need to be carried through. Yet this bill reneges in this measure, providing $280 million less than what is needed to accomplish the job of environmental cleanup. We should not leave this problem for future generations, an environmental deficit is equally unacceptable. These environmental hazards are real people security problems, where there should be no question of our mission. The legislation before us muddles our defense missions. It does not reflect a proper assessment of what we should and need to do. Congress can and should do better. Our allies need to know that we expect them to accept responsibility for their defense. The cold war is over and the ability and role of the United States has changed but much in this measure reflects business as usual. We can not afford business as usual. I urge my colleagues to vote against this conference report.","word.count":730,"sep11":-5.77808988764045,"years":1996.08146067416,"days":385,"party":"Other","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.155218451814917,"Topic 2":0.251544891669497,"Topic 3":0.147212502864829,"Topic 4":0.00402815560465717,"Topic 5":0.236351316999065,"Topic 6":0.0576495334346355,"Topic 7":0.0185861705789791,"Topic 8":0.00748528420110499,"Topic 9":0.111256842233457,"Topic 10":0.010666850598857},{"id":"10920050011124","body":"Maxine Waters: Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds I remind the gentleman that there is production off my district as well.

It is a testament to their hard work, skill, dedication, and partnership. I also commend and thank our subcommittee staff: Jim Sourwine, Mark Laisch, Sudip Parikh, Candice Rogers, and Carol Geagley. The staff deserves our gratitude for working diligently for many months, late nights, and weekends to put together this very important bill. I know every year both of these staffs reach across the aisle to work together to forge compromises on many contentious issues. I think we should all thank them and salute them. Lastly, I will take a moment to give special praise to our subcommittee staff director Bettilou Taylor. Senator Specter and I often refer to Bettilou as ``Senator Taylor.'' She has one of the toughest jobs in the Senate. This is the largest bill this year. It probably is the largest domestic appropriations bill in the history of the United States to appropriate taxpayer money for Federal purposes. This is a very complex bill with difficult issues.

To my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, truth matters, but the Constitution also matters. The President's behavior was reprehensible, outrageous, and disappointing. But as George Mason indicated, impeachable offenses are those dangerous and great offenses against the Constitution. They constitute a subversion of the Constitution. Members gathered in 1974 and refused to impeach Richard Nixon on the personal charge of tax evasion. It must be that we understand what these constitutional standards are for impeachment high crimes and misdemeanors--would that be private sexual acts--it appears not. Mr. Speaker, I wish in my Republican friends' attempt to explain to the American people that they stand by the Constitution that they would have implored their own counsel, Mr. Shippers, and, of course, Mr. Starr, not to hide the truth, for the presentations made by both men did not forthrightly acknowledge that Monica Lewinsky said, ``No one ever asked me to lie and I was never promised a job for my silence.'' I am concerned about this uneven presenting of the facts. Democrats do not want a cover-up. We simply want to have an inquiry that is fair, that is expeditious, and is not open-ended and is not a fishing expedition. What is perjury? Perjury is lying; however perjury must be proven. Sev- eral defenses if raised would disprove lying--such truth, or whether the proponent thought he or she was telling the truth, and materiality. My friends on the other side of the aisle are rushing to judgment. But I am reminded of the words of Congresswoman Barbara Jordan, ``It is reason and not passion which must guide our deliberations, guide our debate, and guide our decision.'' We must proceed deliberately--not eager to accuse without the facts. Mr. Speaker, I implore my colleagues, to let reason guide us. And then let me say to my constituents and those who face a moral dilemma, I have been in churches in my district, they believe in redemption. And, yes, the President has sinned. But those of you who want to rise and cast the first stone, my question is: Who has not sinned? And whatever we do today, those of us who have received death threats in our office, attacks against our children because of the hysteria that has been created by this Congress, I simply ask that we give this proceeding a chance to be fair, to act judiciously, and to follow the Constitution. Lastly, might I say I believe that we will survive this together as a Nation and we will do this if we let constitutional principals guide us for Isaiah 40:31 says, ``They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. They shall mount up with wings as eagles and they shall walk and not be faint.'' Mr. Speaker, I will stand for the preservation of the Constitution. It is fate that has put us all here today. But history will reflect--and tell the story of how we acted today-- whether or not the Constitution matters. Truth does matter, but the Constitution dictates that impeachable offenses be grounded in attempts to subvert the Constitution. I am supporting the democratic amendment today that focuses our review, establishes the constitutional standards, and allows us to bring this inquiry to closure by the end of the year. Truth matters and the Constitution matters. The President is not above the law, however, neither is he beneath the law. We need to act with reason, not fury, harmony not acrimony, with deliberation, not recklessness, with constitutional discharge, and not with opinion, and speculation with justice and fairness and not injustice and unfairness. Mr. Speaker, in November of 1992 President William Jefferson Clinton was elected President of the United States by focusing on the economy and using the slogan ``It's the Economy Stupid.'' I come here today with mixed feelings. We come here today not to focus on the economy, but the Constitution. It's the Constitution that matters! Article II, Section IV states that, It's the Constitution that matters! The Framers of our Constitution set the standard. George Mason, one of the Framers, stated that ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' refers to Presidential actions that are ``great and dangerous offenses'' to attempt to subvert the Constitution.'' The noted legal scholar from Yale University Professor, Charles Black, writes in his Impeachment Handbook that, This is our standard. It is clear that while we have no conduct or allegations showing the President to have committed either treason or bribery, we must focus our attention on two questions. One, what is a ``high crime and misdemeanor or an impeachable offense?, and two, did the President of the United States commit any high crimes and misdemeanors or an impeachable offense? Those are the questions, and it is up to the Congress to find the answers. We are at this point today because the President of the United States had an affair with a White House intern and he didn't want anyone to know about it, and that was wrong. However, what we have heard or seen thus far does not set out a prima facie case for impeachment. On the floor for consideration today is a Republican ``privileged resolution'' on the question to launch an impeachment inquiry ``to investigate fully and completely whether sufficient grounds exist for the House of Representatives to exercise its constitutional power to impeach the President.'' There are no limits to their investigation and no establishment of the necessary constitutional standards. Twenty-five years ago, this committee undertook the constitutional task of considering the impeachment of President Nixon. The process was painstaking, careful, and deliberative, and both the Nation and the world were reassured that America's 200 year-old Constitution worked. Impeachment is final, nonappealable without further remedy, a complete rejection of the people's will and thereby, I believe it must be done fully beyond a doubt and without rancor or vengeance--complying with every woven thread of the Constitution. Today, by contrast, the world and the American people have been alternatively puzzled, confused, and appalled by the reckless media circus our automatic dumping of documents has produced. On July 24, 1974, the House Judiciary Committee had a meeting to consider the Impeachment of President Richard Nixon. One of my predecessors of the 18th Congressional District of Texas, the late, great, Barbara Jordan said that, So I, like my predecessor come not to subvert or destroy the Constitution, but to uphold it. I am fully aware like most of my colleagues, that this privileged resolution only allows for a 10-minute motion to recommit, and not the regular full time allotted to consider a Democratic amendment. In order for this process to be fair and balanced and for the American people to truly hear both sides of this debate the House should waive House Rule IX, and allow the Democratic amendment to be considered, for a certain designated time. The Republicans refused that request. While the Republican resolution does not have a time certain for the inquiry to end, the Democratic amendment calls for the Judiciary Committee to make a full recommendation to the House concerning Articles of Impeachment by no later than December 31, 1998. This is a compromise. There must be fairness and balance. The Democrats have also yielded on the provision which allows the House to consider other pertinent matters, as long as it is referred by the Independent Counsel, and not arbitrarily decided by Congress. This impeachment inquiry must be limited in scope and have a time certain. On February 6, 1974, Congressman Hutchinson, then the ranking Republican on the committee spoke on the floor of the House about the Watergate inquiry and said, The American people have spoken and they have said that this has gone on too long. This can not be an endless process. There must be time certain or the House should ``end its labors.'' So far what we have in Congress is the word of one man, an Independent Counsel who is not duly elected by the people. We have convoluted facts, inconsistent stories and versions, possible illegal tape recordings, but no real hard evidence. In Act V of Macbeth, William Shakespeare writes, That's what we have so far Mr. Speaker. We have fury, but no facts, and a tale told by a nonelected official that is full of allegations, not yet fact signifying anything. As the Watergate Committee's February 1974 Staff Report explained, ``In an impeachment proceeding a President is called to account for abusing powers that only a President possesses.'' In Watergate, as in all prior impeachments, the allegations concerned official misconduct that threatened to subvert the constitutional order or balance, not private misbehavior. Impeachment is not a personal punishment. In all of American history, no official has been impeached for misbehavior unrelated to his official responsibilities. I make no attempt to excuse the President's behavior, but as we vote on whether to launch a full scale impeachment inquiry, I admonish my colleagues that we must adhere to the constitution and the writings of the Framers. It's the Constitution that matters! As James Wilson explained in the Pennsylvania ratification convention: ``far from being above the laws, [the President] is amenable to them in this private character as [a] citizen, and in his public character by impeachment.'' The Constitution imposes a grave and serious responsibility on us to protect the fabric of the Constitution. To perform our job requires that we investigate the facts thoroughly before we begin dealing with what our predecessors called ``delicate issues of basic constitutional law.'' We must avoid prejudging the","word.count":1848,"sep11":-3.00280898876404,"years":1998.85674157303,"days":1373,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.00731358608099063,"Topic 2":0.393830512179138,"Topic 3":0.222643315310776,"Topic 4":0.00911008904674425,"Topic 5":0.0176715732138477,"Topic 6":0.00477470474182698,"Topic 7":0.31416515224053,"Topic 8":0.00576152585591966,"Topic 9":0.0215739762846957,"Topic 10":0.00315556504553095},{"id":"10720020007237","body":"Dave Weldon: Well, I thank the gentleman for bringing this issue up, because I just had a conversation with our Governor, Jed Bush, about this very issue. The A-Plus plan is a very simple plan. If the school is scored low, parents can take their child and the money that was going to their child and go to a private school. The education bureaucracy, teachers unions, liberals on the left went absolutely berserk. They said it would be the total demise of public education in the State of Florida. It was the end of the world, and the sky was falling. There was only one or two schools that scored really low, and a few kids went off into the private system. But what really happened was that every single school in the State made a tremendous effort, particularly the failing schools, the poorly performing schools, to improve their act. Because no school, no teacher wanted to be at a school that was scored low, no principal wanted to be the principal of that school. What happened is the entire academic performance of the whole State has gone up. The Governor of our State told me that piece of legislation was the single most important piece of legislation to improve the quality of education in the State of Florida in probably 20, 30, or 40 years. It motivated teachers, principals, administrators to work very, very hard because they knew they were being held accountable. In my opinion, I would say this to Governors and school administrators all over the United States: You want to improve education? Establish a program like we did in Florida. Because that is what happened. We were doing annual studies on all these schools, how many kids are failing, and the grades came up. Average grades came up, and schools started performing better. It was absolutely miraculous. I do not know what else to say. We need that. Part of the problem in education in America is there are a lot of systems where there is no accountability. They can turn out kids that just are not learning year after year and nothing happens to anybody. They keep their jobs, they keep their positions. Under the threat of actually being held accountable, it has been absolutely tremendous. Talk to our lieutenant governor, Frank Brogan, who previously was the education commissioner in the State of Florida; and he has been following this issue very, very closely, as well as our current education commissioner. And they will tell you hands down the A-Plus program was a fabulous, fantastic success. Frankly, I was disappointed we were not able to include that in the President's education reform package. I was very disappointed that it was opposed by many people in this body as well as the other body; and ultimately, in the end, we were not successful in including it in the package. I believe we need to fight for that in the years ahead because it makes a difference in the lives of kids. I am glad the gentleman brought it up. I am happy to speak about it anywhere because it is the truth. The A-Plus plan helped kids, and that is really what it is all about.","word.count":538,"sep11":0.651685393258427,"years":2002.51123595506,"days":2674,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.746514949327888,"Topic 2":0.0844070894213396,"Topic 3":0.0183637780457605,"Topic 4":0.0390154274246368,"Topic 5":0.0187238754093806,"Topic 6":0.0175150798849644,"Topic 7":0.0146157205104219,"Topic 8":0.0319025652509988,"Topic 9":0.0203689196321107,"Topic 10":0.00857259509249873},{"id":"11020080059722","body":"Richard J. Durbin: Mr. President, at this moment in the U.S. Capitol, there are scores, if not hundreds, of employees at work. It is unusual for most of them to be here on a Saturday, but sometimes it is necessary. It is unusual for the Senate to be in session on a Saturday, but sometimes it is necessary. One can certainly argue that when the United States is facing a serious issue, we should be at work, whether it requires our being here on Saturday, Sunday, or all the days of the week. That is what we were elected to do. Certainly, the housing bill, which is before us now, is a matter of grave concern to many of us who see across America foreclosures that are taking away the homes of many American families and affecting the value of millions of other homes. But this could have been done yesterday. In fact, it could have been done weeks ago. Six different times, the Republicans initiated filibusters to stop this housing bill--six different times. They have set all the records in the Senate for filibusters, and they applied six of them to the housing bill. To add insult to injury, they added a day of session, a totally unnecessary day of session for which we are meeting this morning. This could have been sent to the President yesterday. He could have signed it, bringing some assurance and confidence to consumers across America that maybe this housing crisis can be put behind us and this economy can move forward. But one Senator, the Senator from South Carolina, insisted that the Members of the Senate all stay here today. It is the second time in 2 weeks he has taken away a day of our lives with our families. This time the Senator from South Carolina is going to be here for the vote he has asked for, and I think that is good. It certainly is his right to do that. You say to yourself: There must be some matter of great moment that would have him keep the entire Senate here for an extra day, cause us to ask scores, if not hundreds, of people to come and work that extra day. Well, what is that issue? The issue is whether we are going to put some language in to limit or prohibit two Federal agencies--Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac--from having lobbyists on Capitol Hill. It is a good issue. I might even vote with him on this issue. But to think he would hold the Senate for another day, make us open this session and bring all those people to work for this amendment on a bill which we know must pass, which the President has urged us to pass, is hard to understand. It is his right to do it. It is any Senator's right to do it. But there comes a point when you step back and say: We can fight this battle another day. This is not a life-or-death issue. This is not an issue that has to be decided on this Saturday or else. But we are here. We are here to face this issue, deal with the housing bill, which I hope will pass. President Bush initially opposed this bill. The President said there were provisions in here he could not accept. But then there was a serious concern across America as to whether these critical agencies--Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are involved in standing behind almost half the mortgages in America--were being threatened. I got a personal call from Secretary Henry Paulson, our Secretary of the Treasury, at home last week. He said: We have to do something. This is an emergency. I said to Secretary Paulson: I think you are right. I may not agree exactly with your approach, but there comes a time when we have to rise together, on a bipartisan basis, and deal with a serious crisis. This could be a crisis if we do not act. I said to him: Would you urge the Republican Members of the Senate to have the same sense of urgency in passing this housing bill that I hear in your voice? He said he would try. Well, he was not very successful. Six different times the Republicans have tried to stop this housing bill with a filibuster and now have dragged us into a Saturday session here to slow it down again. But today, with any luck, it will pass, and finally we will send it to the President's desk. The President said he is prepared to sign it. This is too serious an issue for him to stand in the way. I am glad the President has made that decision. I do not think it is going to turn around the American economy, but we know the housing crisis certainly started us on the skids that are leading us toward a recession. There are much bigger issues in our economy that need to be resolved even beyond housing. The simple fact is, the overwhelming majority of Americans are worried and angry--worried about their own financial situation. They have seen the values of their homes plummet. They have seen their retirement savings diminished by a stock market that is unpredictable. They know the cost of gasoline is taking more money out of their wallets and credit cards every single week. A trip to the food store is a little more expensive than it used to be. It costs more money to put those kids through school. And if you get stuck with medical bills now, it could break the bank and empty your savings account. That is the reality of life in America today. The Bush economic policy has failed. This notion that we can somehow give tax breaks to the wealthiest people in America and prosper as a nation never did make sense and has resulted in the mess we have today. This notion that we can wage a war and spend $12 billion to $15 billion a month for almost 6 years now and not suffer some problems in America as a result never made sense. It does not make sense today. Each month the administration adds that money to the deficit, piling up more debt on America's kids, debt that is currently financed by foreign governments that step in and buy America's mortgages. What a legacy: an economy that is so weak that people are worried and even angry; a prospect of more of the same, unless there is a real change in Washington; and when it comes to the Senate, a slowdown. Let's slow it down with six filibusters when it comes to a housing bill. Let's make the Senate meet on a Saturday. Let's keep them in. Let's try to slow this down even more. That is the Republican approach. It is not a good approach. I think there are Republican Senators of good will who understand we can do better. Let me point out one: Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama. He stepped up. As the ranking Republican on the Banking Committee, he and Senator Chris Dodd, our Democratic chairman, worked together to get this bill done. I salute him and all who helped him bring this bill to the floor. That is the kind of bipartisan spirit we need: that sense of urgency, that sense of bringing the bill to the floor to do something for our Nation. I wish his voice had prevailed in the Republican conference and all those filibusters had not taken place and this unnecessary Saturday session had not taken place. But the decision was made by the leadership to allow this to go forward, and that is their decision. Mr. President, I will say a word about what Senator Kyl addressed on the energy package. It is hard for me to understand how my friend from Arizona--and he is my friend--could stand here and suggest we have stopped the Republicans from offering their solution to deal with America's energy crisis. We did not. Senator Kyl knows we said to them: Put together your package and bring it to the floor. We will do the same. Let's have two competing ideas. Let's debate them. Let's give them the same vote. And then let's decide. That is what we are supposed to do, isn't it? We are elected, on a bipartisan basis, to try to solve problems. With 51 Democrats and 49 Republicans, things have to be done on a bipartisan basis for most important issues. But Senator Kyl and Senator McConnell, on the Republican side, rejected that. They said: No, we want to start an amendment process. Let's see how this unfolds. Let's bring out seven amendments to start with and you can bring out whatever you want and let's talk it over and let's go through the debate. Unfortunately, that would have led to nothing because we have a deadline facing us. Coming in just a few days, we are going to break for our August recess. We could have been mired down in the debate with an endless number of amendments and nothing would have happened. The American people want something to happen. They want us to deal with this energy crisis, and they understand simply saying we are going to drill for more oil, on its face, does not make sense. The United States, in all of its oil reserves we can identify and think of, has about 3 percent of the world's supply of oil. But we are big oil consumers in this country. We consume 25 percent of the oil produced in the world each year. Mr. President, 3 percent available, 25 percent consumption. As T. Boone Pickens, now the patriarch, I guess, of energy policy, said: We can't drill our way out of this problem. T. Boone Pickens is an oilman. He knows we need more. We need responsible exploration and production. We need to use the land we have already leased. We need to tell the oil and gas companies that are reporting record profits: Get to work, find those sources of oil that you already think are there in this leased Federal land, and go after them. Do it in a responsible way. Do not pollute our beaches and do not pollute our Nation. Do it in a sensible and responsible way. I think all of us would endorse that. I hope that is what the Republicans stand for too. But it is not enough. We need conservation and fuel efficiency. We need cars and trucks that get much better miles per gallon. We need to be thinking about the buildings that are being constructed and the lives we lead and how, in small and large ways, we can change our energy consumption without compromising our economy. We need to be thinking about renewable, sustainable sources. It breaks my heart that three different times we brought to the floor this energy tax extender, which would create tax incentives for more renewable, sustainable energy--wind power, solar p","word.count":2169,"sep11":7.05056179775281,"years":2008.91011235955,"days":4952,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.876030100686948,"Topic 2":0.0389988954321599,"Topic 3":0.00844885440509311,"Topic 4":0.0192299995961761,"Topic 5":0.00899756884076965,"Topic 6":0.00899563777085546,"Topic 7":0.00668362531986262,"Topic 8":0.0196579429593773,"Topic 9":0.00886580779391479,"Topic 10":0.00409156719484378},{"id":"10920050076293","body":"John Ensign: Mr. President, Senator Byrd has offered an amendment virtually identical to a piece of legislation that I brought forward because he has the same concerns I have. When I took over the chairmanship of the Readiness Subcommittee, the staff briefed me on various hearings that they do traditionally during the year. One of the hearings, the information that we got at the hearing, this piece of legislation was trying to address. It was the reason I drafted it, because I had literally the identical concerns Senator Byrd has raised today. Nothing he has said have I disagreed with. This happened last year. We used to have one of these hearings a year. I have actually stepped them up to every 6 months. We have a hearing tomorrow in the Readiness Subcommittee on this very issue, as well as others on the business transformation for the military. The military is a huge bureaucracy that none of us have our arms around. The military doesn't have its arms around its own bureaucracy. There are incredible inefficiencies. The problem is, you get one person in; they are there for a year, maybe two. They say they are going to be making changes. They have been promising to make changes for years. And then nothing happens. Last year, I was ready to proceed with my legislation. I met with Secretary England, and he asked me for 1 year. He said: Give me a year. I am new in this position. Give me a year. If you are not satisfied at the end of that year, if we haven't made significant progress, then go forward with your legislation. I reluctantly said: OK. You are new. I liked some of the ideas he was laying out. He was going in the right direction. I said, reluctantly: I will give you the year. Tomorrow we are having a hearing to see at least what progress they have made in the last 6 to 8 months. Depending on what happens at that hearing--from some of the preliminary results we have received, there is some progress being made--we are going to delve into it much more deeply tomorrow, plus what we see over the next several months. If we are not satisfied, I will be the first person to join the Senator from West Virginia on this legislation next year to create this position. The reason I thought this was good, that it was a good idea to make this change, was because to have somebody focused on the business goings on at the Department of Defense made good common sense to me. I didn't want to see another layer of bureaucracy created. But with the Deputy Secretary of Defense, I didn't see them focused on the business activities. I saw them focused on warfighting activities--all well and good. We want them focused on that. But these other duties seem to be neglected at the same time. I commit to the Senator from West Virginia that I am absolutely willing to work with him on this, with the same goals in mind; that is, to reform our Defense Department to make it more efficient, more accountable, more transparent in the way that it actually performs business. It is never going to operate like a business, but we have to get it to operate more like a business than it does today. I think the spirit of this amendment is absolutely right. I would ask that we would either go the direction of what Senator Warner has suggested or at least wait until next spring, when we go for reauthorizing the Defense Department again next year, to address this issue, simply because I made that personal commitment to Acting Deputy Secretary Gordon England. I would be more than happy to yield back or engage in a colloquy or whatever the Senator from West Virginia would like at this point.","word.count":649,"sep11":4.26685393258427,"years":2006.12640449438,"days":3961,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0799785225661188,"Topic 2":0.33075424073045,"Topic 3":0.146886480899852,"Topic 4":0.00555380129645725,"Topic 5":0.0130617215171666,"Topic 6":0.406662466411793,"Topic 7":0.00386148366136576,"Topic 8":0.00578221920771634,"Topic 9":0.00553399896926869,"Topic 10":0.00192506473981118},{"id":"11020070007424","body":"John R.

We are now hearing that Medicare, in fact, will become insolvent 7 years sooner than we had been told last year. During the time between last year and this year, there has been a Medicare bill passed by the Senate. I believe there is a direct correlation between what was passed, which I have deep concerns about, and the new number we are hearing about Medicare being jeopardized and becoming insolvent 7 years sooner. We know that in the bill that was passed last year, there were payments for the first time to private plans so they could compete with traditional Medicare. We know that, according to the Congressional Budget Office, it in fact has cost 13.2 percent more for the private sector through Medicare+Choice to provide the very same services as traditional Medicare. Rather than saying we should go, then, with the most cost-effective way to provide health care services for seniors and use traditional Medicare, the response, unfortunately, from the Congress and the President was to subsidize private insurance companies and HMOs so they could compete more favorably. Originally, it was $14 billion taken away from providing prescription drug coverage for seniors, helping to pay for their medicine, taking those dollars away from other preventive services that could be paid for, other direct services that could be given to our seniors, and it was put into providing subsidies for the private sector. Now we see in the new numbers how all of this has changed with the revelation of the tremendous increase in the cost of the Medicare bill which we were told after it passed. We are now told the first estimate of $14 billion being diverted is now really $46 billion being diverted--$46 billion not going to pay for our seniors receiving help with their medicine, to afford their medicine through Medicare, but being diverted to essentially privatize or help private plans be able to compete because it costs more to provide Medicare coverage and prescription drug coverage under private plans. We see greater costs there. Then right at the time we need to be doing everything possible to leverage and lower our costs, we know this Medicare prescription drug bill actually says in the middle of the bill that Medicare is not allowed to group purchase, to get bulk discounts, which is astounding. Every time I say that to a group of people at home in Michigan, they look at me in bewilderment: What in the world were you thinking that you would not try to get the best possible price through a bulk discount? Yet we know that one of the reasons there is increased costs in this bill is because they are not doing bulk purchasing. Why are they not doing bulk purchasing? Because the pharmaceutical industry does not want that to be done. They do not want us to get lower prices. They want us to pay the highest possible prices. So, unfortunately, this bill says that, which is another reason why I opposed the passage of the Medicare bill. Over and over we are seeing situations unravel that cause me great concern, not only about the new dollar amount, the new substance in this bill, but also about the process that brought us to the passage of the Medicare bill. I will speak now to some of what we have been hearing and reading in recent days and weeks. The Government's top expert on Medicare costs was warned he would be fired if he told key lawmakers about a series of Bush administration cost estimates that could have torpedoed congressional passage of the White House-backed Medicare prescription drug plan. This was written on March 12 of this year, just last week, in the Miami Herald. We know there were new estimates, new actual costs that were identified, and we were not told about them before the passage of this bill. We know that between November 20 and 24 of last year, administration officials repeatedly stated without qualification that the prescription drug bill ``will not cost more than $400 billion over 10 years.'' In making these representations, administration officials relied on CBO estimates without citing the conflicting estimates from their own analysts. This comes from a special report Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson gave at the time, as well as other news reports. We then found out after the new year on January 29--not November, now we move up to January 29--the administration announced the Medicare drug bill would cost at least $534 billion over 10 years--$139 billion more, just as we find the new subsidies for private plans, insurance companies, and HMOs have gone up, and certainly there is no cost containment in this bill. On January 30, the President indicated he learned of the new estimates only 2 weeks earlier, but yet we find on February 12 Secretary Thompson testified to the House Ways and Means Committee that they were given the final higher drug cost on Christmas Eve of 2003, which contradicts the President's earlier statements. Then on top of having conflicting information about the cost and when the administration knew about the cost, we also hear from a colleague of mine in Michigan, Representative Nick Smith, who said last fall unknown GOP colleagues had tried to bribe him into voting for the contentious prescription drug bill on November 22 by promising campaign help to his son who is running to replace his retiring father. This was reported in the Washington Post on March 15 of this year. We now know there is an ethics investigation going on in the House of Representatives regarding this process. We know when this bill first came up in the House, they did not have the votes for it and kept the board open an unprecedented 3 hours plus to change votes, to get the votes for this Medicare bill. Republican colleagues have said that if they had known the true cost at that time, they would not have voted for it. The cost was hidden. We did not find out what the true costs are, and then we see tremendous pressure on colleagues to vote for this bill, and now the Ethics Committee is looking into what happened in at least one circumstance. Then we move to another area of great concern to me, and that is the advertising of this particular legislation, this new Medicare bill. According to the New York Times on March 16: I also have concerns because in that particular taxpayer-funded advertising, we have found, as a result of a GAO report and a request for investigation that we asked to have done on March 10, the GAO concluded that the Bush administration's Medicare advertisements contain notable omissions and other weaknesses. While they indicate they are not unlawful, they have notable omissions and other weaknesses. One of my concerns about all of this is that we are seeing a lack of truthfulness regarding the cost of this bill. Many of us had great concerns about this bill in the beginning. We had colleagues being told one thing and then finding out another, saying if they had known, they would not have supported the bill; high pressure tactics going on and an ethics investigation now related to what was done in the House; and then we see taxpayers' dollars being used to put forward less than accurate information. The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.","word.count":1265,"sep11":2.59831460674157,"years":2004.45786516854,"days":3367,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0659294154080779,"Topic 2":0.457935410644543,"Topic 3":0.0143007760730642,"Topic 4":0.0126134600630751,"Topic 5":0.0208111146178952,"Topic 6":0.0164894163977589,"Topic 7":0.00919716831369954,"Topic 8":0.150459547837445,"Topic 9":0.0530734353926647,"Topic 10":0.199190255251776},{"id":"10519970079963","body":"Speaker: Mr. President, I support the amendment by Senator Hutchison modifying the bill's language on funding for the Korean Energy Development Organization, which we refer to as KEDO. I would like to step back for a moment to 1995, shortly after the agreed framework was signed in October of 1994. By March of 1995, there was the first evidence that the North Koreans were cheating. In hearings before this subcommittee and in writing, I challenged the administration's assertions that the North was in full compliance and that no U.S. oil was being diverted. Eventually, it became clear that the North was cheating and diverting oil. Although new monitoring procedures were established, there was no suspension of oil or a threat to cut off the program. I am convinced that this is when the North learned that they could engage in a pattern of challenge, deception and noncompliance without any penalty at all. In fiscal year 1997, the Senate had an extensive debate about providing U.S. assistance to provide fuel oil to North Korea and to support administrative expenses for KEDO. The bill my subcommittee reported to the Senate capped funds at $13 million, half the administration's request, and provided the funds in three stages, requiring certification that the fuel was not--I repeat, not--being diverted for military purposes. At that time, many of us were uncomfortable continuing any aid to this terrorist regime, let alone doubling the amount available which the administration had requested. In its statement of policy, this is what the administration had to say at that time about any curbs, cuts or conditions: Again, that is what they had to say. Regrettably, the administration prevailed on this floor in a 73-to-27 vote allowing full funding for KEDO. So I lost that one, I say to my friend from Texas. Mr. President, I think it is now safe to say that on both the nonproliferation and burden-sharing front, KEDO is a bust. All last week, the administration was too busy with bilateral talks in New York to brief the committee on the status of negotiations over allegations disclosed in the press that the North is building a secret facility to house a nuclear reactor replacing the one sealed under the Agreed Framework. With those talks still underway, as the Senator from Texas pointed out, Monday--this week--for the first time in more than 5 years, North Korea carried out a flight test of a ballistic missile which the South Korean Government estimates has a range of over 1,200 miles. The first stage of the missile landed in waters between Russia and Japan, with the second stage flying over Japanese territory and falling into the Pacific. Understandably, the Japanese have withdrawn their pledge of billions of dollars for the construction of an alternative reactor--a perfectly logical response to what happened Monday. Mr. President, if U.S. funding for KEDO is the pillar of our nonproliferation policy and the key to burden sharing, I think it is time we start building a new foundation for our policy. Secret nuclear facilities, flight testing, ballistic missiles, and who knows what other activities are not a nonproliferation policy, they are simply a nonpolicy. Today, I say to the Senator from Texas, I think her amendment is excellent and is exactly the direction in which we should go. The administration will complain that these new conditions are not consistent with the Agreed Framework, that the North did not agree to suspend its nuclear weapons program in return for $30 million, they only agreed to freeze part of it. Mr. President, it makes no sense for the United States to continue to pay for an agreement which fails to protect our allies and our interests in the Pacific. Monday's tests, along with the past pattern of deception and diversion, should convince all of us we should not spend millions more from our limited foreign aid coffers to prop up a government determined to acquire and to sell nuclear weapons. As I mentioned previously, this is hardly the first time we have debated the administration's flawed policy on the peninsula. We have had years of compromise, capitulation, and concessions from the administration. The North blusters and blackmails; there is tough talk followed by no action or, worse still, concessions for more fuel and food. Thirty-six thousand American troops standing guard in the South deserve more than that. Once and for all, it should be absolutely clear to the North, we will not pay their way to test, deploy, or sell nuclear weapons. We will not pay for the appearance or possibility of compliance with the Agreed Framework. Again, I commend the Senator from Texas. I think her amendment is right on the mark and I congratulate her for it.","word.count":283,"sep11":-4.08426966292135,"years":1997.77528089888,"days":988,"party":"Other","chamber":"","Topic 1":0.387227509920121,"Topic 2":0.491337086037793,"Topic 3":0.00579629877173792,"Topic 4":0.0355368482180983,"Topic 5":0.00843818595175005,"Topic 6":0.00469278076553145,"Topic 7":0.00809383202851444,"Topic 8":0.00650155270189709,"Topic 9":0.0480489867724783,"Topic 10":0.00432691883207812},{"id":"11020080065421","body":"Harry Reid: The next vote is exactly the same as this vote.

We all have anguished over the casualties and rejoiced in the moments of relief, such as the rescue of Jessica Lynch. Americans, regardless of their views on the war, hung on every bit of news of her recovery, and watched with fascination as she spoke her few but powerful words upon returning home to West Virginia. We just assumed that the cost of her health care and rehabilitation would be covered by the U.S. Government. After all, that is only fair. The system that is responsible for caring for wounded service members after they are discharged is over-burdened and under-funded. The Veterans Administration health care system has been shortchanged for years, with health care budgets falling well short of inflation. While the Bush administration proposed a slight increase in funding this year, it is still not enough to keep up with inflation. Vietnam Veterans of America has estimated that at expected appropriations levels for this coming fiscal year, the VA health care system is $52 million short of the amount needed to implement existing VA programs and to keep pace with inflation since 1997. Every VA hospital has been forced to do more with less, to continuously reduce costs, year after year, and to limit services to veterans. Long waiting lines have developed at many VA centers, sometimes keeping veterans waiting as much as a year for an initial appointment. Due to inadequate funding, Secretary Principi, a strong advocate for veterans, has been forced to deny an entire category of veterans treatment at VA hospitals. I compliment my colleagues, Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski, for their efforts to address this funding shortfall. As the chair and ranking member of the subcommittee with jurisdiction over appropriations for the Veterans Administration, they are well aware of the urgency of the VA's needs. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of their amendment to add $1.3 billion to this legislation specifically for VA health care. In drafting the VA's appropriations bill for the coming fiscal year, they identified this funding as urgently needed by the VA, and it is imperative that this funding be provided in this bill. Our top priority must be caring for the men and women who answered the President's call and stepped into harm's way. They must be taken care of. If the Federal Government has any obligation to its people, is not its first obligation to care for the wounds of its soldiers? Every day we hear of more Americans injured in Iraq. I cringe for them and for their families. It is a great burden that most of them will carry all their lives. I also fear that in the years to come, we will learn that the harsh conditions in Iraq today have in more subtle ways damaged the health of our troops stationed there. The burden of studying these problems and caring for these soldiers will fall on the VA health care system. I, for one, cannot stand by while the VA is starved for resources. This is the time to act. I urge all my colleagues to support the Bond- Mikulski amendment to add $1.3 billion to care for America's veterans.","word.count":562,"sep11":2.15168539325843,"years":2004.01123595506,"days":3208,"party":"Other","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.236741834561061,"Topic 2":0.408119915482752,"Topic 3":0.00669037394134639,"Topic 4":0.00908602648438178,"Topic 5":0.0143154458531488,"Topic 6":0.00394476136654542,"Topic 7":0.00767148831044818,"Topic 8":0.00651117484021739,"Topic 9":0.300862671730674,"Topic 10":0.0060563074294248},{"id":"10920050072474","body":"James Jeffords: Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Military Family Support Act of 2005 with my colleague and friend from Wisconsin, Senator Russ Feingold. Our bill will help military families ease the stress caused by long-term absences due to deployments overseas. I was contacted a few months back by a group of Vermonters looking for a way to help their coworkers with family in the Vermont National Guard. When a member of the armed forces is activated and deployed, family structures and daily functioning are severely affected. The day- to-day life of families is, in many cases, more than a one-person job. Any absence, especially absences of several months due to a deployment overseas, can be debilitating to family life. The stories of soldiers and their families from Enosburg Falls, VT, were told very poignantly in a piece reported by the Los Angeles Times. Enosburg and neighboring communities have contributed a disproportionately high number of National Guard troops to Operation Iraqi Freedom. Because of this, Enosburg's men and women have felt the pains of separation and long deployments more than most. Enosburg and surrounding towns and villages should be proud of the sacrifices made by their men and women in uniform and by those employers and family members who remained at home. Vermont is a place where neighbors help neighbors and I am proud of all the people throughout the state who have given so much support to Guard families. The Military Family Support Act of 2005 is a straightforward bill that proposes two pilot programs. The first pilot program, administered by the Office of Personnel Management, OPM, would authorize Federal employees, who have been designated by a member of the Armed Forces as ``caregivers'', as defined by the Department of Defense, DOD, to use their leave in a more flexible manner. No new leave would be conferred to any employees. This bill simply makes leave already available more useful during stressful times for military families. The second pilot program would be established by the Department of Labor, DOL, to solicit businesses to voluntarily take part in a program to offer more accommodating leave to their employees. This bill does not include in its scope the Family Medical Leave Act, FMLA, and it does not require any private sector entity to participate. The goal of the Military Family Support Act is to make life a little easier for those who are already giving so much to our country and to their communities. I ask unanimous consent that a May 2, 2005, article from the Los Angeles Times be printed in the Record. I also ask unanimous consent that the text of the Military Family Support Act of 2005 be printed in Record.

I do not want to interfere with this important debate, but I think the subject I want to speak about is important in its own right. I want to put my colleagues and the public on notice about what is happening. Probably we have all received more telephone calls and more letters on the so-called Satellite Home Viewer Act than any issue we have dealt with in this Congress. This is an issue that flows from the fact that people who have satellite dishes, especially people who live in the country, want to have access to their nearest television station. It is something we all understand. For those of us who live in the country, it is something we want. The House of Representatives adopted a very good bill that would allow negotiations between satellites and local television stations with a goal of bringing the local television station into every living room and den in America. This would be a great boon to people who have satellite dishes in rural areas. That bill was adopted in the House 422 to 1 on April 27. On May 20, the Senate unanimously adopted a similar bill. These bills are very strongly supported. We are all getting hundreds of telephone calls in support of them. They do what each caller wants, and that is make it possible for people, especially in rural areas, who have satellite dishes to get the news and the weather from the local station, however far away that may be. The problem is, for some unexplainable reason--at least unexplainable to logic--in the conference, rather than adopting the House bill or the Senate bill or something in between, the conferees apparently decided that not every problem in the world was solved, and therefore in an effort to try to solve problems which were not part of either bill, they decided to put the American taxpayer on the hook for a $1.25 billion loan guarantee. I want to make it clear. This loan guarantee was not part of the Senate bill for which we voted unanimously. It was not part of the House bill that passed 422 to 1. It was produced out of whole cloth in conference when the basic idea was there are additional problems that might be dealt with, so as a result, we want to simply add $1.25 billion. When you approach the people who added it, you get the idea this is somehow for small business. But when you read their bill, one of the loans can be as large as $625 million. The two obvious beneficiaries are two companies, one of which saw its equity value go up 4\\1/2\\ times the rate of the growth of the Dow Industrial Index over the last 12 months; the other one saw its equity value go up 49 times as fast as Dow did in the last 12 months. You might wonder why these two extraordinarily successful businesses with an explosion in their equity value, as measured by the value of common stock, suddenly need the taxpayer to come forth and sign a loan guarantee of $1.25 billion to get to the bottom line. I am for the satellite bill. I voted for it in the Senate. I would like to see it passed. I think it is an important piece of legislation. But I am adamantly opposed to Members of the House and the Senate simply deciding to put the taxpayer on the hook for $1.25 billion, with a provision that was in neither the House bill or Senate bill, a provision that cannot be justified by any logic whatsoever. I want to make it clear if that bill comes to the floor of the Senate and it has that loan guarantee in there obligating the American taxpayer for $1.25 billion, money that was not in the House bill, was not in the Senate bill, I intend to object to its consideration, and it will not become law in this millennium. I cannot speak beyond this thousand years. But I can assure you that under the rules of the Senate, it will not become law before the turn of the new millennium, if then. One of the authors of this provision, referring to me, said: I don't think anybody would want to have the reputation of having cost millions of Americans the loss of their network signal, so I don't anticipate problems on either floor. My response to our colleague in the House is: Anticipate problems on the floor of the Senate. And if anyone is endangering the ability of Americans to get the local television signal, it is not me; it is those who have added a $1.25 billion loan guarantee in this bill. I know there are going to be a lot of people calling my office and others. Here is my message: If you are for the satellite bill, if you want to be able to get your local television station, don't bother calling me. Call the people who want to add to a conference report this $1.25 billion giveaway which was not voted on in either House of Congress, and say to them: Quit trying to give my money away and give me my local television signal. I am not going to let this bill be adopted this year with that $1.25 billion giveaway in it. It is not too late. The conferees can come to their senses and take this provision out. It was not in either bill. It should not have been there to begin with. We can have the satellite bill passed by the end of tomorrow's business. But if it is not taken out, it is not going to be adopted. I wanted to come over and make that clear so everybody would know exactly where we are. If you want this bill, insist the $1.25 billion giveaway be taken out of it. We have the ability and we should make it possible for people in the country to get the adjacent cities' TV stations. I am for that. I am a direct beneficiary of it. Many of the people I care about are. But the idea we are talking about giving away $1.25 billion in loan guarantees to some of the most well-off companies in America as a rider on this bill is the kind of outrageous legislative action that has to be stopped. If they think because the underlying bill is so popular that everybody is just going to turn the other way and let this $1.25 billion giveaway occur, they are wrong. I do not intend to do that. It is not going to pass the Senate unless they take it out. I yield the floor.","word.count":1132,"sep11":-1.8876404494382,"years":1999.97191011236,"days":1770,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0864205557054569,"Topic 2":0.142623952215413,"Topic 3":0.00552155809978053,"Topic 4":0.160362365244017,"Topic 5":0.030608625276963,"Topic 6":0.290088999797436,"Topic 7":0.00687830227605542,"Topic 8":0.0860184856930521,"Topic 9":0.0743808219436033,"Topic 10":0.117096333748223},{"id":"10419960068986","body":"Kent Conrad: Mr. President, whatever else one can say, this President has delivered on his promise to cut the budget deficit in half. In fact, he has more than delivered on his promise. I listened with great interest to my colleague, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. I respect and admire Senator Domenici, but I must say, facts are facts, the record is the record. The record of this administration and this President with respect to deficit reduction is clear and unassailable. This President said he would cut the budget deficit in half. He has cut the budget deficit in half. If we compare his record to the record of his immediate predecessors, he can be especially proud of what he has accomplished. The fact is, as this chart demonstrates, this is what has happened under the previous three Presidents. President Reagan came in and inherited a deficit of about $60 billion. Under his leadership, those deficits skyrocketed. In fact, they were tripled until they were up in a range of $220 billion. At the end of his term, we saw some reduction, back to the range of $150 billion. Then, under the new administration, the administration of President Bush, the deficits again took off. They took off like a scalded cat. What we saw was record deficits. In fact, in the last year of the Bush administration, the budget deficit reached an all-time high of $290 billion. President Clinton took office and in each year--in each succeeding year for now 4 years in a row--we have seen a reduction in the budget deficits, a substantial reduction. As I indicated, the head of the Congressional Budget Office, June O'Neill, has said in a letter dated today that she anticipates the deficit will be $115 to $130 billion this year. That is even better than this chart shows, because this chart indicates the last estimates we had. That indicated the deficit would come in at about $145 billion this year. That, too, would have kept the President's promise of cutting the deficit in half. The news today is even better, suggesting the deficit will be about down here with respect to this chart, a very steep decline. Four years in a row of deficit reduction under this President, for the first time in any administration since the 1840's. Let me repeat that. Not the 1940's; this is the first administration since the 1840's that has delivered 4 years in a row of deficit reduction. Not only did the President deliver on his promise of deficit reduction, he also delivered on his promise of creating jobs in this country. He promised 8 million jobs. We have now had more than 10 million created in the 3\\1/2\\ years of this administration. The President did not stop there. He also promised to reduce the Federal payroll by 100,000. The most recent numbers indicate that he has reduced the Federal work force by 230,000. So, in each of these areas where this President made a direct promise to the American people of what he would achieve, that is what has happened. Deficit reduction; he said he would cut it by 50 percent. He has cut the deficit by 60 percent. The President said he would be part of an administration that would have a strategy that would create 8 million new jobs. They have created over 10 million new jobs in the 3\\1/2\\ years of this administration. The President said he would reduce the Federal payroll by 100,000. He has reduced the Federal payroll by nearly a quarter of a million, 230,000. I think it is important, when we have these political debates, that we be direct and clear with the American people as to what has happened. The fact is, the Clinton record on deficits is an admirable one. The Senator from New Mexico may quibble about how he has achieved it, but there can be no question about the results. The deficit this year, the Congressional Budget Office says, will be between $115 and $130 billion. That is a dramatic improvement for this country. In fact, measured against the size of our economy, these are the smallest deficits in over 20 years, as measured by the share of our economy. We now anticipate that the deficit this year will be 1.6 percent of the size of our economy, lower than any year since 1974. In fact, we now have the smallest deficits of any major economy in the world as a share of our gross domestic product. In 1992, the last year of the Bush administration, the United States had a larger budget deficit as a share of the economy than Japan, Germany and France. In fact, we can all remember that we were embarrassed when we went to the international meetings on the economy and were on the defensive because of the size of our budget deficits. This year, when our President went to the international meetings of the economic leaders of the major industrialized countries, the United States was in the best position of any of the major economies in the world. This President was able to proudly say that we had not only cut our deficit in half in dollar terms, but we had reduced the deficit even more significantly when measured against the size of the economy. This chart demonstrates what I am talking about with respect to the deficit as measured as a percentage of the gross domestic product, or, put perhaps more understandably, as measured against the size of our economy. President Reagan came in and inherited a budget deficit that was just below 3 percent, in terms measured against the size of our entire economy. During the Reagan years the deficits absolutely skyrocketed up to over 6 percent of the size of our economy. They saw a reduction back down to over 3 percent when President Bush took over and then, once again, they took off. They took off to a level of about 5 percent, deficits that were running 5 percent of our gross domestic product. Under President Clinton, the deficit, as measured against the size of our economy, has gone down each and every year. This chart shows it at under 2 percent. The news today is even better than that. It indicates that the deficit this year, as measured against the size of our economy, will be about 1.6 percent, somewhere right in here on the chart. Those are the facts. I do not mind criticism of this President or any other President with respect to their record. But this is the Clinton record, and this is the record of the previous Presidents--President Reagan and President Bush. They were the kings of deficits. We had the larger deficits, historically, under those Republican administrations. I might add, Republicans also controlled the Senate from 1980 to 1986. Those are the years when the deficits absolutely skyrocketed out of control. Interestingly enough, it is when we had President Clinton and Democratic control of the Senate and Democratic control of the House of Representatives that we saw the sharpest reduction in the budget deficit in this period. This chart follows three Presidents, two Republicans, one Democrat. This is a period in which the Republicans controlled the U.S. Senate for 6 years. This is a time when Democrats, for 2 years, controlled the Presidency, the Senate of the United States and the House of Representatives. During that period we finally got on a course of dramatic reduction of the budget deficits, whether we measure it in dollar terms or measure it against the size of the economy. In either case, we saw dramatic progress. Those are the facts. No chart that shows how the deficits were reduced, how they were produced, can change the hard reality and the hard fact that this President delivered on his promise, that this President has produced 4 years in a row of deficit reduction, the best record of any administration for over 150 years. That is the reality, and this President deserves the credit. I might also add this President is the first one in 17 years to submit a Congressional Budget Office- certified balanced budget. My friends on the other side of the aisle are quick to claim credit for the deficit reduction which has occurred. I remind them that none of their plans would balance without the plan that passed in 1993 with only Democratic votes in this Chamber and in the other Chamber and with the support of this President. Not a single Republican voted for that deficit reduction plan that put us on this path. Talk is cheap. It is tough to actually cast the votes that lead to this result. This result is clear, and this result is important to the economic future of this country. The other point I think needs to be made is the suggestion by the Senator from New Mexico that this has only occurred because of tax increases. I say to my colleague, he may have forgotten that the 1993 budget plan that passed here not only had tax increases, tax increases that were aimed at the wealthiest 1 percent in this country, but also substantial spending cuts. And, again, the record is clear. If we look at spending as a share of the gross domestic product, we saw that spending under President Bush increased from 22.1 percent of the gross domestic product to 23.3 percent. Under this administration, spending as a share of the economy has declined from that 23.3 to 21.7 percent, and that takes us to a lower level than at any time during the previous two administrations. That might come as a surprise and a shock to some who want to portray the Democrats as the spenders. The fact is, the Democrats, in the plan that they passed in 1993, not only reduced the deficit but also reduced spending as a share of our national economy to the lowest level that we have had in the last three administrations, down from 23.3 percent of our national economy to 21.7 percent of our national economy today--the lowest spending level in the last three administrations. Mr. President, we can debate a lot of things, but the record with respect to deficits is clear. In the previous administrations, headed by President Reagan and President Bush, the deficit skyrocketed, the highest deficits we have ever had in our history. Under the administration of President Clinton, the deficit has been cut by 60 percent, exceeding h","word.count":2217,"sep11":-5.28932584269663,"years":1996.5702247191,"days":559,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.182647689302231,"Topic 2":0.0127498022982867,"Topic 3":0.0135088882381434,"Topic 4":0.246799425040984,"Topic 5":0.058262093156531,"Topic 6":0.00335704177195144,"Topic 7":0.00253289068766241,"Topic 8":0.433529493772751,"Topic 9":0.0032645580268324,"Topic 10":0.0433481177046262},{"id":"10419960046528","body":"Phil Gramm: Mr. President, 50 years ago today Winston Churchill came to America to a tiny college in the middle of the Midwest--to Westminster College--and gave a speech that awakened America and the world to a crisis. We all know that speech. We all remember it from our childhood, or reading about it in history books. He talked about the descending of an iron curtain across the face of Europe. And, while the cold war was already underway, that speech probably more than anything else awakened America and the world to the Soviet threat. We started to respond with the policy of containment. We responded by building up NATO and SEATO. We responded by fighting in Korea and Vietnam. We responded with the Marshall plan and the Truman plan to expand trade and work toward free trade. Our policies won the cold war, tore down the Berlin Wall, liberated Eastern Europe, and transformed the Soviet Union. We won one of the greatest victories in the history of mankind. But there still is important unfinished business from the cold war. Communist China is in transition, and so is Vietnam. But there are two Communist regimes on this planet that are totally unchanged, that still believe in Marxism and Leninism, that still are committed to everything that we oppose in the world. One of those regimes is the military dictatorship in North Korea. The other is Fidel Castro's Cuba. For 3 years, Bill Clinton has coddled both of those regimes. We have a policy in place today to give, through an international consortium, $4 billion to North Korea to build for them two nuclear powerplants even though there is no evidence whatsoever that either of the existing nuclear powerplants in North Korea was ever used to generate a watt of electricity or ever had any purpose other than building nuclear weapons. We are today supplying oil through that consortium to North Korea and propping up a Communist regime. President Clinton for 3 years has coddled Fidel Castro. He announced a policy last year that enforced the imprisonment of the Cuban people-- that actually used the United States Navy to enforce the imprisonment of the Cuban people. The United States Navy was given the assignment by the President of the United States to pick up people who risk their lives to flee Communist oppression from Cuba, put them in American naval vessels, and then turn those people back over to Fidel Castro. The President set out a policy that opened the door for nongovernment organizations to establish a presence in Cuba and in the process started what Fidel Castro believed, and the world believed, was a movement toward normalization. Voices were raised in Congress in opposition to the President's policy. Both the distinguished Senator from Georgia and I spoke out against it, as did many others. We now see the fruit of that policy, and the fruit of that policy is that Fidel Castro brutally murdered four Americans. We have the tapes of the communications from the MiG's as they talked to their home base, identifying civilian planes with no armament. We have the tapes of those conversations when they then boasted how they were going to destroy these planes. On an order from their home base, they fired the missiles that killed four American citizens. We are now considering a bill to change our relationship with Castro's Cuba and bring it back to what it has always been; that is, a policy of strong opposition.","word.count":581,"sep11":-5.66292134831461,"years":1996.19662921348,"days":426,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.011477472717025,"Topic 2":0.0164484138163212,"Topic 3":0.0226391233549921,"Topic 4":0.0563397906091507,"Topic 5":0.0335163531868797,"Topic 6":0.00222224180892498,"Topic 7":0.00137096146236808,"Topic 8":0.620315824179695,"Topic 9":0.0506778352953889,"Topic 10":0.184991983569254},{"id":"11020070054531","body":"Timothy H. Bishop: Mr. President, it has been more than a week since the Democratic nominee for President, the junior Senator from Illinois, responded to high gas prices by saying it wasn't high gas prices he minded but the fact that people didn't have time to get used to them. In his words, he would have preferred a ``gradual adjustment'' to a sudden jolt. As I said last week, I can't imagine this is a view many other people share, certainly not the people of Kentucky, who I assure you are not at all interested in getting used to $4-a-gallon gas, however gradual the adjustment. Our Democratic colleagues on the other side of the aisle have had a week to demonstrate they do not embrace the ``gradual adjustment'' philosophy of their nominee. We haven't heard a word from any of them. Maybe they don't have a problem with $4-a-gallon gasoline either. Maybe the junior Senator from North Dakota was speaking for all of them when he said over the weekend that $4-a-gallon gasoline was finally forcing people to conserve. Telling people whose livelihoods depend on getting to and from work that they should get used to high gas prices is not an energy policy. Supporting a gradual adjustment to $4-a-gallon gasoline is not an energy policy. Americans need an energy policy befitting America, and that means using the natural resources we have here at home to bring down prices in the short term, while pursuing a long-term strategy for energy independence through clean technologies. We can do both, and we should do both. We need more American energy now. That is the short-term solution to the current crisis.

Langevin: Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5749, the Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2008, which will provide 13 weeks of extended unemployment compensation benefits for all workers who have exhausted their current 26 weeks of benefits. This measure also provides 13 additional weeks for workers in States with unemployment rates of 6 percent or higher. In order to receive these benefits, workers must have lost a job through no fault of their own, be actively searching for a job, be able to work, and must have a minimum number of weeks worked and amount of wages earned over a specific timeframe prior to being unemployed. This bill provides a critical boost to the many Rhode Islanders, and Americans across the Nation, who are struggling to find employment. Our country's unemployment rate jumped from 5 percent in April to 5.5 percent in May, the biggest one-month increase in over 20 years. In my home State of Rhode Island, the unemployment rate reached 6.1 percent in April, and we have lost an estimated 6,300 jobs since the beginning of the year. H.R. 5749 would provide relief through March 2006 and benefit 3.8 million Americans. Most importantly, this measure would immediately help as many as 8,000 Rhode Islanders. When discussing this matter, we must remember to look beyond the statistics and recognize the serious toll that unemployment is taking on American families. I have received numerous calls from my fellow Rhode Islanders asking when Congress would extend their benefits. They tell me how they are looking for a job, but they just have not been able to find one yet. They have not given up--research has shown that workers who exhaust their unemployment benefits, search for a job at similar or higher levels of intensity as those who find employment before their benefits expire--but they need more time. Compounding the problem, the rising cost of gas poses an additional challenge in searching for a job, and rising food prices have made it even harder to put food on the table. Our constituents are turning to us for help. As Members of Congress, we have the power to give hard-working Americans another chance to continue their job search and provide for their families. Our country has faced economic hardships and recessions before, and I have no doubt we will weather this current downturn. I encourage my colleagues to pass this bill and give a hand up to those who are most vulnerable during these trying times.","word.count":416,"sep11":6.92415730337079,"years":2008.78370786517,"days":4907,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0479569951163586,"Topic 2":0.0648594141806935,"Topic 3":0.00698505868681786,"Topic 4":0.00789612085325427,"Topic 5":0.00750933151142247,"Topic 6":0.03881595766889,"Topic 7":0.00551735718633447,"Topic 8":0.154175823827601,"Topic 9":0.201303277789436,"Topic 10":0.464980663179192},{"id":"10820030075698","body":"Arlen Specter: Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Illinois on the importance of fighting HIV/AIDS.

Three years ago, Aileen was appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. During her time in Washington, I worked with Aileen and OVC on a number of matters and came to know Aileen as a dedicated advocate for crime victims. Her vision and dedication have been extraordinary. Aileen will be sincerely missed, although her legacy will benefit victims of crime for years to come. Before coming to the Department of Justice, Aileen had served as the legal counsel for the Rape Treatment Center at Santa Monica Hospital for 10 years. In that position, Aileen demonstrated her leadership and innovation with the creation of Stuart House, an interagency center for sexually-abused children. As Director of OVC, Aileen focused on assisting local and state crime victim programs around the country and improving crime victims services in the federal system. Aileen's leadership has helped over two million crime victims across the country and around the globe. In just this past year, OVC has administered over $528 million and supported more than 2,500 victim assistance programs. Aileen's dedication has impacted rural areas such as Vermont. She has helped sharpen the focus on rural crime and domestic violence and supported a rural crime initiative which will study and enhance services available to rural crime victims. Among the victim assistance programs pioneered by Aileen was the establishment of the National Victim Assistance Academy last year. This Academy provides training on victims' rights and services and draws upon expertise of professionals ranging from law enforcement officers to rape crises counselors. Over 200 victim advocates and professionals have graduated from the Academy and have taken their skills back to their communities, where they continue outreach work for the benefit of victims. Under her leadership, a group of international experts joined to draft a manual to implement the United Nations Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power. Among other things, this manual is a step toward ensuring that crime victims are treated fairly and that they are assisted throughout the globe. I had the opportunity to work with Aileen and the many dedicated members of her staff on a number of matters over the last few years. In the aftermath of the bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Aileen and OVC were among those immediately on the scene to provide assistance to the victims. Together we have found ways to extend and expand that victims assistance over time and to enact legislation to allow victims and their families greater opportunity to attend and observe the trials of those charged in connection with that horrendous crime. We worked together on the Victims of Terrorism Act that I added to the bill passed by the Senate in June 1995, in the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing, to improve our law recognizing the rights and needs of victims of crime. We also worked on the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act that was enacted in April 1996. We were able to make funds available through supplemental grants to the States to assist and compensate victims of terrorism and mass violence, which incidents might otherwise have overwhelmed the resources of Oklahoma's crime victims compensation program or its victims assistance services. We also filled a gap in our law for residents of the United States who are victims of terrorism and mass violence that occur outside the borders of the United States. In addition, we allowed greater flexibility to our State and local victims' assistance programs and some greater certainty so that they can know that our commitment to victims programming will not wax and wane with events. Accordingly, we enacted an important provision to increase the base amounts for States' victims assistance grants to $500,000 and allowed victims assistance grants to be made for a 3-year cycle of programming, rather than the year of award plus one, which was the limit contained in previous law. We were able to raise the assessments on those convicted of federal crimes in order to fund the needs of crime victims. We worked to improve the church burning legislation and to increase the stability to victim assistance and victim compensation program funds. Aileen was helpful in consulting with me and other Senators on the Judiciary Committee on the victims provisions of S. 15, a youth crime bill, so that the rights of victims of juvenile crime to appear, to be heard and to be informed would be protected. Those provisions have now been incorporated in the juvenile crime bill ordered reported by the Judiciary Committee. In addition, Senator Kennedy and I incorporated a number of her suggestions in S. 1081, the ``Crime Victims Assistance Act.'' That bill would reform the Federal Rules and Federal law to establish additional rights and protections for victims of federal crime. In particular, the legislation would provide crime victims with an enhanced right to be heard on the issue of pretrial detention, on plea bargains, at sentencing, on probation revocation, and to be notified of a defendant's escape or release from prison. The legislation goes further than other victims rights proposals that are currently before Congress by including enhanced penalties for witness intimidation, an increase in Federal victim assistance personnel, enhanced training for State and local law enforcement and officers of the Court, development of state of the art systems for notifying victims of important dates and developments in their cases, and the establishment of ombudsman programs for crime victims. I know that crime victim advocates in Vermont join me in thanking Aileen for her service. I was delighted that Aileen could come to Vermont to keynote the restorative justice conference in Vermont last June. Our Vermont advocates are well aware of the extraordinary efforts at OVC and have worked with OVC to create greater opportunities for rural programs. With support from OVC, Vermont has been able to implement its victims programs for outreach to underserved populations and coordinate among providers and allied professionals. I was especially proud when the recent site visit to Vermont resulted in the Justice Department concluding that ``Vermont's programs are setting the standard for outreach to under served populations and service coordination among providers and allied professionals.'' Aileen Adams has dedicated her service to the needs of crime victims. She has made a difference. She has improved federal programs for victims of domestic violence, victims of terrorism, and crime victim assistance generally. She has helped create a strong funding source for crime victim compensation and assistance programs. She has worked to expand crime victims rights. Most importantly, she has made a difference in the lives of crime victims all across the country.","word.count":1141,"sep11":-3.4747191011236,"years":1998.38483146067,"days":1205,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0866129690882235,"Topic 2":0.0150274663870836,"Topic 3":0.0271557889134661,"Topic 4":0.110139302761837,"Topic 5":0.00434800963893161,"Topic 6":0.524659030657359,"Topic 7":0.0262204083103505,"Topic 8":0.186676886041411,"Topic 9":0.0136222568933859,"Topic 10":0.00553788130795081},{"id":"10519980089634","body":"Kent Conrad: Mr. President, I rise today to thank the conferees who worked on the fiscal year 1999 omnibus appropriations bill for retention of my amendment calling for inclusion of North Dakota in the Midwest High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, or HIDTA. As North Dakota Attorney General Heidi Heitkamp and US Attorney John Schneider have pointed out, North Dakota--like other Midwestern states--has been inundated by a relentlessly rising tide of methamphetamine trafficking, production, and abuse. Unless action is taken swiftly, the Attorney General and US Attorney warn that North Dakota is at high risk to attract a meth manufacturing industry. This is because my state's sparse population, great size, and abandoned buildings offer excellent locations for meth laboratories. Counter-drug operations in the southwestern US are also forcing this easily-relocated industry to find alternative production locations. The numbers speak for themselves. There were no meth purchases by undercover agents in North Dakota in 1993. By 1997, there were 181 meth-related cases reported by state and federal law enforcement. In 1993, meth-related cases represented only 6 percent of the drug-related workload of the Office of the US Attorney. In five short years this number has skyrocketed to 75 percent. It is undeniable that increased production of meth in North Dakota along with associated trafficking has contributed to a spike of violent crime. This unacceptable increase in meth-driven crime in North Dakota is placing a growing burden on North Dakota law enforcement, and represents a growing danger to the people of my state. It demands an immediate--and coordinated--federal response. Similar problems in the states of South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri, and Kansas were countered with the formation of the Midwest HIDTA. North Dakota meets all the statutory criteria for inclusion in the Midwest HIDTA. In the words of Heitkamp and Schneider, joining the HIDTA will allow federal, state, and local law enforcement to ``work together to disrupt, dismantle, and destroy street and mid-level elements of methamphetamine organizations and/or groups operating in North Dakota, the Midwest, and Canada.'' During floor consideration of the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill, I was pleased to work on this matter with the distinguished leadership of the Treasury-Postal Appropriations Subcommittee, Senators Campbell and Kohl. I greatly appreciate their good work in conference to retain my amendment. I am also pleased that the conference report includes additional funding for the new HIDTAs designated in this legislation, and I urge the Administration to consider favorably North Dakota's request for $1.97 million in fiscal year 1999 funding for integration of my state into the Midwest HIDTA. Mr. President, passage of the omnibus bill is an important step in getting tough on methamphetamine in my state. It is simply imperative that there be coordinated federal, state, and local law enforcement response to North Dakota's drug crisis, and I again thank Senators Campbell and Kohl for their assistance in making this a reality.","word.count":475,"sep11":-2.96629213483146,"years":1998.89325842697,"days":1386,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0788326757757186,"Topic 2":0.0828058250381694,"Topic 3":0.0479216900253304,"Topic 4":0.0359686225858302,"Topic 5":0.0914581704538175,"Topic 6":0.00550168625275907,"Topic 7":0.00472634238197165,"Topic 8":0.48501521106204,"Topic 9":0.00771797785476367,"Topic 10":0.160051798569599},{"id":"11020070005518","body":"Michael C.

We are here today because the majority chooses not to allow a vote on a minimum wage. It is that simple. That is wrong. It is wrong because the millions of hard-working Americans making the minimum wage deserve a raise. It is wrong because the Senators from California and Massachusetts also deserve to get a vote on their amendment. It is not right that a person who has a full- time job at minimum wage still has to live in poverty, but that is where we are today in America. For a family of three, let's say a mom and two kids, the gap between the poverty line and the minimum wage is $3,681. That is right, a family would need $3,681 more just to get up to the poverty level, and that is before taking into account the cost of child care, which is a big factor, or the cost of gasoline for the car--we know how much gasoline prices are rising--or the cost of clothes for a job. Often a person has to buy separate clothes for a job. If we want people to be able to move off welfare and into work--and that is what we want, people off welfare into work--we have to make sure the work they get pays enough so they can get off welfare and lift them out of poverty. That is what we have to do, and that is why increasing the minimum wage is so important. Most people who are on welfare will say they want to get off welfare; they do not like it; they hate it. That is what they tell me. I have talked to a lot of people on welfare. One of the main reasons they will say it is so difficult to get off welfare is because the job that pays at minimum wage does not pay enough for them to get by. I have heard that countless times. They are working full time but they cannot make ends meet. We need to raise the minimum wage to help people get off welfare. The vote today is also about another point. The Senators from California and Massachusetts deserve at least to have a vote on their amendment. They are willing to enter into a short time agreement. They are not delaying. They say, sure, let's have a vote on their amendment, with a short time agreement. They are not delaying. It is the other side which is preventing them from having a vote. We on this side of the aisle do not wish to delay this bill. We are willing to work to get a finite list of amendments. We are willing to enter into a time agreement on amendments. We are not asking for anything out of the ordinary. I remind my colleagues that during the 13-day period for which the Senate considered the basic bill, the 1995 welfare bill, September 7 to September 19 of 1995, the Senate conducted 43 rollcall votes on amendments. So far this year we have conducted one, and yet there is a cloture motion to try to stop debate. That is not the way to legislate. We are not asking for anything out of the ordinary. We merely ask that Senators be able to offer amendments and get votes on their amendments. We have time agreements, we have lists, and so forth. That is what this debate is about. I urge my colleagues to uphold the rights of Senators. I urge Senators to vote to increase the minimum wage. I urge Senators to oppose cloture.

As many of our colleagues are aware, an explosion rocked the Kentucky Darby Mine No. 1 around 1:30 Saturday morning. According to news reports, the blast occurred nearly a mile underground near a sealed-off area of the mine. The force of the explosion was so powerful it caused damage over 5,000 feet up at the mine opening. Five miners were killed. Their families are, of course, completely devastated, and the entire community is struggling for answers in the face of such a catastrophe, an unexpected tragedy that is so overwhelming it breaks your heart and almost leaves you numb. There is one ray of light in this otherwise very dark episode. One miner, a man named Paul Ledford of Dayhoit, KY, managed to escape the blast. He was injured but reportedly was still able to walk out of the mine on his own two feet. After a short stay in the hospital, he was released, and I am sure his family is thrilled that he survived the catastrophe. The Darby mine explosion brings this year's total number of deaths from mining accidents in Kentucky to 10, double what it was just 72 hours ago. Thank goodness Paul Ledford's name is not on that list. But these Kentuckians' names are: Paris Thomas, Jr., 53, of Closplint; George William Petra, 49, of Kenvir; Jimmy B. Lee, 33, of Wallins Creek; Amon ``Cotton'' Brock, 51, of Closplint; and Roy Middleton, 35, of Evarts. All were lost in this explosion Saturday. The Harlan County coroner's report indicates that Amon Brock and Jimmy Lee were killed instantly by the tremendous force of the explosion. The other three survived long enough to put on breathing devices, but still died of carbon monoxide poisoning. Their loved ones will never forget the last time they saw them before they descended into the mines. Nor will they forget the calamity that, sadly, added their names to this list. Neither should we ever forget them. The authorities are still investigating the cause of this accident. Some accidents are, unfortunately, entirely unpreventable. But other accidents are all the more horrific because they could have been prevented. When it comes to the second type, this Senate can and must act to prevent them. The list of Kentucky mining deaths is too long already. I am sure my colleagues, Senator Rockefeller and Senator Byrd, will agree that the list of West Virginia names is too long as well. Every American watched the terrible events at the Sago mine this past January, when 12 miners were killed. The Senate should act quickly by passing S. 2803, the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006, of which, I am happy to say, I am a cosponsor. This measure, drafted by Senators Enzi and Kennedy, was unanimously reported out of the HELP Committee last week, and the Senate should move expeditiously to pass this legislation. It is the most comprehensive package of miner-safety legislation in a generation. Once it is fully implemented, the brave men and women who descend in the darkness to provide the rest of us with light and heat will have safer working conditions than ever before. The MINER Act, as it is called, will require mining companies to submit to the Mine Safety and Health Administration, MSHA, up-to-date emergency preparedness and response plans. The plans must be adapted to each individual mine, and MSHA must review and recertify them every 6 months. As conditions change, so must the response plans in order to best protect our miners. The bill will require the mining companies to put in place state-of- the-art, two-way wireless communications and electronic tracking systems. Mine rescue team response will be both faster and safer. The bill will require every miner to have at least 2 hours of oxygen on hand and stores of oxygen to be stashed every 30 minutes along escape routes for evacuating miners. Randal McCloy, Jr., the only miner who survived the Sago tragedy, has reported that at least four of his fellow miners' air packs were faulty, leaving the team without enough air. Given the fact that three of the miners in the Darby mine died with their breathing masks on, it seems the same thing happened yet again in Kentucky this weekend. That is unacceptable and must not be tolerated. The bill will give the Secretary of Labor new, stronger enforcement powers to ensure the mines are in compliance. The Secretary will have the authority to shut down a mine for failing to meet the Department's orders, and the bill raises penalties significantly for serious violations. The bill will also clarify that mine safety rescue teams are not liable for any injuries or deaths that may happen due to rescue activities. This is important because up to now, some mining companies have hesitated to have mine rescue teams for fear of being sued. This provision of the bill will ensure the mining companies have the incentive to put a mine rescue team in place. Finally, the bill will create grant programs to improve safety training, direct studies of safety techniques, and create an interagency group to facilitate the development of new safety technologies and activities. I understand this may not be the perfect bill. Not everyone has gotten everything in it they want. But it represents the best, most comprehensive approach to this problem in many years. In fact, both the National Mining Association and the United Mine Workers of America have endorsed it. That ought to tell you something right there. These two groups don't agree on things very often, so I am sure my colleagues can see how their agreement is a signal that the MINER Act is the breakthrough that we have been waiting for. It is too late for us to do anything for the five Kentucky miners who died this Saturday. Right now the healing for their families and that community is happening in Harlan County. I was touched by an article I read today about a memorial service that took place at the Closplint Church of God in Clospint, KY, just 10 miles down the road from the Darby mine. The Rev. Frank Howard led a prayer for the victims' families. He said, ``We're a coal community, and we need to lift each other up.'' I know the people of Harlan County well. And I am sure of this: They certainly do have the strength to lift each other up in this hour of anguish. And when they need help, they will get it. It will pour in from every corner of Kentucky and beyond. So we here in the Nation's Capital must also do our part. When this Government acts swiftly and with purpose, we can uplift the fortunes of many who may otherwise be cursed to suffer in despair. By passing this legislation, we can lessen the burden on others who work in the mines and their families by letting them know that we are listening and doing everything we can. It is my understanding that efforts are underway on both sides to get this legislation cleared, we hope, as soon as tomorrow. But there is one other thing we ought to do. I was looking at the Executive Calendar. I noticed that the MSHA, the Mine Safety and Health Administration, is without a Director, and not because the HELP Committee has not acted. On March 8, 2006, the HELP Committee reported out an individual from West Virginia to be Director of the Mine Safety and Health Administration. His nomination has been languishing on the calendar for 2\\1/2\\ months. I can't think of a worse time to have MSHA without a permanent Director than now. We have had a raft of coal mine deaths this year in West Virginia and Kentucky. With coal production up and coal prices up, it is a virtual certainty that more and more coal is going to be mined. Therefore, more and more miners will be involved in mining coal. We need a permanent Director of MSHA, and we need to pass the legislation I hope we will pass tomorrow. I know there has been a hold on the MSHA Director nomination on the other side of the aisle. I have been told that there will be an objection yet again today. But I want to plead with those from the other side who may believe that this is not the perfect nominee--he is the nominee, nominated by the President, reported out of the HELP Committee. If he were to be drawn down and this whole process were to be started all over again, we wouldn't have an MSHA Director for months and months into the future. We need a permanent Director of the Mine Safety and Health Administration. Bearing that in mind, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to executive session for the consideration of Calendar No. 553, the nomination of Richard Stickler of West Virginia to be the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Mine Safety and Health; provided further that the nomination be confirmed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate resume legislative session. Before the Chair rules, as I have indicated already, let me say again, this nominee has been reported out of the HELP Committee. He has been on the calendar since March 8 of this year. MSHA is without a permanent Director, and I would hope that my unanimous consent request will not be objected to.","word.count":1614,"sep11":4.81460674157303,"years":2006.67415730337,"days":4156,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0354853771793897,"Topic 2":0.200241567900479,"Topic 3":0.0367867282159915,"Topic 4":0.0208126193923962,"Topic 5":0.517960870771369,"Topic 6":0.0304883726465293,"Topic 7":0.0240811946458563,"Topic 8":0.06652303337091,"Topic 9":0.00287051766708303,"Topic 10":0.0647497182099956},{"id":"10920060012588","body":"Rush Holt: Mr. Chairman, I rise in reluctant support of the Energy and Water Appropriations bill that we are considering today. The Energy and Water bill funds our Nation's Department of Energy programs, water and science programs and some defense and agriculture related programs. Unfortunately, instead of making a commitment to a rational energy policy this bill continues our dependence on fossil fuels; continues our practice of poisoning our lands, oceans, and air; and does little to combat rising gas prices. While H.R. 5427 does increase funding for alternative energy research and development, we must do more. I was pleased to learn that energy supply and conservation programs are funded at $2 billion, 5 percent more than the President's request and 12 percent more than the current level. Important initiatives that will receive additional funding are renewable energy and energy efficiency programs; including biomass fuels, hydrogen technologies and solar power. Appropriations bills are a chance for Congress to fund programs that we believe fit our Nation's goals and protect the best interests of the American people. In this bill, we must show our commitment to important programs that promote sustainable energy sources, energy efficiency, and eliminate our dependence on foreign oil. We can and should do better than what we are considering today. That is why I supported the Visclosky amendment which would have invested $750 million in alternative energy, innovation, and energy efficiency by increasing funding for the Biomass and Biorefinery Systems Research and Development and various other technologies such as clean coal and geothermal research and development. Tomorrow we will consider a bill once again that will allow drilling the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. I wonder when my colleagues will learn that drilling our way to energy independence is unrealistic and simply flawed logic. We must focus on developing sustainable energy sources and encouraging conservation. This is the only way to actually work our way to energy independence. I urge my colleagues to make a commitment to alternative energy sources. Ernest Hemingway wrote, ``The world is a fine place and worth fighting for.'' We must continue to fight to preserve our environment and develop energy sources that are clean, safe and sustainable.","word.count":362,"sep11":4.82022471910112,"years":2006.6797752809,"days":4158,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0646866043979657,"Topic 2":0.0193601975872818,"Topic 3":0.312574351097022,"Topic 4":0.0163668462710063,"Topic 5":0.0343542323333107,"Topic 6":0.00881342177952553,"Topic 7":0.00202861086637527,"Topic 8":0.0422283901866561,"Topic 9":0.00508724749259318,"Topic 10":0.494500097988263},{"id":"11020080027018","body":"Jason Altmire: I appreciate the gentleman from Connecticut And the gentleman from Florida talked about the difference between the freedom that we all enjoy to say things on the floor and the responsibility that we have to quote facts, to use real numbers. And the people on the other side who come down here on occasion I would say are very good at the PR aspect of the job, at getting the message out and in trying to undermine the message that we put out. We think about this drilling issue, we think about the Outer Continental Shelf, and we think about the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, ANWR, and we say, well, the numbers that they're using on the other side may not be as accurate as they could be. They might be overstating the situation a little bit, both with regard to the time necessary to get that oil, but more importantly, the amount of oil that's there at all. And the pushback that we get from the other side is often, oh, those are Democratic talking points, and they don't know what they're talking about, and we're not going to listen to them because they're Democrats and they're just reading talking points. So I wanted to read a quote from someone, and then I'm going to put the source of the quote up. This is from a hearing that was held yesterday here on Capitol Hill, because we're working every day to try to figure out what we can do on a daily basis to bring the price of gasoline down in the short term and the long term. And a hearing was held, and one of the witnesses said this: ``They mislead the public''--talking about the big oil companies and the proponents of opening up ANWR and new areas of the Outer Continental Shelf is who this gentleman is referring to. ``They mislead the public. And the public thinks, well, if we've got 86 billion barrels of oil sitting out there, why don't we just go drill it and produce it and lower the price of gasoline? We can lower it to $2 a gallon. That's the way it's been characterized, which I think is totally misleading. Experts are way off when they say there's 86 billion barrels of oil off the coast. That number is way overstated. They also talk about ANWR having 16 billion. I think the number there is a lot closer to 2 billion. That's all you can get out of there. I don't see any fuel that's going to replace gasoline and diesel except natural gas.'' Well, is that a Democratic talking point? That's basically what we've been saying for the last several months, but no, that was not a Democrat that said that, that was none other than an oilman, and certainly not someone historically who has been very complimentary of Democratic policies, Mr. T. Boone Pickens, somebody who understands the oil industry in this country. That's what he said. And I would ask my colleagues if they've seen the commercials that he's running on TV. And the slogan that he uses is, ``We can't drill our way out of this problem.'' And this is the quote that I read. So we have validation from sources that understand the oil industry and understand that this is more than just a political hot button issue that we can use to score cheap political points. This is the biggest problem facing the country. And we have to come together as Republicans and Democrats and do everything we possibly can to work on short-term solutions and long-term solutions to solve this energy crisis. And it's going to take all hands on deck. And the quicker that we move away from the cheap political points and trying to play one- upmanship on the rhetoric, the better chance we're going to have of solving this problem. So I would yield to the gentleman from Florida .","word.count":658,"sep11":7.04213483146067,"years":2008.90168539326,"days":4949,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.746514949327888,"Topic 2":0.0844070894213396,"Topic 3":0.0183637780457605,"Topic 4":0.0390154274246368,"Topic 5":0.0187238754093806,"Topic 6":0.0175150798849644,"Topic 7":0.0146157205104219,"Topic 8":0.0319025652509988,"Topic 9":0.0203689196321107,"Topic 10":0.00857259509249873},{"id":"10620000042121","body":"Carrie Meek: Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to revise and extend my remarks.

All of us know that we must act now or we lose what is left of the Everglades within a few years. No one disputes that the Federal Government is largely responsible for the damage that was done to the Everglades. Fifty years ago, the Federal Government established the Everglades National Park but simultaneously, a series of canals, levees and other flood control structures constructed by the Southern and Central Florida Project disrupted the life-blood of the Everglades--the flow of clean fresh water. As a result of these 50 years of neglect and abuse, the State of Florida has lost 46 percent of its wetlands and 50 percent of its historic Everglades ecosystem. Sixty-eight plant and animal species have become threatened or endangered with extinction while urban and agricultural runoff have produced extensive water quality degradation throughout the region. The Federal Government has a clear interest in restoring this ecosystem since a large portion of the lands owned or managed by the Federal Government will receive the benefits of the restoration--4 national parks and 16 national wildlife refuges which make up half of the remaining Everglades. The need for action is clear. That is why I am so pleased that we are coming together to solve this problem. The legislation before us today represents an unprecedented compromise supported by the administration, the State of Florida, environmental groups, farmers, home builders, water utilities, Indian tribes and industry. These diverse groups represent every major constituency involved in the Everglades restoration. And they are all on board. Not because they all got what they wanted, but because they all understood the urgency of passing this legislation to save America's Everglades. Mr. Speaker, America desperately needs this bill. I urge all my colleagues to join me to preserve America's Everglades and to ensure that one of the world's most endangered ecosystems is not lost.","word.count":364,"sep11":-0.876404494382023,"years":2000.98314606742,"days":2130,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0264289871362001,"Topic 2":0.153493334976359,"Topic 3":0.00505462908255005,"Topic 4":0.00269166284568123,"Topic 5":0.0267569301085203,"Topic 6":0.408462985946438,"Topic 7":0.00252523816227217,"Topic 8":0.324499500669882,"Topic 9":0.0341991712916658,"Topic 10":0.0158875597804312},{"id":"10519970017772","body":"Rodney Frelinghuysen: Mr. Speaker, President Clinton seems like he is absolutely committed on this upcoming trip to China. We have asked him to reconsider this trip and, no, he will not reconsider the trip. And Congress officially asked him whether or not he would at least attempt not to do something in Tiananmen Square which would then make a mockery of the human rights commitments of this country by holding some sort of meeting with people who murdered hundreds if not thousands of human rights activists at that very same location 10 years ago. But, again, we were rebuffed in that request as well. The President of the United States as the President of the world's leading democracy will visit, then, the world's leading human rights abuser, the world's most powerful totalitarian regime. Well, this President does have an excuse. Yes, in the past President Reagan visited China and so did President Bush. But in the past when Presidents have visited China, I think it is important for us to understand that China at that time was in a transition, or going through changes that made it appear that China would someday evolve out of its dictatorship. And thus it is all right to visit a country that is not free, but it seems to be going in the right direction in that its government is permitting more freedoms. Unfortunately that is not the case for this Presidential visit. China, since the killings at Tiananmen Square, has become even more tyrannical, and more belligerent, and more aggressive and has more power to commit aggression against its neighbors. Spokesmen for the administration say that the President will be calling for a strategic partnership with this Communist regime. Well, naturally calling for a strategic partnership with this totalitarian regime, this powerful totalitarian regime, is causing concern among other countries in that region that are democratic countries. We have already seen the results of the folly of the President's policies. India felt obliged to reaffirm its own nuclear arsenal with an explosion, of a nuclear explosion. The Pakistanis followed. So what we have is an unrest in the subcontinent and a greater chance for conflict, a massive, horrible conflict, between the Pakistanis and the Indians because of this unrest and this proliferation that can be traced right back to the President's China policies. In other words, the world is not as safe as it was. Then we have lesser gangsters in the world like you find in Kosova where you have a murderous regime next door in Serbia thinking that they can go into Kosova and murder people in order to get them to submit. Now why are they doing this? Why does the regime, Milosevic's regime, which was guilty of so many human rights abuses in Bosnia earlier, now feel that they could perhaps do it again? It is because this administration has lost its moral basis, has lost its standing, has lost the principles in which it had so that in which people gave it respect if residing with those principles. There are credible reports from Kosova that indicate that a repeat of the most horrific acts that we have seen in the Balkans is going on right now. Milosevic and his goons, the Serbian dictatorship, the last Communist dictatorship on the continent of Europe, have turned their bloody knives on the people of Kosova especially targeting vulnerable civilian populations for ethnic cleansing, not only in the border areas, but deep into the heartland of Kosova where the people are almost all Albanian, of Albanian extraction. It is incredible that despite the assurances by this administration that their diplomacy is succeeding in calming down Mr. Milosevic and keeping him under control, we are seeing numerous reports of entire villages being wiped out, with the news media discovering pools of blood in the streets of these villages. We have reports from family members of Albanians, men having their throats slit right in front of their families and of indiscriminate artillery bombardment of marketplaces. Mr. Speaker, our government and our European allies should not stand by and wring their hands. We must act forcefully, and we must stand on principle. Unfortunately the pronouncements of this administration as far as tyrants, whether they are big and small, it seems that these pronouncements by this administration are not being taken seriously. We can see in China where they continue their own proliferation of the nuclear technology that we have given them as well as building up their forces, their military forces, and stepping up their opposition and here with a small dictatorship when we face that dictatorship of Milosevic in Serbia. The world is a less safe place because we strayed from our fundamental principles.","word.count":178,"sep11":-4.32584269662921,"years":1997.53370786517,"days":902,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.39290259162578,"Topic 2":0.3537494415988,"Topic 3":0.0117711077547981,"Topic 4":0.0149112735534772,"Topic 5":0.0217163153819179,"Topic 6":0.0714637752459101,"Topic 7":0.0730343561220977,"Topic 8":0.0391554721143851,"Topic 9":0.0160475108047463,"Topic 10":0.00524815579808729},{"id":"11020070007614","body":"Chris Van Hollen: Mr. Speaker, before I discuss the topic upon which I arise to speak, I do want to join my colleagues in celebrating the reauthorization of the United States Fire Administration Act. As a member of the Homeland Security Committee since its origin after 2001, I am a direct witness of the work of our first responders around the Nation. It is important that we recognize the elements of this bill and the funding that is necessary to ensure a system of first responders that works. Yesterday, I met with the chiefs of the fire departments of departments in my State of Texas. I salute them. Through their efforts, we were able to pass this bill. I congratulate the sponsor, and I believe that the National Fire Incident Reporting System improvements that will come about are important; the fire technology assistance and dissemination will be important that is reauthorized; the encouraging of the adoption of standards for firefighter health and safety, one of the ills that we are still dealing with after 9/11, people who have gotten sick after 9/11 and still not addressed; and the coordination on fire service-based emergency medical services is important; and as well, the funding that will come about, upwards of $100 million. Certainly, I encourage them to work with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the work that we can do together. Congratulations on the reauthorization of this bill. I stand as a strong supporter. I rise today, as my colleagues have done, to acknowledge the 40th anniversary of the assassination of Dr. King. That will be tomorrow. I head to Memphis to commemorate that. I just got through speaking to a number of constituents from Texas Southern University and from Prairie View A&M. I asked them about presidential politics. They were thoughtful and discussed with me the balance that they saw in the candidates that happened to be running in the Democratic primary. What I have seen as we watched this debate is really a call on the sensitivities of America, race and gender, and we have seen the tensions and the divisiveness; rather than focus on the message and mission of an American hero like Dr. King, who talked about unity and talked about, as was said by his son today, the horrible evil of racism and poverty and militarism. But even in that voice, he spoke of unity. Today, I rise to call upon the candidates themselves, that whoever will run to the mike first and call upon unity in America may find a surprising response from all the voters, wherever they might be. For Americans are good people. They extend themselves to the battlefields of Afghanistan and Iraq so that others might have freedom and democracy. I might imagine that our soldiers would look back on this divisiveness and the name calling and someone castigating one person because they are for one candidate over another, and ask whether or not we truly understand freedom and democracy. It is choice, it is the ability to make your choice. Yet, it is the ability to come together and unify around the goodness of America. I was glad to hear Majority Whip Clyburn say today that, ``time is neutral.'' As Martin Luther King said, ``It is neutral because it says nothing. It is what you do with it.'' What he reminded us is that people of ill will seem to use time more effectively than people of good will. I truly believe that we have outstanding Americans running for this office. I will be pushing for the one that happens to be in my party, strongly and enthusiastically. But what I will come to this floor and this Congress for is to join me in putting together a reconciliation commission in America. Not just because of the candidacy and the campaigns that we have seen, but because Americans are still sensitive about race and about gender, two groups of people that have been disenfranchised in our history. Yet, we are blessed to be in America, recognizing that many of us have made strides. I am proud to stand here as an African American woman. Some might say I have double issues. But I have double benefits, double celebration. Yet, there are those who I believe would benefit from having this broad discussion, this reconciliation in America about women who were disenfranchised until 1920, woman who suffer from the lack of pay equity, and those who live under a minority umbrella, who themselves still remain discriminated against in schools and jobs and in corporate America. Mr. Speaker, we can benefit from this wonderful debate and discourse between someone who's an African American male with the potential of being the President of the United States and a woman who has the potential of being President of the United States. Why don't we celebrate in that difference and diversity? Why don't we call for unity, because America is greater than our individual differences. As Martin Luther King said, ``It can be the promised land. Why don't we attempt to go there together.''","word.count":724,"sep11":5.57022471910112,"years":2007.4297752809,"days":4425,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0396375936264547,"Topic 2":0.173101078032306,"Topic 3":0.0543838878472296,"Topic 4":0.0680668471317159,"Topic 5":0.158360827118164,"Topic 6":0.198824424852674,"Topic 7":0.0668260946470999,"Topic 8":0.214369625638966,"Topic 9":0.0104236039661167,"Topic 10":0.0160060171392737},{"id":"10419960029795","body":"Jack Kingston: Thank you, Mr. Farr Mr. Speaker, I wanted to talk a little bit in regards to tax relief and economic issues and jobs. I got a call last night from a gentleman, a father from Pennsylvania, had two kids, and I could tell he was a lot like my middle-class friends back home, struggling to make the ends meet. And he just left a message, ``Please keep us in mind; keep working.'' I think about this man. I think about the women I see that are my wife's friends, who are around the neighborhood raising those 3-year- olds, those 5-year-olds. I drive the carpool every Monday when school is in, and when I am driving the carpool, quite often I get out and I talk to people. Mostly it is women. There are a few other dads, but, fortunately, one of the good benefits about this job is we do have some odd hours during the day and we are a little more flexible when we are home. I see these families struggling. They save a little money, but at the end of the month instead of going down to Florida for the weekend, they have to spend it on a new dryer, or they have a car payment, or the house mortgage is payable. And they can manage it, but then they want to do something else to the house, a little modification, or they have to put in a new stove or oven, or something like that, and there is no money at the end of the month. We passed a $500-per-child tax credit. If you had two kids, this gentleman, this family in Pennsylvania, that would have been $1,000 more that they could have. Is that a tax cut for the rich? I do not think so, Mr. Speaker. What that thousand dollars would have meant for this middle-class man is that he and his wife could have bought a few more pairs of tennis shoes, a few more clothes, or maybe they could have gone to another ball game this summer and seen the Philadelphia Phillies do something. It just would have been a good thing for them. That was vetoed. We are going to keep working on that, Mr. Speaker, because that $500-per-child middle-class tax cut is important. Another thing that we have passed is an increased deduction for the home-office tax. In this day and age, with two-income families and high-technology, men and women have an opportunity to work at home. I think of Liz Simpson. She is a neighbor of mine, a friend of mine, an underwriter with an insurance company, and she was able to hook up by modem to her business and stay at home with their little boy, John, and their other child so that she could spend a little more time but also continue earning a living there at home. It gave her a lot of flexibility, and I am glad we increased this home-office tax deduction. We also had a thousand dollar elder deduction so that if your elderly mom or dad, because of medical or economic necessity, has to move in with you, you can deduct up to $1,000, again, helping that sandwich generation, you know the ones who have dependent children and dependent parents. And they are getting squeezed one more time. We need to do things like this for the American middle class. Above all, Mr. Speaker, of course we have to balance that budget. We are paying $20 billion each month interest on the national debt, and that money could be going to education, could be going to health care, could be going to crime prevention. All it is doing is paying the bondholders on the national debt. If we balance the budget, we can bring down interest rates, which would bring down the cost of home mortgages and automobile payments. It would stimulate the economy. On small business entrepreneurs, do my colleagues know, Mr. Speaker, that one-third of the small businesses in America are owned by women? If they could get money cheaper, borrow money at lower interest rates, then these female entrepreneurs could create more jobs, expand their businesses, create more opportunities and in turn earn more and be able to spend more leisure time at home, which is very important to the American family these days. In terms of other family issues, we have got to increase security back home. A friend of mine called me. Obviously, I am not going to mention her name, but this woman was in her house. It was about 10:00 in the morning, mid-morning, washing her 3-year-old. The door bell rang. She goes to the door bell. She sees somebody through the curtain and does not open the door and goes back to the bathroom where she is bathing the baby. The guy kicks in the door, comes in and rapes her. Does not hurt the child, fortunately. Do you know, Mr. Speaker, that this rapist only was sentenced for 3 years. They caught him but he was sentenced for 3 years. I never would have known about the story except she called me because she was notified that he was getting out. They have a law in Georgia that you notify the victims when somebody on probation is coming. That just makes your stomach cringe, Mr. Speaker. This thug, this deadbeat who kicks down the door on a housewife at home and then only gets 3 years, that is why we need truth in sentencing. Mr. Speaker, it says, if you are sentenced for 10 years, 15 years, then you serve 10 years or 15 years. You serve your full sentence. I want to say this, that when folks are in prison, they ought to have work requirements and they ought to have education requirements. They ought to be out there busting bricks. Hard work, 40 hours a week. Education, 20 hours a week. That adds up to 60 hours. And do you know what, Mr. Speaker? That is what my middle-class friends are working anyhow. The people who are paying the taxes, they are not doing it on 40 hours a week anymore. They are running around doing all kinds of things. Sixty hours a week for a prisoner, that is nothing. Another case, heart breaker, a man calls me at home. His daughter, 12 years old, was spending the night at a friend's house and was raped by the friend's older brother who was 19 years old. He called me, Mr. Speaker, because it had been 3 or 4 weeks and the police had yet to pick up the rapist. When the daughter was raped, they took her to the hospital. They got the fluid samples and all the necessary identifications for this horrible experience. Yet it was 3 weeks. The reason why it was 3 weeks, I talked to the authorities about this, is that the police were so afraid of messing the case up because of all the loopholes that we now have in our court system that allows trial lawyers to bend and manipulate the system to get rapists, 19-year-old rapists who rape 12- year-olds, get them off because a police officer did not dot an I or cross a T, or the arrest papers. So in the meanwhile, while the police are out very carefully, meticulously building up a case on this, guess what? The 19-year-old is still driving by the house every day. The little 12-year-old who is now in trauma, who is now in therapy, she still sees this guy out walking the streets. We have an absurd court system right now, Mr. Speaker. We have got to get common sense back in it. We have got to say common sense is that we want to give everybody a fair trial, but it has got to be one that is governed by common sense, not by technicalities and loopholes. Justice should not be determined by money and whoever is the cleverest. It should be determined by what is right. So in this Congress, we have worked hard to crack down on criminal thugs and in lawsuits. Another problem, Mr. Speaker, that is adding to the stress of the middle class has to do with the fact that drugs are just going crazy on our streets. Earlier tonight the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Mica] had a chart that showed how drug usage has been going up in the last 3 or 4 years. One of the reasons is because we had cut funding on drug awareness programs. Mr. Speaker, I have been in a lot of schools in my district, the First District of Georgia. I have spoken to the DARE classes, drug education for eighth graders and seventh graders and sixth graders and fifth graders, telling them what illegal drugs are all about, what the consequences are about. Do you know, Mr. Speaker, that the average age right now nationwide for trying marijuana is 13 years old? That is the bad news. The good news is, if we can keep a child drug-free until he or she is 19 years old, then, Mr. Speaker, they have a 95-percent chance of being drug- free the rest of their life. So what we have got to do as families, as educators and as government officials and as a society is keep our kids drug-free until they are 19. If we can do that, they are 95-percent home free, and that is one of the things we have got to do. I believe drug education is extremely important for the youth of today. Now, in terms of the pushers, we have got to be very tough on sentencing for pushers. Let us get them off the street. Let us protect our families again. Health care is one more security issue that we have got to deal with as a society. We right now are trying to pass a bill that gets portability on health care. Very important for people who have job lock because of some situation that they can switch from job to job. My wife, Libby, her college roommate, a young lady named Kathy Haggard, was working for a bank when she discovered that she had cancer. And God rest her, she lost the battle. But during the period that she was fighting it, she went into remission for a short period of time. She was engaged. She, I think, was living in Atlanta and her fiance was living in Birmingham. They, Mr. Speaker, could not get married because Kathy could not quit working for her bank in Atlanta because, if she did, she could not get insurance through her fiance's insurer in Birmingham. So this young lady sadly lost the battle to cancer. She went to her grave without ever being able to marry, which is, as you know, probably one of the most wonderful things that anybody can experience. And if we had portability on health care, people like that would be helped by it, Mr. Speaker. That is something very important. Medical savings accounts. Something that I am very big on, and I know you have worked hard on it.

Members should be aware that this legislation sets no new standards on Indian gambling. It addresses one specific problem with one specific parcel of land in San Diego County, California. I would hope that the matter before the House would be free from controversy. This legislation is supported by the entire San Diego delegation, with Mr. Hunter, Mr. Filner and myself as sponsors. This legislation prevents the Cuyapaipe Indian tribe from using land and buildings not connected to the tribe's traditional homeland and purchased with HUD Community Development Block Grants for the establishment of a massive Indian gaming casino. The Cuyapaipe Community of Diegueno Mission Indians recently announced a proposal to relocate an outpatient health care clinic operated by the Southern Indian Health Council in Alpine, California. The stated purpose of the relocation is to permit the Cuyapaipe to construct a gaming casino on the clinic property, which the Cuyapaipe claim as their reservation. The Southern Indian Health Council was organized in 1982 by seven Indian tribes in southern San Diego County to provide medical care to their members. The Council's clinic provides vital health care services to Indian and non-Indian patients in a rural area of San Diego County, serving over 10,000 patients per year, many of whom are from low income families. The Bureau of Indian Affairs has recently rejected the Cuyapaipe tribe's application to build the casino, finding the paperwork incomplete. This provides a temporary stay of construction, leaving the door open to the future conversion of the Cuyapaipe's health care center into a casino. The legislation before us today prevents the tribe from using the clinic property to build a casino. Nothing in this legislation will prevent the Cuyapaipe from establishing gaming facilities on their traditional homeland. This bill does not affect the ability of the Cuyapaipe to build a casino on their own reservation. In fact, as amended, the bill goes to great pains to avoid stepping on the sensitive question of Indian gaming. It does not amend the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, and the amended version before us does not even deal with the question of the rights of tribes to conduct gaming operations, or the relationship between tribal and state governments. Instead, the bill seeks to resolve a dispute among several tribes, by requiring that they achieve consensus before changing the use of land taken into trust for all of them. As one additional protection, the bill sunsets in January of 2003, so the prohibition is actually a two- year moratorium","word.count":433,"sep11":-0.845505617977528,"years":2001.01404494382,"days":2141,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.219083947677938,"Topic 2":0.202333010495376,"Topic 3":0.00315387785793344,"Topic 4":0.0167126325518265,"Topic 5":0.00237017759690577,"Topic 6":0.00808695490728241,"Topic 7":0.0155803557662198,"Topic 8":0.00452581368211711,"Topic 9":0.526189587464673,"Topic 10":0.00196364199972811},{"id":"10820040004809","body":"James McGovern: Mr. Speaker, over the past few months I have spoken on this floor on a weekly basis about the scourge of hunger around the world, especially among children. I have talked about the importance of adequately funding the McGovern-Dole Food For Education and Child Nutrition Program, which would provide children around the world with a nutritious school meal. If we are going to make this world a safer and better place, I strongly believe that we must eradicate hunger. This is something we can do. There are some problems that we cannot solve, but hunger is not one of them. It is important, however, in any discussion about hunger that we not ignore the problem of hunger that persists right here at home. In the face of world starvation, Americans tend to forget that millions of people in this country continue to go without food every day. Thankfully, we do not have the rampant starvation that affects places like the Horn of Africa, but that does not mean people are not going without food every day right here in the United States. When we talk about hunger in America, we are really talking about food insecurity. According to the Food Research and Action Center, food insecurity refers to the lack of access to enough food to fully meet basic needs at all times due to lack of financial resources. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, about 35 million people experienced food insecurity in 2002. This is an increase of 3.9 million people in just 3 years. Of the 12.1 million households that were food insecure in 2002, 3.8 million suffered from such severe food insecurity that they are classified as hungry. The root cause of most food insecurity and hunger in America is poverty. It is unconscionable that in 2004 there are people in this country who do not have enough money to buy food. Approximately 35 million Americans live in poverty, about the same number of people who were food insecure and hungry. The correlation is obvious. The poorest people in this country are going hungry. The sad reality is that every day there are parents who sacrifice their own food so that their kids can eat. I recently read a speech by my friend, the late Senator Paul Wellstone, delivered at Iowa State University in 1998. In that speech, Senator Wellstone recalled how he traveled to the Mississippi Delta after reading the book ``Let Them Eat Promises'' by Nick Kotz, following in the footsteps of Robert Kennedy. Senator Wellstone was so moved by the story about how Robert Kennedy, when touring the country to see firsthand the poverty and hunger that ravaged parts of this Nation, tried to connect with a young boy in the Mississippi Delta. When the boy would not even respond because of his severe malnourishment, Bobby Kennedy just broke down and cried. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, I am afraid that if we left this Capitol building right now and traveled to another part of Washington or another city and town in America, we would find a similar situation. On that July day at Iowa State University, Senator Wellstone asked his audience, ``Can't we do better?'' Well, Mr. Speaker, the answer is, yes, we can. During the last several decades, Congress has passed landmark legislation providing nutritious meals for low-income children and families. While the programs created over the last century do not adequately address the problem of poverty in America, they help in part to alleviate the food insecurity caused by poverty. These programs are vitally important and have improved the quality of millions of lives since their adoption. The school lunch program, the school breakfast program, WIC and food stamps are just a few of the landmark programs that make up the core of our antihunger safety net here in the United States. Many of these programs are up for reauthorization this year, and our colleagues on the Committee on Education and the Workforce, led by the gentleman from Ohio and the gentleman from California , have produced a bipartisan bill that reauthorizes and expands many of these programs. While I am disappointed that this bill, as currently drafted, does not go farther than it does, it is a good bill considering the circumstances under which it was drafted, and I am looking forward to its consideration in the near future. Mr. Speaker, while these programs are important and need to be reauthorized and expanded, issues I will talk about at a later date, we cannot continue to ignore the fact that poverty is the root cause of food insecurity and hunger here in the United States. We have a moral responsibility to end food insecurity and hunger. We have a moral responsibility to end and combat poverty. We can achieve these goals if we have the moral and political courage to do so. The President recently challenged us to do what is necessary to put a man on Mars. That is a fine goal; but I would submit that a better, more urgent goal is combating hunger and ending poverty. We should begin a new war on poverty. Let us utilize all that the government and the private sector can do to undertake this challenge. Only then will we end the scourge of food insecurity and hunger.","word.count":886,"sep11":2.5814606741573,"years":2004.44101123596,"days":3361,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.162647478735875,"Topic 2":0.435043875474823,"Topic 3":0.0532142947848504,"Topic 4":0.0119596840995731,"Topic 5":0.251402149895599,"Topic 6":0.0137122843346365,"Topic 7":0.00370146547506065,"Topic 8":0.0079997337223153,"Topic 9":0.056014651009903,"Topic 10":0.00430438246736425},{"id":"10620000080397","body":"Tom Daschle: Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Robb on his remarks. I thank him very much for sharing them with all of us. These past elections brought our caucus nine new members and we hope many new opportunities to address America's priorities. But they also handed us a great disappointment, the loss of our friend and colleague, Chuck Robb. I am appreciative of the opportunity that I had just now to listen to Senator Robb, maybe for the last time on this Senate floor. I had feared he might leave without giving us a chance to thank him for his remarkable service to the Senate. It would have been like him to do so; he is an enormously modest man. In an editorial the day before the election, the Washington Post wrote: Chuck Robb's reluctance to promote himself--his commitment to sound policies over sound bites--may have cost him reelection, but they have earned him the respect of his peers and this Nation. In 12 years in this Senate--and for 8 years before that as Lieutenant Governor and then Governor of Virginia--Chuck Robb rarely spoke about himself. He has always been more comfortable speaking on behalf of others--the people whose voices too often are not heard at all. Today, on what we hope could be the last day of this Senate, I want to say just a few things about him that he will not say about himself, just to remind us what a good man--what a good man--with whom it has been our good fortune to work. As we all recall, he was elected to the Senate in 1988, with the largest vote total for any office in Virginia's history. It was the first time in 22 years that Virginia had not sent a Republican to the Senate. He has spent his Senate career working for Virginia and for what he calls the ``long-range, big picture, important issues'': national security, a balanced budget, education, and civil rights--for all Americans. He is a member of the Finance Committee and the Joint Economic Committee. He is the only Member of the Senate ever to serve simultaneously on all three national security committees: Intelligence, Armed Services, and Foreign Relations. He is a former member of the Budget and Commerce Committees, as well as the Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs, where he cochaired a task force that declassified and released vast quantities of information on missing U.S. service members. Quietly, with little fanfare, he has provided a steady leadership that has helped keep our Nation safe and move us forward. He is a lifelong fiscal conservative. In 1993, he voted for the deficit reduction plan that launched the strongest economic recovery in our Nation's history. He remains an important part of the Senate's economic conscience, always reminding us that our job isn't finished, that we must pay down our national debt. He has been a tireless fighter for education, the chief sponsor of our proposal to help States and local school districts build and renovate 6,000 schools. He fought to reduce class sizes by hiring 100,000 teachers and to make America's schools safer and stronger. He helped create new partnerships to connect every school in America to the Internet. He is as hard a worker as you will find in this body. In 12 years as a Senator, incredibly, he has missed only 10 votes. As chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in 1991 and 1992, Chuck Robb shattered fundraising records and ended his term with the strongest majority for our party in 20 years. He cares deeply about the values on which our party is founded. But there are values he holds even more dearly than party loyalty. A reporter asked him recently who his political heroes are. He listed two. One was the late Bill Spong, another thoughtful, effective Virginian, who served one term in this Senate and was the first southern Senator from a State covered by the Voting Rights Act to vote for the act. He said his other political hero was a man we all knew, our friend, John Chafee, ``because he worried about women's health, poor children, and the environment, and reached across party lines to find solutions.'' Reaching across party lines, being willing to work and look in new places for new solutions--that is something Senator Robb has done his entire life. He grew up in a Republican family. He is a founder and past chairman of the centrist Democratic Leadership Committee, and one of the original architects for what we now know and call ``the third way'' in politics. His ground-breaking ideas on the changing economy, new models of governing, and other ideas helped transform political thinking--not only in this country but in England and in nations all over the world. Quietly, modestly, throughout his career, he has tried to reach honest, bipartisan compromise on an array of issues. Here in the Senate, he has worked closely with his colleague, Senator Warner, on issues of importance to Virginia and our national security. As a member of our caucus' Centrist Coalition, he has helped us all try to find a middle ground. I would be sorry to see Chuck Robb leave the Senate at any time. The fact that he is leaving now--when we so desperately need people who are able to see beyond the usual party divisions--makes his leaving doubly sad. Chuck Robb only lost one other political contest in his life, when he ran for senior class president at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. Speaking about that loss later to a reporter, he said it gave him something important. As he put it: ``I needed a little taking down. Anybody who goes too long without some setback in life tends to lose an important perspective.'' One of the things Chuck Robb came to understand about himself back then was how much he loved this Nation and how much he felt he owed it. It was that sense of patriotism that compelled him to enter the Marines after graduating from college. It was that sense of patriotism, too, that made him volunteer to go to Vietnam. He didn't have to go; he could have served stateside. In fact, the Pentagon brass would have preferred it. They worried about what might happen if a President's son-in-law were taken captive and used to extract concessions from the United States. But Chuck Robb insisted. In April of 1968, 2 months after the Tet offensive, he landed in Vietnam, commander of an infantry company. Two weeks later, he was in combat. In Vietnam, he earned the Bronze Star with the Combat V, the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry with the Silver Star, and the rank of major. Most people who knew him, including his extraordinary wife Lynda, expected Major Robb to make a career of the military. And he did remain in the Marine Reserves for a long period of time, all the way until 1991, serving a total of 34 years in uniform. But he also found another way to serve his Nation. In 1977, the people of Virginia chose Chuck Robb as their Lieutenant Governor--the only Democrat elected that year to statewide office. Four years later, they made him Virginia's 64th Governor--the first Virginian Democrat elected Governor in 16 years. As Governor, he championed many of the same causes he would later fight for in this Chamber. He invested $1 billion in Virginia's schools--without raising taxes. He fought for civil rights. As President, his father-in-law, Lyndon Johnson, appointed the first African American to the U.S. Supreme Court--Thurgood Marshall. As Governor, Chuck Robb appointed the first African American to the Virginia Supreme Court, as well. He signed the legislation adding Martin Luther King's name to a State holiday that had formerly honored only Confederate Civil War heroes. His fellow Governors recognized his exceptional talents. He served as chairman of the Southern Governors' Association and the Democratic Governors' Association. He chaired the Education Commission of the States and the Council of State Governments. Even during the toughest political fights of his life, Chuck Robb did not like to tell people these things about himself. When others praised him for his accomplishments, he was always quick to say that it was ``we'' who deserved the praise, not ``he.'' His genuine modesty is one of the things that makes Chuck Robb a Senator's Senator. Another is his courage to fight for principle, even when he knows it will cost him politically. Chuck Robb has done that over and over and over again in this Chamber. One instance I will always remember came last March when he stood on this floor and explained--in a deeply personal, eloquent way--why he opposed amending our Constitution to make flag burning a crime. As someone who saw too many good men die for what our flag represents, he said he felt a sense of revulsion when he saw the flag treated disrespectfully. But--in Senator Robb's words--``they died for liberty and tolerance, for Justice and equality. They died for that which can never burn. They died for ideals that can only be desecrated by our failure to defend them.'' Someone once asked Senator Robb why he took such politically risky stands--especially in an election year. He said that--because he had been in combat--``I thought that I could speak out on some issues with less concern about the downside than some other Senators might have to think about.'' I don't know if he was right in that calculation. I do know this: On this day in 1791, the Bill of Rights was ratified when Virginia approved it. One reason it has never once been weakened--in all these years--is the brave and principled stand of Virginia's Senator, Chuck Robb. There are many things about the next Senate which I look forward to. I deeply regret, however, that Chuck Robb will not be with us. His departure is a loss not only for our caucus but for this entire Senate and for our Nation. Our Senate family will also deeply miss Lynda Johnson Robb, who is here today. She has given so much to our Nation throughout her life. And she continues to serve America as the National Chair of Reading is FUNdamental, and as Vice Chairman of America's Promise, the national service partnership.

I think that they have done the country a great service. If this House had been doing its job properly, this issue would have been out here on the floor of the House of Representatives quite some time ago. The fundamental principle that we are dealing with here is simply this: we are a Nation of law. All of our law is based upon the Constitution. There is nothing in the Constitution that gives the President of the United States the authority to violate the law. The President of the United States has violated the law. This is not the first administration that has sought to govern the country on the basis of the creation of a climate of fear. As one of our colleagues pointed out earlier in this debate, that can be traced all the way back to the Adams administration, the first Adams administration. But that attempt eventually was overthrown, and it didn't take a long time. The last time we had a President of the United States who wanted to engage in illegal surveillance on the American people, the last time we had a President like this one who was engaging in that kind of activity, was the Nixon administration. President Nixon engaged in illegal surveillance on the American people. As a result of that and other things, he was forced out of office. Subsequently the Congress developed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, FISA, in 1978. There are some of us who believe that FISA itself is a compromise of the fourth amendment of the Constitution. The fourth amendment of the Constitution guarantees independence and privacy to every single American citizen, and there are some of us who believe that the FISA Act compromises that. Nevertheless, it is the law. So what do we have now? We have a President who has gone beyond the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, who has engaged in illegal surveillance against the American citizens.","word.count":354,"sep11":4.89606741573034,"years":2006.75561797753,"days":4185,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0864626916702702,"Topic 2":0.291232270312195,"Topic 3":0.0203445539444145,"Topic 4":0.0422913178142073,"Topic 5":0.00999012506978338,"Topic 6":0.0237990088384635,"Topic 7":0.010832241429262,"Topic 8":0.0198918718833831,"Topic 9":0.0200785085470263,"Topic 10":0.475077410490995},{"id":"10419950006267","body":"Martin Olav Sabo: Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague the gentleman from California. Old friendships are worth a lot around here. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of the provision to withhold funding for expanding diplomatic relations until the President certifies that the Vietnamese government ``fully cooperates'' in accounting for our MIAs. This measure is essential to achieve the fullest possible accounting of our missing heroes. In repeated testimony before my subcommittee the most senior Defense Department analysts who investigate this issue have stated under oath that the Vietnamese continue to hold back critical information on servicemen who were known to have been alive under Communist control in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. In January, the U.S. Government gave the Vietnamese a list of 69 MIAs that based on the Defense Department's recent ``comprehensive review'' of all MIA cases. The review shows that there are over 400 MIAs who were last known alive or dead under Vietnamese control whom the Vietnamese can provide either bodily remains or their own documents, records and witnesses that can resolve their fates. Based on this official review, I provided the Vietnamese with an additional 29 priority MIAs that the Communists should be able to account for. About a dozen of these cases overlap with the Defense Department list. All together the Vietnamese has been given the names of 75 MIAs that the U.S. Government knows they can account for immediately. And on January 20, 1996 while visiting Hanoi Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord expressed to the Vietnamese ``disappointment in the level and quality of work that the Vietnam government Office for Missing Persons performs on cases.'' Although the Vietnamese dribble out isolated records and documents to manipulate the political debate in this Congress, the bottom line is that they are continuing to torture the families of our missing heroes. We have the power to stop this cruel charade. This provision is strongly supported by the vast majority of veterans organizations and families of the missing heroes. We have letters of support from: the National League of POW/MIA Families, the National Alliance of POW/MIA Families, the American Legion, the Disabled American Veterans, the Vietnam Veterans Coalition, the Veterans of the Vietnam War, Inc., The American Defense and the Vietnam Veterans of America. I strongly encourage all Members of Congress to support this much needed measure.

Mikulski: Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Conrad on this budget. He has done a brilliant job, and this bill will give us a safer country and a stronger economy. It will meet compelling human needs and take care of the long-range needs of America. This budget reflects America's priorities and my priorities: finding cures for devastating diseases, helping families with special needs, protecting our homeland and protecting our communities, supporting our troops with what they need overseas--and what they need when they come back home. Unlike President Bush's proposal, this budget makes a difference for families. It looks out for our returning military and rejects the President's Draconian cuts that would hurt the most vulnerable people. I am for this budget because it takes care of NIH. NIH is a jewel in the Nation's crown. It is saving lives and improving our Nation's health by bringing discoveries to patients from the lab to the bedside. NIH needs adequate resources to meet its mission. That is why I strongly supported doubling the NIH budget from $13.6 billion in 1998 to $27 billion in 2003, but this year the President shortchanged NIH. His budget flat funds NIH at $29.5 billion which doesn't even keep up with inflation. Shortchanging NIH means we slow down research and slow down our transition from research to treatment. We need this research to improve the treatments for autism, Alzheimer's, diabetes, cancer, and heart disease. I am on the side of science, which is why I joined my colleagues Senator Harkin and Senator Specter to cosponsor an amendment to increase the NIH budget by $2.1 billion. This additional funding will improve the health of the Nation by supporting research on causes, diagnosis, prevention, and cures. So this funding will save lives today and tomorrow. Our budget should save lives, and it should also improve lives-- especially for the most vulnerable. In December, Bush announced a new rule which said CMS won't pay for most Medicaid case management services. This cuts our most vulnerable citizens off from their social workers and nurses. This rule is just wrong. Without case management, Medicaid falls apart. If you don't provide the right services in homes and in schools, you can't coordinate health care plans to keep kids and the elderly healthy. In Maryland, this rule would mean 200,000 poor adults and children with disabilities or chronic health problems may not receive case management services. And in these tough fiscal times, my State will lose over $66 million and 1,400 jobs: mostly nursing and social work jobs Our budget rejects the President's reckless rule until we have a new President and a new attitude. I am going to make sure that we keep the commitments in this budget and keep our promises to those sick adults and children who need our help. Our budget also recognizes that families need a government that is on their side. However, the Bush budget shortchanges children with special needs and their families by not providing enough for IDEA. When Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA, passed in 1975 Congress promised to pay 40 percent of costs. Thirty three years later, we don't even come close. This year, IDEA should be funded at $21.5 billion, but it only got $11 billion. Bush talks about leaving no child behind, but his budget abandons a generation of children by making IDEA an unfunded mandate. Senator Sanders' amendment, which I cosponsor, would increase IDEA funding by $10 billion over the next 3 years and would dramatically improve services for 7 million children. These are children who can't make it on their own and who may need individual services like special attention from teacher's aides, speech therapy, and smaller classes. These aren't ``extras.'' They are essentials that may mean the difference between self-sufficiency and a life of dependence. America needs to get behind our kids--by getting behind those kids that need us most. The Bush budget also falls short, once again, when it comes to social services block grants. These are services that give people the tools they need to practice self-help such as child care assistance and treatment for substance abuse. The Bush budget cuts SSBG from $1.7 billion to $1.2 billion. That is half a billion dollars that States won't have to help their most vulnerable residents. And the President wants to eliminate the program entirely in 2010. I am outraged that the President would be so coldhearted but I am proud that the Senate budget rejects these cuts and restores funding to $1.7 billion. My home State of Maryland will receive $32 million this year. I know our communities need it--especially during these tough times. These services help families who are scrimping and saving to stay afloat. I know about social services block grants. Before I was ``Senator Barb,'' I was ``Social Worker Barb.'' The services provided are about more than checking boxes and pushing paper; they are about helping people with their problems and meeting them where they are. The Democratic budget also helps families by helping them keep what they earn for things that they need with smart tax breaks for the middle class. We do it responsibly and realistically by using the budget surplus to extend the tax breaks that matter to working families like the $1000 refundable credit per child, so families can make ends meet; like marriage tax penalty relief so that we don't put a tax on getting married; and like the 10 percent tax bracket so lower income working Americans keep more of their hard-earned pay check. Finally, we also make sure that AMT doesn't hit more middle-class families. These are the tax breaks that help Main Street, not Wall Street, and they are tax breaks we can afford. I am always going to fight for our first responders because we need to protect the Americans who protect us. But President Bush wants to eliminate Community Oriented Policing Program, COPS, funding. That is a $587 million cut from last year. The COPS Program pays for cops on the beat because the way that you reduce crime is to increase cops. That is why Democrats added $599 million to our budget for COPS. Firefighters also protect our communities. They need tools to protect themselves--and to protect us. Yet the Bush budget slashes funding for our first responders--eliminating one grant program for firefighters and cutting another grant program by $260 million. They put their lives on the line every day; they should never be shortchanged by their government. That is why our budget rejects the administration's reckless cuts and adds $2.2 billion more for law enforcement and first responders. The Democratic budget also supports our troops with what they need on the battlefield--and what they need when they come back home. We fully fund the President's request for the military, and we take care of them here at home. I am so proud that Senator Baucus's amendment includes the Defenders of Freedom Act. These are tax breaks to reward soldiers for their service--a tax credit for businesses who keep National Guard and Reserve on their payrolls when reservists and guards are called to help their country and a tax break on money earned because of service to the Nation. I want everyone to look at what the Bush budget does for our veterans. It is unacceptable that the President underfunded programs for vets. Promises made must be promises kept. Vets fight our enemies on foreign battlefields; they shouldn't have to fight their own Government for the services and benefits they deserve. Democrats understand, and we keep our word to America's vets by providing an additional $3.2 billion to come up to the funding suggested by Independent Budget. Finally, as the chairman of the subcommittee that funds science and our space program, I am pleased that the Democrats have an innovation budget. This is a strong budget for NASA: $18.7 billion for NASA. That is $1 billion more than the President's request. NASA is our premier innovation agency. It creates new technologies that create new jobs and excites our next generation of scientists and engineers. These extra funds will allow us to reimburse NASA for the costs of returning the space shuttle to flight safely after the Columbia disaster. I have fought for this extra funding for several years, and I hope we can make it a reality this year in the CJS bill. The budget also says that we must have a balanced space program of science, aeronautics, and space exploration and that we should work to close the 5-year gap in our human space flight program. I support these goals and thank Chairman Conrad for his leadership. Yet I am disappointed that the budget does not recommend full funding for the American Competitiveness Initiative at the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Standards and Technology. That is why I am supporting the Bingaman-Alexander amendment, to provide the fully authorized levels for these science agencies as recommended by the America COMPETES Act. This funding will provide critical investments in education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, STEM. This is the research that creates new technologies and new jobs. It is an important time for America. Our economy is in trouble, and we need to spend wisely. Democrats are making the hard choices to make America stronger, invest in our future, and balance the Nation's checkbook. The budget reflects the best of our country. It keeps commitments to vets and our first responders, invests in our kids and our future, and meets our economic challenges head on. Let's get the job done and pass this budget. Americans deserve it, and the Senate needs to deliver.","word.count":1612,"sep11":6.67134831460674,"years":2008.5308988764,"days":4817,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.101714128590372,"Topic 2":0.104851176279611,"Topic 3":0.00686583682815678,"Topic 4":0.00736648184882618,"Topic 5":0.0712425348998111,"Topic 6":0.00414301021189415,"Topic 7":0.558419240661967,"Topic 8":0.0713821648271687,"Topic 9":0.0666897097606138,"Topic 10":0.00732571609157942},{"id":"10720020012593","body":"Pete Stark: Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 4019, a bill to permanently repeal the marriage tax penalty. Last year, the President promised we could have it all. He argued that the projected $5.6 trillion surplus was enough for a large tax cut, an increase in education spending, and a decent Medicare prescription drug benefit. It's no surprise to those of us who voted against his tax plan that such grandiose promises have proven wrong. Now, one year later, instead of large projected surpluses, our budget is in deficit. Republicans now say that we don't have the funds to implement last year's No Child Left Behind education bill. Republicans refuse to propose a Medicare prescription drug benefit worthy of America's seniors. But, they are perfectly willing to continue spending trillions of dollars on new tax cuts for the wealthy. When is the Republican leadership going to stop playing games with our priorities? The bill before us today will not take effect until 2011. At that point, it will cost over $25 billion per year. Over the following decade, it will cost over a quarter of a trillion dollars. This is at the same time when the retirement of the baby boom generation will begin putting enormous strains on Social Security and Medicare. The Republicans have already shown they're content to lead us into fiscal crisis today. This bill continues to make clear that they want us in financial crisis in the next decade as well. This doesn't have to be the case. I support the responsible and fiscally sound approach to marriage penalty relief being offered by my fellow Democrats. Our bill makes the marriage tax penalty fix permanent. But, our bill simply adds a protection for Social Security. It says if we don't have the money in future budgets to enact responsible tax cuts, we have the option to put them on hold. The Republican's bill leaves the door open for future invasions of the Social Security Trust Fund to pay for forced tax cuts. We ought to be debating a prescription drug benefit and saving Social Security for future generations. Instead, we are forced week after week to vote on yet another Republican tax bill that favors their wealthy contributors. I urge my colleagues to vote no on the fiscally-flawed Republican Marriage Penalty Relief Act and support the fiscally-sound Democratic alternative.","word.count":394,"sep11":0.77247191011236,"years":2002.63202247191,"days":2717,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0138849236853443,"Topic 2":0.0858503635532497,"Topic 3":0.00423460569505683,"Topic 4":0.0512261808398322,"Topic 5":0.00449565605671293,"Topic 6":0.00288599799859611,"Topic 7":0.0468836196827337,"Topic 8":0.070807571718783,"Topic 9":0.694663444477974,"Topic 10":0.0250676362917172},{"id":"10820040055154","body":"Patrick Leahy: Mr. President, today the Senate considers the nomination of Paul Diamond to be a United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Mr. Diamond has a unanimous rating of ``well- qualified'' from the American Bar Association and significant experience serving as an assistant district attorney in Philadelphia for 6 years and serving as a litigator in private practice for over 20 years. He is supported by the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, for whom I have great respect. With the three confirmation votes today, the Senate will now have confirmed 17 judicial nominees this year alone. Seventeen is the total number of judges who were confirmed under Republican leadership in all of 1996. However, in 1996, the first confirmation did not even occur until July. With these three confirmations today, the Senate will have confirmed a total of 86 judges this Congress and 186 of this President's judicial nominees overall. With 86 judicial confirmations in just a little more than 17 months, the Senate has confirmed more Federal judges than were confirmed during the 2 full years of 1995 and 1996, when Republicans first controlled the Senate and President Clinton was in the White House. It also exceeds the 2-year total at the end of the Clinton administration, when Republicans held the Senate. With 186 total confirmations for President Bush, the Senate has confirmed more lifetime appointees for this President than were allowed to be confirmed in President Clinton's entire second term, the most recent 4- year presidential term. We have already surpassed the number of judicial appointments won by President Reagan in his entire first term in office. A look at the Federal judiciary in Pennsylvania demonstrates yet again that President Bush's nominees have been treated far better than President Clinton's and shows dramatically how Democrats have worked in a bipartisan way to fill vacancies, despite the fact that Republicans blocked more than 60 of President Clinton's judicial nominees. With this confirmation, 19 of President Bush's nominees to the Federal courts in Pennsylvania will have been confirmed, more than for any other State. With this confirmation, President Bush's nominees will make up 19 of the 43 active Federal circuit and district court judges for Pennsylvania. That is more than 40 percent of the Pennsylvania Federal bench. On the Pennsylvania district courts alone, President Bush's influence is even stronger, as his nominees will now hold 16 of the 35 active seats. In other words, nearly half of the district court seats in Pennsylvania will be held by President Bush's appointees. Republican appointees will outnumber Democratic appointees by nearly two to one. This is in sharp contrast to the way vacancies in Pennsylvania were left unfilled during Republican control of the Senate when President Clinton was in the White House. Republicans denied votes to ten judicial nominees, nine district and one circuit court nominees of President Clinton in Pennsylvania alone. Despite the efforts and diligence of the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter, to secure the confirmation of all of the judicial nominees from every part of his home State there were 10 nominees by President Clinton to Pennsylvania vacancies who never got a vote. Despite records that showed these to be well-qualified nominees, many of their nominations sat pending before the Senate for more than a year without being considered. Such obstruction provided President Bush with a significant opportunity to shape the bench according to his partisan and ideological goals. New articles in Pennsylvania have highlighted the way that President Bush has been able to reshape the Federal bench in Pennsylvania. For example, The Philadelphia Inquirer, observed that the significant number of vacancies on the Pennsylvania courts ``present Republicans with an opportunity to shape the judicial makeup of the court for years to come.'' I would note that the Republican leadership has decided to depart from the order of the executive calendar to confirm Mr. Diamond today rather than Juan Ramon Sanchez, a well-qualified Hispanic nominee to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District in Pennsylvania. That is their choice. I do not want to see the Democrats blamed for any delay in confirmation of Mr. Sanchez. I support that nomination and believe it will be supported by all Democratic Senators. I congratulate Mr. Diamond and his family today on his confirmation. I yield back my time. I ask for the yeas and nays.","word.count":726,"sep11":2.83426966292135,"years":2004.69382022472,"days":3451,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.184170046801279,"Topic 2":0.178299814435695,"Topic 3":0.0278625239690424,"Topic 4":0.036371734955633,"Topic 5":0.00717466065169677,"Topic 6":0.00886372385795384,"Topic 7":0.00792074713186515,"Topic 8":0.064128486187264,"Topic 9":0.477783870888964,"Topic 10":0.00742439112060834},{"id":"10720020048913","body":"Paul Sarbanes: Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to establish an environmental education program for elementary and secondary school students and teachers within the Chesapeake Bay watershed. This measure would provide grant assistance to elementary and secondary schools, school districts and not-for-profit environmental education organizations in the six-state watershed to support teacher training, curriculum development, classroom education and meaningful Bay or stream outdoor experiences. It would also enable the U.S. Department of Education to become an active partner in the Chesapeake Bay Program. Joining me as co-sponsors of this legislation are my colleagues Senators Mikulski, Warner, and Allen. There is a growing consensus that a major commitment to education, to promoting an ethic of responsible stewardship and citizenship among the nearly 16 million people who live in the watershed, is necessary if all of the other efforts to ``Save the Bay'' are to succeed. The ultimate responsibility for the protection and restoration of Chesapeake Bay is dependent upon the individual and collective actions of this and future generations. As population growth and development continue to place enormous pressures on the Chesapeake Bay region's natural resource base, we must learn how to minimize the impacts that we are having on the Bay. Our future depends upon our ability to use the Bay's resources in a sustainable manner. This is as much a civic responsibility as voting. Developing an environmentally literate citizenry that has the skills and knowledge to make well-informed choices and to exercise the rights and responsibilities as members of a community is clearly one of the best ways to raise generations who can be contributors to a healthy and enduring watershed. In my judgment, this can best be accomplished by expanding assistance for environmental education and training programs in the K-12 levels. In addition to stewardship, there are other dimensions to expanding environmental education opportunities in the Chesapeake Bay region that are equally compelling. A number of recent studies have found that environmental education also enhances student achievement, critical thinking and basic life skills. A 1998 report by the State Education and Environment Roundtable, perhaps the most comprehensive study to date, documents how 40 schools in 12 States, including three schools in Maryland and four schools in Pennsylvania, achieved remarkable academic, attitudinal and behavioral results by using the environment as an integrating strategy for learning across all subject areas. According to the study, students performed better in science, social studies, math and reading. Classroom discipline problems declined and students demonstrated increased engagement and enthusiasm in learning in an environment-based context. Moreover, students' creative thinking, decision-making and interpersonal skills were enhanced by environment- based learning. The report is replete with success stories, but I will just cite two examples from schools in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. According to the report, students in the 4th grade at Hollywood Elementary School in Maryland scored 27 percent higher on the Maryland State Performance and Assessment Program test than at other schools in their county and 43 percent higher than the State as a whole after the school implemented the environmental based education program. The study also found behavior improvements and reduced discipline problems for 6th graders participating in the STREAMS program at Huntingdon Area Middle School in Pennsylvania compared to students not involved in the program. I ask unanimous consent that excerpts from this study regarding these two schools be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:","word.count":576,"sep11":0.806179775280899,"years":2002.66573033708,"days":2729,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0403326165050976,"Topic 2":0.290203560924325,"Topic 3":0.00970333508622294,"Topic 4":0.0103081644434424,"Topic 5":0.605025088755452,"Topic 6":0.00331710853861012,"Topic 7":0.00292984570696069,"Topic 8":0.0149612240520971,"Topic 9":0.00397158911924976,"Topic 10":0.0192474668685421},{"id":"10419950008691","body":"Richard K.

Last week the U.S. Court of Appeals unanimously upheld its decision that radiation standards for the proposed nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain were not based on sound science and would not protect the health and safety of the American people. In ruling for Nevada, the court found that the Bush administration deliberately set radiation standards for Yucca Mountain that were not in keeping with the findings of the National Academy of Sciences as required by law. The Academy reported to Congress in 1995 that waste stored at a repository would remain deadly for 300,000 years or more, and concluded that radiation standards for the Yucca Mountain project should reflect these scientific standards. Rather than incorporating the findings of the National Academy of Sciences when crafting safety guidelines, the Bush administration ignored the law, ignored the science, and knowingly ordered the EPA to draft a radiation standard not based on the science, but an arbitrary period of 10,000 years. The gap between the science and the EPA standard? A mere 290,000 years. The court's ruling voids the radiation standard established by the Bush administration and is the latest in a series of setbacks that have clouded the future of Yucca Mountain. These include the lack of funding in Congress, a refusal by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to certify an electronic database required for licensing the repository, and a lawsuit filed by the State of Nevada challenging a portion of the administration's transportation plans for Yucca Mountain because they do not meet necessary NEPA standards. On their own, any one of these issues is significant enough to stop the Yucca Mountain project in its tracks. But the nuclear industry has friends in the White House and is in control of Congress, and they are gearing up for a fight. The administration's only option for addressing the court's ruling is to have the EPA revise the radiation standards to reflect the danger identified by the National Academy of Sciences. Such a standard will require that the repository isolate waste for 300,000 years or more. Yucca Mountain cannot possibly meet this science-based standard. The nuclear industry also knows that this court ruling would doom plans to ship nuclear waste to Nevada. They are already planning a push in Congress to waive the requirement that radiation standards for this repository conform with the science. Changing the rules in the middle of the game seems to be standard operating procedure for this Congress. Putting politics over the safety of those people I represent and denying Nevada the protection of our courts and our court system of checks and balances is something this House of Representatives has done before. It must stop. Changing the law will allow the administration to continue to railroad Nevadans by allowing Congress, not the National Academy of Sciences, to determine radiation standards for Yucca Mountain. There is not one Member of this esteemed body who knows anything, not one thing, about radiation standards or how to store nuclear waste safely at Yucca Mountain, not for 3 minutes, much less 300,000 years. Will Congress choose a 10,000-year standard? 5,000? Maybe Congress in its infinite wisdom is going to opt for no radiation standard at all. When it comes to Yucca Mountain, there is no limit to the hoops this administration and Republican leaders in this House will jump through or the lies and misrepresentations they will tell to move this project forward. I say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, there will come a time in the near future when you will be asked to decide whether politics or science should prevail in establishing radiation standards for Yucca Mountain. I urge you to respect the role of the courts in its decision determining the EPA did not follow the law, and respect the right of those who live in Nevada to challenge the notion that Yucca Mountain is safe. Science, not politics, should guide this Nation's policy on nuclear waste disposal. That is what George Bush promised when he first campaigned for President in the year 2000, and that is what he said when he came to Nevada just 3 weeks ago. He said he would respect any court ruling against Yucca Mountain. The courts have spoken. Now it is time for the President to act on his promise as well. The second highest court in the Nation has spoken. Work on licensing Yucca Mountain cannot continue until a new radiation standard is crafted that incorporates the work of the National Academy of Sciences. The President ought to stop this folly and stop it now and demand that the EPA comply with the U.S. Court of Appeals decision. As Members of Congress, we have a responsibility to make decisions that are in the best interests of our Nation. Waiving a science-based radiation standard to expedite this project means waiving the health and safety protection that we have promised all of Americans. The last time I checked, the great State of Nevada is in the United States and deserves the same protection as any other State.","word.count":458,"sep11":1.91292134831461,"years":2003.77247191011,"days":3123,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0298475448252421,"Topic 2":0.367879593599364,"Topic 3":0.00355862541523508,"Topic 4":0.0298276768306697,"Topic 5":0.0133371203513757,"Topic 6":0.0237937684715712,"Topic 7":0.011977402219473,"Topic 8":0.173671075238121,"Topic 9":0.33462836307454,"Topic 10":0.0114788299744074},{"id":"10419960072318","body":"Speaker: To the Congress of the United States: Section 202 of the National Emergencies Act provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date.

For these reasons, I have determined that it is necessary to maintain in force the broad authorities necessary to apply economic pressure on the Government of Iraq.

Whether we agree or not with the underlying provision of the bill, the Murtha amendment, I do believe and I do not see any reason why we should exclude any branch of the Justice Department or any employee. What the Murtha-McDade language establishes is an ethical standard for Federal prosecutors. If we take a look at the independent prosecutor right now, we have given the individual unfettered subpoena power and about $40 million. What does the Murtha-McDade language say? It says prosecutors and employees of the Justice Department shall not seek indictment of any person without probable cause. It says that they shall not fail to promptly release information that would exonerate a person under indictment, intentionally mislead a court regarding the guilt of a person, intentionally or knowingly misstate or alter evidence, I know that has never happened in the current investigation, attempt to influence a witness' testimony, frustrate or impede the defendant's right to discover evidence, offer or provide sexual activities to any government witness, leak or improperly disseminate information during an investigation, or engage in conduct that discredits the Justice Department. If that does not sound like what has been happening with this special investigation, this special prosecutor, and what has happened on the McDade case and some of these other cases, that is why we need this provision. This is not a political debate. This is what happens in prosecutions. That is why the McDade and Murtha language has come before us. So what the Conyers amendment says is that the independent counsels exercise their authority on behalf of the Attorney General and the Department of Justice, and that we must ensure that all prosecutors are held to the same standard no matter who they are investigating, whether it is the President or the person on the street. We cannot create a special class of Federal prosecutors. That is what we do if we defeat this amendment. This perfecting amendment needs to be passed. We cannot create a special class of Federal prosecutors that is not subject to Justice Department ethical standards. I urge all Members to support the Conyers amendment and rein in the prosecutors across the United States and especially the independent, so-called special prosecutors.","word.count":210,"sep11":-4.08707865168539,"years":1997.77247191011,"days":987,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.426841921953212,"Topic 2":0.037737542556291,"Topic 3":0.0212156892866554,"Topic 4":0.0343604128197961,"Topic 5":0.0365997845835641,"Topic 6":0.0161440039268988,"Topic 7":0.0143826866637406,"Topic 8":0.310688723481666,"Topic 9":0.0185323183516021,"Topic 10":0.0834969163765743},{"id":"10519980060865","body":"Edward Kennedy: Mr. President, I yield myself 7 minutes Mr. President, let me be clear: I am all in favor of Senator D'Amato's bill. Its provisions are included in the Patients' Bill of Rights. I was an original cosponsor of Senator Daschle's legislation, which preceded the legislation authored by my colleague from New York, that guaranteed breast cancer patients a minimum length of stay in the hospital following a mastectomy. And I worked with the breast cancer community--patients and providers--to write and introduce a bill that would require plans that cover mastectomies to also cover reconstructive surgery, prostheses and treatment for lymphedema, a complication of the surgery. In fact, Senator D'Amato modified his original bill, which covered only reconstructive surgery, to conform it more closely to mine. We share a commitment to this legislation. But his proposal does not include other provisions that are in our bill and which are equally important to breast cancer patients, their families and their doctors. The following protections, all of which are in the Patients' Bill of Rights remain unaddressed in the legislation proposed by Senator D'Amato: It does not guarantee access to specialists--provisions that would allow an oncologist to act as a cancer patient's care coordinator, or would allow a patient to see an oncologist directly, without first making an unnecessary visit to a so-called ``gatekeeper.'' It does not ensure for a smooth transition between new and existing doctors for breast cancer patients and survivors whose employers change plans or whose plans change providers in the network. It does not include access to and coverage of participation in clinical trials, which can so often mean the difference between life and death for patients with nowhere else to turn. It does not establish the right to an independent and timely appeal-- a critical feature for those times when coverage decisions fall into a grey area. It does not create access to prescription drugs that are not on the formulary, if they are medically indicated in the case at hand. It does not guarantee that emergency care will be covered, provided a layperson believed they were in an emergency. With the limited exception for post-mastectomy length-of-stay determinations, it does not fully restore the doctor-patient relationship by returning treatment decisions to the attending physician. Finally, it does not allow patients to hold health plans accountable for their medical decision-making. Clearly, the problems are not with what is in the bill, but with what is not in the bill. We are effectively precluded from including these particular provisions in the D'Amato proposal. And that is why these matters are linked, Mr. President. The items contained in our Patient Protection Act are critically important to breast cancer patients and survivors. Our bill has the broad support from virtually all the various cancer groups and breast cancer groups. But, if we move forward on only those included in the D'Amato proposal, we effectively preclude movement on the rest of the provisions. One can say, ``Well, we are still making some progress.'' I understand, but there is no reason in the world--none, no reason--that we cannot include these particular provisions for women today--none, make no mistake about it. We have had eight hearings on the issues relating to the Patients' Bill of Rights. I introduced the original legislation on this issue more than a year ago--over a year ago. The President's advisory commission, which included among its members representation from the business community and insurance industry, reported unanimously last November about what ought to be included in a patients' bill of rights. We have incorporated their recommendations in our bill. They are needed today by women across this country. All we are asking is for the opportunity to have the Senate debate and go on record with regard to these kinds of protections. But we are foreclosed from acting today. We are denied doing it. We cannot even get a reasonable period of time. The Republican leadership is sitting somewhere in this building. They could have listened to the exchange that was done by the Democratic leader and the Senator from New York. They know what is going on on the floor of the U.S. Senate. They can just come out here and say, ``All right, you got it, you are going to have an opportunity to debate this issue; we won't have a time limitation, call the roll and let's have a debate on what is the No. 1 issue before American families.'' But, no, we are precluded from that. You don't have to be around here a great deal of time to understand what is going on. We are effectively excluded because of the power of the insurance industry. Do you hear that? We are excluded from having an opportunity to debate this because of the power of the insurance industry. That is what is going on here. That is the issue this morning on the floor of the U.S. Senate. The industry does not want to provide patients with the protections to which they are entitled and have paid for, and their allies in the Senate are holding this up, Mr. President, by using parliamentary techniques to deny us the chance to consider this legislation. We cannot get a report out of our Labor and Human Resources Committee. We cannot take it up on the floor of the U.S. Senate. It is time for action, and we are denied an opportunity, not just today, not just tomorrow, not just June, but anytime whatsoever--whatsoever. We are asking the Republican leadership to give us a time. Call the Democratic leader. Bring it up in 2 days. Bring it up in 2 weeks. Bring it up in a month. But give us a time to bring this up. That is what this issue is all about, and that is where we are going, Mr. President. We will bring this issue up time in and time out, again and again. We may be foreclosed now, but the American people are going to demand it. Those women who have or have had breast cancer are going to understand it and demand it as well. I yield the remaining time to the Senator from California. I thank the Senator from New York for granting the time.","word.count":1041,"sep11":-3.42134831460674,"years":1998.43820224719,"days":1224,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0422508886376046,"Topic 2":0.679961606971348,"Topic 3":0.00977729726666833,"Topic 4":0.0221086624057044,"Topic 5":0.167382581876888,"Topic 6":0.00474619037000512,"Topic 7":0.0123596419331031,"Topic 8":0.0153342432993189,"Topic 9":0.0314286869744784,"Topic 10":0.0146502002648813},{"id":"11020080042702","body":"Ted Stevens: Madam President, 911 calls are a lifeline for those in danger and essential for our public safety personnel to respond quickly to emergencies. Public safety communications are a priority for Senator Inouye and myself as we work together on the Commerce Committee. In 1967, the President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice recommended that a single number be established to report emergency situations. AT&T established 911 as the emergency code throughout the United States. I come to the Senate today to speak about one of my constituents, a 4-year-old named Tony Sharpe. He is a preschooler in North Pole, AK. When his mother collapsed and lost consciousness during a gallbladder attack, Tony knew to call 911 because his grandmother had sent him a children's book called, ``It's Time To Call 911: What To Do in an Emergency.'' Tony called 911 and his mother received emergency medical help. Tony proves that proper education about 911 can help save lives. As a matter of fact, Tony, again, in another emergency, his mother had called 911 when they lived at another location. Once again, he had the privilege of helping his mother. This week I had the honor of presenting the E-911 Institute's Citizen in Action Award to Tony. He sets a fine example for young people throughout the country and Alaskans are very proud of him. Heroic actions such as Tony's led Senator Clinton and me to introduce S. Res. 468. It designates April of 2008 as the National 911 Education Month to recognize the need for education about 911 and make people aware of how the system works with new technologies. Ensuring that 911 is compatible with new communications technologies is crucial to the safety and security of all Americans. The E-911 congressional caucus has worked to pass legislation to improve 911 service. Last week the Senate approved S. 428, the IP-Enabled Voice Communications and Public Safety Act. This act will require communications services to provide customers with 911 access and establish a framework for IP-enabled voice service providers to coordinate with public safety entities. It also ensures that the next generation of 911 systems reach rural America and are available to Americans with disabilities. The Commerce Committee has worked on this bill for several years. I look forward to working with the House to send this bill to the President as soon as possible. We want to continue to ensure that our 911 system keeps up with changing communications technology and that Americans of all ages know help is only a phone call away. If I may, I want to say I am pleased to be here when the statement was made about the amendment of Senator Cornyn. I have been practicing law for a few years; as a matter of fact, for well over 50. I do remember several instances where we had to have counsel and expert witnesses. The difference here is, what Senator Cornyn is saying is a contingent fee arrangement as an attorney general enforces Federal law, a decision of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. We want them to do that. But if they need expert witnesses or they need outside counsel, they should make an agreement with them. If they succeed and get the decision they seek, they will be entitled to recover those costs under the bill we have before us. Reasonable costs will be recovered. But a contingent fee to be charged by an outside counsel or by an expert witness means that if the attorney general is successful without regard to whether those people are used, they will get one- third, whatever it is, contingent recovery from the defendant. This bill does not contemplate that there is going to be an award of damages in the sense of a normal damage type case. This is an action authorizing the attorney general to enforce a decision and make that decision applicable immediately within his or her State. We are seeking an outreach for enforcement, not an outreach for getting damages, particularly for utilizing the services of buddy-buddy lawyers or buddy-buddy expert witnesses to get money from defendants as we seek to enforce the decisions of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. I support the Cornyn amendment because I do not like the concept of contingent fees involved in expert witnesses or outside counsel when it comes to this type of enforcement of a Federal decision. It is a decision of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. It should not be the basis for recovery based on contingent concepts in this matter. I do want to make certain that everybody understands the Cornyn amendment. If it is not properly drafted, I urge that it be changed so that there be no question about the right of an attorney general to recover the cost of the expert witness or recover the cost of the outside counsel if it is necessary for the attorney general to have one. But I do not want to see contingency concepts entered into this type of arrangement. I was in private practice involved in plaintiffs' litigation. I understand full well the concept of contingent fees. They have been very useful in the sense where an attorney takes on a case and represents a client and, in effect, will do so without any compensation at all if they lose. But when they win, they share in that success by having their fee based upon a contingency rather than upon an agreement based on an hourly basis or a retainment basis. But this is not that kind of situation. This is for an attorney general--an official of the State--giving them, at their request, the authority to enforce the Consumer Product Safety Commission's decisions in their State immediately rather than wait for someone to come from the Consumer Product Safety Commission to their State and take action against those who should abide by the decisions of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. I support this entirely. It broadens the concept of enforcement. That is what we are seeking, that for decisions of the CPSC, to have enforcement available in 50 States immediately, if the attorneys general wish to do so. That will mean taking these toys and other things off the shelves immediately. But it is not the kind of situation that requires or should need an expert witness. Beyond that, why would someone need an outside counsel on a contingent fee to enforce what has already been decided by the CPSC? All that is necessary is action within the State giving an order to give the attorney general the authority to go take stuff off the shelf or to tell the manufacturer to cease and desist. That is not a situation that involves a normal plaintiff litigation opportunity. So I do urge particularly the lawyers in this Senate to understand what we are doing. We are not creating a contingency-type litigation field. We are only creating a situation where enforcement of the CPSC's decisions are capably extended to 50 States immediately upon a decision, which I think is going to help children. It is going to help the parents. It is not a situation that requires the employment of outside counsel or expert witnesses. But if some situation arises where it is necessary because of a challenge to the defendant, then the attorney general can employ them, can recover the amount in terms of both the attorney's fees and the expert witnesses on an agreement basis, not on a contingency basis.","word.count":1248,"sep11":6.64887640449438,"years":2008.50842696629,"days":4809,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0052092943948199,"Topic 2":0.00801848009782166,"Topic 3":0.00325375706299621,"Topic 4":0.00293807739000221,"Topic 5":0.00182899847439145,"Topic 6":0.0341160498705361,"Topic 7":0.00457920764462856,"Topic 8":0.276434878373749,"Topic 9":0.660273611088144,"Topic 10":0.00334764560291115},{"id":"10920060027238","body":"John Sweeney: Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr. Chairman, we are going to hear in a little while that there is substantial support in the ag community and other places, and I will grant that there is substantial opposition to this bill, as well as substantial support, within 500 horse organizations. But what I find most sad and in a way ironic is that an organization like the American Veterinary Medical Association opposes this legislation when employees of a slaughter plant blatantly do not follow the AVMA procedure for slaughtering a horse. Again, an important notion to understand is that slaughter is not the same as humane euthanasia by a qualified veterinarian. Euthanasia, according to AVMA, is an act of inducing humane death that is respectful and is painless and as distress free as possible. Yet we saw in that picture, that was transport, that was not even slaughter. That was a horse in transport. Horses suffer horribly on the way to and during slaughter, where they often endure repeated blows to the head and upper body before being hoisted up for slaughter, sometimes still conscious. That is not euthanasia. Slaughter is markedly different than acceptable forms of euthanasia. The AVMA requires that a captive bolt method must be administered by trained, skilled and monitored personnel and that the horse must be adequately restrained. These requirements are typically not met in equine slaughter plants, thus raising significant welfare concerns. Let me say something about the plants, too. One of the issues raised is that you are going to shut these plants down and people are going to lose their jobs. We are talking about something in the range of 150 employees. To my friends on my side of the aisle who talk all the time about how we have got to be tough on immigration, I suggest to you that a substantial number of those workers are not in this country under legal means. They are low-level laborers. It is the only people they could find to do this. I would also inform my colleagues that all three of these facilities, all three of these facilities operate and slaughter for other means, other livestock, and that they could simply go to that business.

For the past decade, the Children's Health Insurance Program--CHIP--has given kids in working families the doctor's visits and medicines they need when they are sick, and the checkups they need to stay well. Skyrocketing health care costs combined with a decline in employer- sponsored health insurance means that thousands of kids and families would go without basic medical care if CHIP did not fill the need. There are now more than 46 million uninsured Americans--9 million are children. This is simply unacceptable--every child needs health insurance. Without health insurance, many families must forgo routine checkups, crossing their fingers that their children will stay healthy. If their son or daughter becomes ill, they wait to see if the symptoms go away. But delay can be tragic. If those symptoms linger or get worse, parents are forced to take their kids to the emergency room for help. When a common cold turns into pneumonia, what would have been a simple, cheap fix if caught early, mushrooms into a complicated, lengthy and expensive treatment. Wisconsin's CHIP program, called BadgerCare, serves 67,000 working families and makes all the difference in a child's future. BadgerCare kids are healthier and more likely to succeed in school--including increased school attendance and a greater ability to pay attention in class. However, there are over 100,000 kids in Wisconsin who are eligible for BadgerCare, but are left out--in danger of having a small health problem becoming a life threatening illness. In order to reach these kids, Wisconsin received a waiver from this administration to cover their parents. Secretary Leavitt recognized that when the family is insured, children have better access to health care and get the preventative health services they need saving expensive trips to the emergency room. BadgerCare provides seamless coverage for families and works to reduce the number of uninsured children. Strengthening BadgerCare will ensure that this successful program can continue to cover working families in Wisconsin. It is a good investment of our scarce Federal dollars. The bipartisan Senate Finance Committee agreement to renew CHIP is the right approach. It provides an investment of $35 billion over 5 years to strengthen CHIP and it is completely paid for. No one loses health coverage as a result of this reauthorization. It keeps coverage for the 6.6 million low-income children currently enrolled in CHIP and gives States the resources necessary to reach an additional 3.2 million uninsured children eligible but not enrolled in CHIP. The initial price tag may seem steep, but, in the long run, it will save money. By catching and treating childhood illnesses early, we will save money that would be spent on emergency care. I want to thank Senators Baucus and Grassley for their tireless work on this compromise. It is my hope that the Senate will act to put kids first and support this bill.","word.count":491,"sep11":6.04213483146067,"years":2007.90168539326,"days":4593,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0573697576439065,"Topic 2":0.109721761334586,"Topic 3":0.0293416507017163,"Topic 4":0.010680527739477,"Topic 5":0.711045738599275,"Topic 6":0.0106903870688107,"Topic 7":0.00722457566021578,"Topic 8":0.0383829074545972,"Topic 9":0.00869326357668704,"Topic 10":0.0168494302207285},{"id":"10519980045753","body":"John McCain: Mr. President, I am proud that today we begin what promises to be a thorough and responsible debate on the issue of campaign finance reform. I say responsible because I anticipate that in the course of this debate Senators will make unmistakenly clear whether they support or oppose meaningful reform. Senators will cast votes on at least one reform proposal, the revised McCain-Feingold legislation, and probably other proposals such as the one to be offered by Senator Snowe before we vote on whether or not to invoke cloture. Previous debates have ended, unsatisfactorily, in a series of cloture votes which, as we all know, tended to discourage good faith compromises among Senators who are genuinely committed to finding a fair and effective solution to the disreputable state of modern campaign financing. Moreover, cloture votes sometimes obscure from the public a Senator's true position on the issue in question. By the end of this debate, whichever argument prevails, Senators will be on the record in support or opposition to reform, and, thus, accountable to their constituents who may then register their approval or disapproval at the polls. Mr. President, I believe an open debate, which considers amendments representing various views on the subject of reform, will encourage Senators on both sides of the issue to pursue a majority consensus on what can be done to improve our obviously and appallingly dysfunctional campaign finance system. Should our debate result in honest progress toward an acceptable compromise we may not even need to hold cloture votes. Of course, this is an ideal result of the debate we commence today, and I recognize that we are a long way from achieving it. But I believe, with just a minimum of good faith on all sides, we can get there. But even if we fall short again, Mr. President, Senators will have shown ourselves willing to stand up for our beliefs and risk the people's judgment when next we stand for election. I am proud of my colleagues for having the courage of their convictions. Mr. President, I want to thank the Majority Leader, Senator Lott, for agreeing to return to this subject, and allow Senators to express their views by means usually employed in Senate debates--by means of amendment. I wish also to thank my friend, the Senator from Kentucky, who has long shown he has the courage of his convictions, for agreeing to resume debate in this manner. I want also to thank the Minority Leader for his essential assistance in helping use to arrive at this important moment. I want to thank Senators Snowe, Jeffords and Chafee along with Senator Levin for their efforts to help the Senate achieve a meaningful consensus on a contentious issue involved in this debate, and all Senators, on both sides of the aisle and the issue, who have worked hard to ensure that this issue is fairly addressed by this Senate. I wish to thank all the co-sponsors of McCain-Feingold, both Republicans and Democrats, with a special thanks to a hardy band of determined Republicans, Senators Thompson, Collins and Specter who have labored long and hard to change what we believe to be a mistaken majority view among our fellow Republicans. Lastly, I want to especially thank my tireless, resourceful and passionately committed friend, Senator Feingold. I have been in Congress for many years now, and I have never worked with a more dedicated or able member of this institution to pass legislation of such importance to our political system. He has inspired my own determination, and I am grateful to him. Mr. President, we will hear from many Senators, representing several points of view, during the course of this debate. I look forward to debating various provisions of our legislation, as well as amendments offered by my colleagues on a range of issues related to campaign finance reform. As I have said, many times in the past, this is a necessary and important debate. The issue of campaign finance reform merits our most serious attention. Indeed, I believe it deserves to be a central focus of this Congress' work. I believe this so strongly because I think it is beyond doubt that the way we finance our elections in this country has caused the people we represent to doubt our personal integrity and the integrity of the institution we are privileged to serve. And that, my friends, is a concern that should call us all to action. The substitute that Senator Feingold and I offer today represents a substantial change from S. 25, the original McCain-Feingold Campaign Finance Reform Bill, but at the same time, maintains the core of the original bill. I strongly support all the provisions of the original bill. And as I have stated in the past, as the debate proceeds, Senator Feingold and I intend to offer amendments that would restore the component parts of our original bill. We intend to proceed to those amendments in good time. Pursuant to the unanimous consent agreement that the Senate entered into last year, the Senate will now turn to the bill S. 25 as modified, as an amendment to an original underlying bill. Later I will discuss my thoughts on the underlying bill, but now I would like to outline for my colleagues the contents of our proposal. Before I elaborate on the provisions of the bill, I want to remind my colleagues of three points: One--For reform to become law, it must be bi-partisan. This is a bi- partisan bill. It is a bill that effects both parties in a fair and equal manner. Two--Reform must seek to lessen the role of money in politics. Spending on campaigns in current, inflation adjusted dollars continues to rise. In constant dollars, the amount spent on House and Senate races in 1976 was $318 million. By 1986, the total had risen to $645 million. And in 1996 to $765 million. Including the Presidential races, over a billion dollars was spent in the last race. And as the need for money escalates, the influence of those who have it rises exponentially. Three--Reform must seek to level the playing field between challengers and incumbents. Our bill achieves this goal by recognizing the fact that incumbents almost always raise more money than challengers and as a general rule, the candidate with the most money wins the race. If money is forced to play a lesser role, then challengers will have a better chance. Title One of the modified bill seeks to reduce the influence of special interest money in campaigns by banning the use of soft money in federal races. Soft money would be allowed to be contributed to state parties in accordance with state law. In the first half of 1997, a record $34 million dollars of soft money flowed into political coffers. That staggering amount represents a 250% increase in soft money contributions since 1993. And Mr. President, unless reform is passed, we are witnessing only the beginning of this problem. We do, however, seek to differentiate between state and federal activities. Soft money contributed to state parties could be used for any and all state candidate activities. Let me repeat that statement. Soft money given to the state parties could be used for any state electioneering activities. If a state allows soft money to be used in a gubernatorial race, a state senate race, or the local Sheriff's race, it would still be allowed under this bill. However, if a state party seeks to use soft money to indirectly influence a federal race, such activity would be banned 120 days prior to the general election. Voter registration and general campaign advertising would be allowed except during the 120 days prior to the election. Voter registration efforts are very important. I know my colleagues recognize that fact. We want individuals to register and then to go vote. This bill allows parties to engage in voter registration activities. Additionally, state parties would be allowed within limits to engage in generic party advertising. These activities help build the party and encourage people to vote. To make up for the loss of soft money, the modified bill doubles the limit that individuals can give to state parties in hard money. Consequently, the aggregate contribution limit for hard money that individuals could donate to political races would rise to $30,000. This ban of soft money is important for two fundamental reasons: first, it would reduce the amount of money in the election process; and second, it would result in candidates being forced to campaign for smaller dollar amounts from individuals back home. Title II of the modified bill seeks to limit the role of independent expenditures in political campaigns. The bill in no way bans, curbs, or seeks to control real, independent, non-coordinated expenditures in any manner. Any independent expenditure made to advocate any cause, with the exception of the express advocacy of a candidate's victory or defeat, is fully allowed. To do anything else would violate the first amendment. However, the bill does expand the definition of express advocacy. The courts have routinely ruled that the Congress may define express advocacy. In fact, current standards of express advocacy have been derived from the Buckley case itself. As we all know, the Supreme Court case of Buckley v. Valeo stated that campaign spending cannot be mandatorily capped. This bill is fully consistent with the Buckley decision. What the modified bill seeks to do is establish a so-called ``bright line'' test 60 days out from an election. Any independent expenditures that fall within that 60 day window could not use a candidate's name or his or her likeness. During this 60 day period, ads could run that advocate any number of issues. Pro-life ads, pro-choice ads, anti-labor ads, pro-wilderness ads, pro-Republican party or Democratic party ads-- all could be aired with impunity. However, ads mentioning candidates themselves could not be aired. This accomplishes much. First, if soft money is banned to the political parties, such money will inevitably flow to independent campaign organizatio","word.count":2654,"sep11":-3.64044943820225,"years":1998.2191011236,"days":1146,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0051088214861334,"Topic 2":0.362384287830061,"Topic 3":0.20793707836322,"Topic 4":0.00737978067881584,"Topic 5":0.265420772387265,"Topic 6":0.0316013627264051,"Topic 7":0.0280453064940918,"Topic 8":0.035034683264598,"Topic 9":0.00667812428414737,"Topic 10":0.0504097824852629},{"id":"10619990004439","body":"John Dingell: Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.

The election results impressively demonstrate the strength and vitality of Taiwan's democracy. I strongly support the right of the people of Taiwan to decide their own political future. The victory for president-elect Chen Shui-bian, the candidate of the Democratic Progressive Party, and vice-president-elect, Annette Lu, a pioneering feminist and former political prisoner, symbolize the beginning of a new era in Taiwanese politics after 51 years of rule by the Nationalist Party. The development of Taiwan from authoritarian rule to a vibrant democracy during only two decades has been truly inspiring. The pace of political reform accelerated in the middle and late 1980s. Martial law was ended in July 1987 and in 1992, for the first time in Taiwanese history, a new parliament was elected. In its second direct presidential election almost 83 percent of Taiwanese voters cast their ballots--an impressive turn-out that underlines the great support among the population for the democratic process. I commend the people of Taiwan for this peaceful transition and their commitment to democratic values and ideas. The consistent growth of the Taiwanese economy is closely related to the success of Taiwanese democracy. I firmly believe that a democratic Taiwan is the best guarantee for prosperity, peace and security in the region. Taiwan has been a valued and reliable partner to the United States during the previous decades and I am sure this constructive relationship will continue, after president-elect Chen Shui-bian takes office.","word.count":323,"sep11":-2.55337078651685,"years":1999.30617977528,"days":1533,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.427974511685968,"Topic 2":0.0108344559060536,"Topic 3":0.0294134873736592,"Topic 4":0.021740514627649,"Topic 5":0.0236820831774157,"Topic 6":0.0534597299320968,"Topic 7":0.0403889062871053,"Topic 8":0.229792137672877,"Topic 9":0.00569864385441376,"Topic 10":0.157015529482762},{"id":"10920060001166","body":"Tim Ryan: As you were talking about, the Democrats have a history of balancing budgets in this Chamber. In 1993, without one Republican vote, the Democrats balanced the budget and it was signed into law by President Clinton, led to great surpluses, the greatest expansion in the history of the country and created over 20 million jobs. Now, the Democrats have tried, while we have been down here, to try to get our friends on the Republican aisle to show some fiscal discipline, to show a little bit of fiscal restraint. And we have tried. There is a provision here called PAYGO, pay-as-you-go. If you spend money, you have got to pay for it. If you cut revenues, you have got to pay for it. If you increase spending in a certain program, you have got to pay for it. Pay-as-you-go. Now, over the last few years, Democrats have tried to reinstate PAYGO which led to all these surpluses in the nineties, and then our friends on the Republican side got rid of this a few years back. But over the last few years, we have tried to put these PAYGO rules in. Let me give you three third-party validators, not Tim Ryan, not Kendrick Meek, this is in the Congressional Record. March 30, 2004. Republicans voted by a vote of 209-209, ties lose, to reject a motion offered by Representative Mike Thompson, Democrat from California, to instruct the budget conferees to put the pay-as-you-go requirements in the 2006 budget resolution. That is 2004, vote number 97, if you would like to check it out, Mr. Speaker. Also, May 5, 2004, Republicans voted by a vote of 208-215 to reject a similar motion by Representative Dennis Moore, Democrat from Kansas. That is 2004, vote number 145. And then again, November 18, 2004, Republicans voted to block consideration of the Charlie Stenholm amendment to the debt limit increase bill which would have restored pay-as-you-go requirements. That is 2004, vote number 534, basically saying, we need to put a system in place to make sure that this Congress doesn't just spend money recklessly like they are doing now. $9 billion lost in Iraq. $16 billion to the energy companies, the oil industry in particular, the most profitable industry in the world right now. Billions upon billions upon billions of dollars to the pharmaceutical industry in corporate welfare. And we are not balancing the budget. We are taking the money again and we are borrowing it. We are borrowing money we don't have and we are giving it to people who have a lot of money. This is the interest payments that we are making in the red. This is the investments that we are making in education, homeland security and veterans. Mr. Meek, I know we are beginning to wrap up and work our way out here, but I just want to share this with the Speaker and the Members of Congress. What else could the government do if we weren't so far in debt and had to pay all this interest?","word.count":508,"sep11":4.54494382022472,"years":2006.40449438202,"days":4060,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.16732290140871,"Topic 2":0.396162325413114,"Topic 3":0.00919555937086525,"Topic 4":0.00857039540142215,"Topic 5":0.0538781895928732,"Topic 6":0.00544405900310808,"Topic 7":0.00706006228917978,"Topic 8":0.0369651754991269,"Topic 9":0.308533583859351,"Topic 10":0.00686774816225009},{"id":"10419950084489","body":"John McCain: Without objection, it is so ordered The resolution was agreed to.

I don't think there is a Senator here who does not want to substantially protect and restore the Everglades. How do we do it? What is the most fair, most equitable way to restore the Everglades? I think it is important to remember we cannot let perfection be the enemy of the good. There is no perfect solution. But there are good solutions. The committee has crafted a good solution. It is true, as the Senator from Virginia and the Senator from Ohio are pointing out, we are breaking precedent. It is true. The provisions of the bill do provide for Uncle Sam to pay 50 percent of the operation and maintenance cost of this very large and very important project. That is true. I share many of the concerns of the Senators, the potential slippery slope; what is this going to lead to? Why are we breaking precedent here? It is a 14-year precedent, I think. It has been some time. What is a Federal interest? Sometimes it is hard to define what a Federal interest is. But just as there are more Federal dollars going in for operation and maintenance, on the other side of the equation we are also breaking another precedent; that is, the State is putting up more of the construction costs. Ordinarily the State would have to put up about 35 percent of the construction costs. It is a big project, about $8 billion. Florida has decided to put up the full 50 percent. So they are paying more than they ordinarily would. The U.S. Government will be paying more than it ordinarily would in operation and maintenance costs. This arrangement may not be perfect. But we are dealing with an extraordinary, special situation, and that is the Everglades. All of us in America feel a part of the Everglades. Certainly, the Floridians feel more closely attached to the Everglades, but I think the rest of us in this country have a feeling about it. It is part of America, a special part of America we want to protect and restore as best we can. So I say we should stick with the approach the committee has come up with after a lot of hard work, and a lot of give and take. In addition, I might point out 50 percent of the benefits go to parks, Federal parks, Federal land. There are about 18,000 square miles involved in the Everglades restoration. About 9,000 square miles of that is Federal lands; 9,000 is non-Federal lands. So it seems to me a 50-50 operation and maintenance cost share--it is rough justice. It is about right: 9,000 Federal, 9,000 non-Federal, 50-50; at a time when the State of Florida also is putting up more than its usual share for construction. So this has been a good debate. In future years, when we are faced with similar questions, I know the Senator from Virginia and the Senator from Ohio are going to be front and center saying: Uh-oh, here we go again. Remember that time in September 2000? And they will be making good points. But I believe one has to make a decision. The decision is now before us to proceed with the bill and not adopt the amendment offered by my good friend, recognizing they made good points, but I do not agree those points are sufficiently valid to warrant passage of their amendment.","word.count":578,"sep11":-0.997191011235955,"years":2000.86235955056,"days":2087,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0135987745452127,"Topic 2":0.678772921340775,"Topic 3":0.00626431257126829,"Topic 4":0.0705608409003615,"Topic 5":0.0406489142706011,"Topic 6":0.0119479760966483,"Topic 7":0.0052845684016959,"Topic 8":0.0827466904220756,"Topic 9":0.0678402218866784,"Topic 10":0.0223347795646835},{"id":"10419960012527","body":"Non-Voting Delegate: Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Democratic efforts to raise the Federal minimum wage. I am proud to have joined in sponsoring legislation which was introduced in February of last year to raise the minimum wage by 90 cents. I am chagrined that over the last 14 months minimum wage opponents have prevented this legislation even getting a hearing. When Henry Ford founded the Ford Motor Co., it was his philosophy to pay his workers well enough that they could afford to buy the products they were making. It made sense then and it continues to make sense now. An underpaid labor force cannot provide the consumer demand which is necessary to the long-term strength of our economy. Increased poverty ultimately brings harm to all sectors of our economy, not just the poor. A 90-cent increase in the minimum wage will add $1,800 to the annual earnings of a minimum wage worker. To them and their families, $1,800 can and will make a significant difference in their ability to meaningfully participate in the American dream. For an average family, $1,800 is enough to buy 1 year of health-care costs. We in Congress have struggled with the difficulties and expense of providing adequate health care to those who cannot afford their own. We know the tax cost to individuals and businesses when government must step in to provide healthcare benefits to the needy. The minimum wage is part of the solution. For the average family, $1,800 is enough to buy 7 months of groceries. Businesses cannot prosper when their employees' productivity is impaired by malnutrition. Children will not learn in school if they are not receiving regular, healthy meals at home. The minimum wage is part of the solution. For the average family, $1,800 is enough to pay basic housing costs for almost 4 months. Is there anything which is more important to a family's well-being and dignity, and a workers' productivity, than adequate housing? The minimum wage is part of the solution. At a 2-year college, $1,800 is enough to pay for more than a full- year's tuition. The changes in the American economy over the last two decades have left no doubt that only through education and training can American workers hope to better the lot for themselves and their children. Only with a large pool of well-trained workers can American industry compete with foreign companies. The minimum wage is part of the solution. Contrary to the disingenuous claims of minimum wage opponents, the typical minimum wage worker is not a teenager flipping burgers after school to earn a little extra money to spend at the mall. The typical minimum wage worker is an adult woman, working full-time, and supporting at least one child in her household. She is working increasing hours in her struggle to support her family and to avoid having to rely on the government for her child's next meal. Recent studies suggest that 300,000 people would be lifted out of poverty if the minimum wage is raised to $5.15 per hour. This figure includes 100,000 children who are currently living in poverty. We have allowed the minimum wage to drop to its lowest value in 40 years. In 1979, the minimum wage was the equivalent of about $6 per hour in 1996 dollars. It is now only $4.25. We have allowed this decline to happen, not during a time when our economy is suffering, but during a time when corporate profits, executive salaries, and the stock market are at record highs. A 90-cent increase can make the difference between a family living in dignity and a family living in poverty. It can make the difference between a family being able to afford adequate health care and a family having to rely on woefully inadequate public health programs. It can make the difference between a family being able to improve its lot by participating in available educational opportunities and a family doomed to a downward economic spiral. Henry Ford's philosophy of paying his workers enough to allow them to buy his products is still a good philosophy. America must pay its workers enough for them to be able to buy a dignified place in our economy. I urge my colleagues to support raising the minimum wage to $5.15 an hour. Millions of hard working Americans who deserve a better life will appreciate our leadership.","word.count":731,"sep11":-5.5252808988764,"years":1996.33426966292,"days":475,"party":"Other","chamber":"","Topic 1":0.0737335104045879,"Topic 2":0.0837971426498358,"Topic 3":0.0130785259159192,"Topic 4":0.506922344524392,"Topic 5":0.216087156138979,"Topic 6":0.00606768757219111,"Topic 7":0.00495169554728091,"Topic 8":0.0197595773415988,"Topic 9":0.0700722722622516,"Topic 10":0.00553008764296425},{"id":"10419950047449","body":"Toby Roth: Without objection, it is so ordered","word.count":256,"sep11":-6.26685393258427,"years":1995.59269662921,"days":211,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0655865584725159,"Topic 2":0.126449622860327,"Topic 3":0.0106686450750168,"Topic 4":0.284629163797162,"Topic 5":0.00659678930014955,"Topic 6":0.00272817570534837,"Topic 7":0.00461968887958694,"Topic 8":0.0421131774477387,"Topic 9":0.0444739743345825,"Topic 10":0.412134204127572},{"id":"10419960027928","body":"Carolyn B.

Since its enactment in 1990, the Ryan White CARE program has provided comprehensive medical and social services to hundreds of thousands of individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus and AIDS. And I am proud to be a cosponsor of this vitally needed legislation to reauthorize funding to continue the fight against this deadly virus. Ever 12 minutes another person in the United States is newly infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. This equates to between 800,000 and 900,000 individuals now living with HIV/AIDS. About a third of these individuals have been diagnosed and are in care; another third have been diagnosed, but may not be receiving ongoing care for their HIV disease; and the last third have not been diagnosed and, therefore are not in care. H.R. 4807 will take the Ryan White CARE program further than it ever has before to reach out and assist these infected individuals. This bill will refine the focus of the Ryan White CARE program, by not only continuing to fund programs to assist those individuals with AIDS, but by also creating programs to assist HIV-positive individuals. AIDS is the end stage of HIV disease and can occur up to 10 or 15 years after infection. By providing HIV-positive individuals with pro-active and aggressive treatment before it progresses into AIDS, we could enhance their quality of life and prevent further transmission of this deadly virus. H.R. 4807 also takes further measures focused on prevention. States with effective partner notification and HIV surveillance programs will be eligible for additional federal funds. Partner notification programs have been proven particularly effective in finding individuals from traditionally under-served communities and getting them into care. Federal resources will also be provided to assist states with efforts to reduce perinatal HIV transmission and to identify newborns at risk for infection, and individuals infected with HIV would be provided counseling to better empower them to disclose their status to potential partners. Mr. Speaker, with almost 1,000,000 people living with HIV and AIDS in America today, I am sure that many of us know someone who is suffering or has suffered from this virus. Unfortunately, my sister-in-law's life was tragically cut short by AIDS just four years ago. She had been infected by her ex-husband, and my brother and Kristin had no idea of her infection until she was near death.

In their search for more affordable prescription drugs, many Americans have turned to pharmacies in other countries, either via the Internet or trips across the border. While I certainly understand their need for affordable drugs, I do have concerns about this particular solution. We must find a way to ensure that the drugs Americans are buying are safe. I believe the Cochran amendment will do just that. Senator Cochran's amendment allows importation to take effect only if the Health and Human Services Secretary can ensure that it will pose no additional risk to the public health and result in a significant reduction in the cost of prescription drugs. So with this amendment, we get safe drugs at a reduced price, and our ultimate objective is achieved. Looking closely at the issue of safety, I am also concerned about the importation of counterfeit drugs. Americans deserve to know the label on the bottle--we have seen colleagues put bottles up and show differences. Well, Americans deserve to know the label on the bottle matches the pills inside they are taking. The only way to ensure that is to provide strong protections. We have all heard horror stories about innocent Americans, starved for cheaper prescription drugs, going online or getting in their cars to go to foreign pharmacies to buy their medications. They are coming back home with what they think is their usual medication, but the reality might be quite different. A recent New York Times article talked about the increasing number of counterfeit drugs. While in the past we may have noticed a misspelled label or off-color pill, today's counterfeit drugs are largely undetectable. The pills look correct, the cardboard boxes are the same, even the blister packaging and foil backing are all normal. But this is not your grandmother's forged medication. These are modern, scary, life-threatening tactics that place American lives in great danger. While the supporters of the underlying amendment believe their proposal addresses some of these concerns, there are a number of safety concerns that I believe must be addressed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and that is why the Cochran amendment is so important. The underlying proposal would undo current safety protections that ensure Americans are getting products that are essentially the same substance and quantity as what their doctor has prescribed. While the proposal requires an importer to retain samples of products, it does not require that those be tested to ensure the drugs are the same as what the doctor ordered. The proposal does not require that imported drugs be approved in their country of origin. It relies only on a paper trail to enforce chain-of-custody requirements, leaving consumers susceptible to unscrupulous dealers who can simply forge documents or copy anticounterfeit technology. While supporters of the proposal claim that they give FDA the authority to conduct inspections of foreign manufacturing plants, the reality is that the United States would actually have to get permission for those inspections from foreign countries, and that is assuming we can even trace the purchase of those products to their country of origin in the first place. Importers are not required to disclose the origin of the products they sell, so consumers would have no way to opt out if they wanted to ensure they were getting Food and Drug Administration-approved products. Finally, the underlying amendment allows importation from far more than just Canada. Written into the proposal is permission to import from Canada and other countries, including certain countries in the EU, even if the drugs leave the chain of custody of the manufacturer or fall outside of the Food and Drug Administration's jurisdiction. Because of the EU structure, we would actually be opening ourselves to drugs from countries such as Latvia, Estonia, and other recent additions to the EU. Some of these countries from the former Soviet Union have counterfeit rates up to 20 percent. The Cochran amendment would ensure these safety concerns are resolved and that the Government provides for the protection of the public's health and safety. Now, in my mind, as we have this debate, the real problem is affordability of prescription drugs, and the real solution to that problem is expanding access to affordable drugs in the United States. In that effort, I take a back seat to no one. But at the same time, I strongly believe we must also protect the health and safety of those we represent. These two goals are not mutually exclusive. We can and must do both. I believe this amendment--the Cochran amendment--accomplishes what we all want, which is expanding access to safe, affordable drugs. I encourage my colleagues to support the Cochran amendment.","word.count":802,"sep11":5.78370786516854,"years":2007.64325842697,"days":4501,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0127224649748742,"Topic 2":0.010731940171588,"Topic 3":0.00169385111854472,"Topic 4":0.0839712746971286,"Topic 5":0.0004549728214361,"Topic 6":0.00153363295650789,"Topic 7":0.00464930900423265,"Topic 8":0.00561287724993447,"Topic 9":0.876699650344467,"Topic 10":0.00193002666128653},{"id":"11020080050111","body":"Tom Coburn: Mr. President, I thank Senator Dodd. I think when you fixed this in 1994 or 1997 is when you required the banks on the mortgage to have a notice and pay it and then add to it. But it obviously was not enough teeth to get us up to where we need to be. So I think we need something stronger than that. Overall--and this is no reflection on the good work that has been done on this bill but we have to ask ourselves--we are talking about $30 billion with this bill. That is going to actually go against the Treasury. We are going to have $17 billion that we are going to kiss off. We are going to say the people who are living in these flood-prone areas, because their insurance did not truly reflect--we did not have it spread broadly enough, $17 billion of it we cannot pay back, so we are going to forgive that. Well, what does forgiving that mean? What that means is we are going to take the money from the Treasury, we are not going to charge it to the National Flood Insurance Program, but someone is going to have to pay that off. And who is going to pay that off? It is going to be our kids. And there is almost $9 billion in interest that is going to be not paid off, so we are going to charge that to our kids. Then there is another $3 billion still, I understand, to come from the Katrina-Rita- related storms in terms of payments that are also going out. So what we are going to have is $30 billion, because the program was not actuarially sound in the past, that now we are saying to our kids and grandkids we are going to make actuarially sound, and they are going to pay. So what we are doing with this bill--and, again, it is not an indictment. You made a lot of headway, but there has to be another way to fix this rather than charge it to our kids. So when you take this $30 billion, on top of the 10 we have now and the $74 trillion that is coming, we have a significant debt in terms of being fair to the next generation. This bill underlies and forgives all the debt to the Treasury, and it translates into roughly $30.2 billion. That is how poorly the program worked in the past. Again, I think we have made major improvements to the bill. But I believe it is important enough for us to vote on whether we want to send another $30 billion toward our kids rather than make people who have homes in flood-prone areas who are getting the benefit from it pay for a portion of the cost. Mr. President, I make a point of order that the substitute amendment violates section 201 of S. Con.

All of us agree that the agricultural community deserves to hear a clear message from the Congress of the United States that relates to farm policy. I am terribly disappointed that this afternoon we could not gain cloture, that the other side chose to kill freedom to farm. We also put up an excellent alternative to that and that--we could not work with that issue. Obviously, farm policy in its formation has always been bipartisan. I was confident this afternoon, or at least I thought I could be, that we had worked for several days to build that bipartisan compromise and still maintain the kind of levels of expenditure that sent a clear message to American agriculture that there would be some safety nets but, at the same time, that they were going to move toward the market as they have told us--week after week, month after month, as we have held hearings in the Senate Agriculture Committee this year--that a reinstatement of current policy simply would not work anymore and it should not work. While I know none of us at this moment are working on a reinstatement of current policy, I am very concerned to see us edging back toward it at a time when agriculture has said to us that is not where we ought to head. So I hope we can arrive at something over the weekend and into next week. It is my understanding the House may not be able to get there, as we had hoped, so we could at least show the American farm community a timetable that we are all going to be sensitive to. But I am disappointed, and I think we all are, that this cannot be resolved in the fashion we had hoped. I am going to have to, as I think others on this side are, look a great deal more closely at the deals that are being put together. We, in my opinion--certainly from this Senator's point of view--have gone as far as I know is possible to go without saying to Idaho agriculture we have decided not to do what we told you we were going to do and what most of you had agreed to. I presented legislation yesterday that had the full endorsement of the American Farm Bureau and a variety of other organizations, wheat growers, corn growers and others. I had hoped we could arrive at that in a timely fashion. It appears we are not there. I hope we are closer than I am led to believe we might be. But, to the leader who, I know, has worked today, and the minority leader, I hope we can get this accomplished and the final plans worked out. Timing is of the essence, that we resolve it.

This resolution does not use specifics as to how we reach a balanced budget. It does not say that we must follow the outline laid down by the Republicans on our side of the aisle--which outline I happen to think is a fairly reasonable one. The Senator from Nebraska has characterized it as ``extremist,'' but I do not know what is extreme about balancing a budget over 7 years, allowing the Government to grow by 3 percent over that period of time, allowing Medicare to grow by 6.5 percent, or $349 billion, over that time, allowing Medicaid to grow by about 5.4 to 5 percent or $146 billion over that period of time, saying to senior citizens, ``We will spend $4,800 on you today but in the year 2002 we will spend $6,700 on your health care.'' Those are hardly extreme positions. They are fairly reasonable positions, and they allow us to reach a balanced budget by slowing the rate of growth of the Federal Government. If you allow the terminology of the Senator from Nebraska to apply-- ``extremism''; this is what is being used often on the other side as a reason for rejecting a balanced budget--even if you accepted what the Senator from Nebraska has said that he would, however, be willing to agree to a budget which reaches balance in 7 years and that that is a doable event--he does not like our budget but it is a doable event. What this continuing resolution says is, ``Let's reach a balanced budget in 7 years.'' It does not say how. It does not give specifics. It does not bind the President or the members of the other party to a specific glidepath to reaching that balanced budget. It simply says the President and the Congress shall enact legislation in the 104th Congress to achieve a unified balanced budget not later than the fiscal year 2002 as scored by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Therefore, all it is saying is that we have to reach a balanced budget by the year 2002. It is not saying how we reach a balanced budget. It is not demanding a certain set of specifics be used for reaching that balanced budget. It simply is saying, during the term of this Congress, during our watch, we must put in place a balanced budget that is scored by the Congressional Budget Office which, of course, is what the President initially said he would use as a scoring agency. Therefore, when the Senator from Nebraska, the ranking member of the Budget Committee, gets up and states he is for a balanced budget in 7 years, it seems to me he should be comfortable with this resolution which says exactly that: Let us reach a balanced budget in 7 years. It does not say let us reach the Republican game plan for a balanced budget, it says let us reach a balanced budget in 7 years. So, I do not see this resolution as being on the extreme. In fact, this resolution is right in the mainstream of the comments made by the distinguished Senator. The further comments were made that it is ludicrous, and there is an attitude of futility here, in pursuing a balanced budget under these types of terms. Why is it ludicrous? Why is it futile to bind the Congress and the President to reaching a balanced budget in 7 years? We are not saying, in this resolution, you have to cut this program, you have to cut that program, you have to slow the rate of growth in this program, you have to raise this tax or cut that tax. We are just saying let us do it. Let us agree we are going to do it, we are going to balance the budget in 7 years. What could be ludicrous or futile about that? That seems like a fairly constructive statement. It is a statement which I suspect most Americans would say is maybe too passive on the issue of reaching a balanced budget. I suspect most Americans would like us to say specifically how we are going to do it. We as Republicans have. We have laid down a plan for that. From the other side we have not seen such a plan, but we have heard statements, like the Senator from Nebraska's, saying they would agree to balance the budget in 7 years. So all we have done in this continuing resolution is say: All right, let us take one little baby step on the road to balancing the budget. Let us, as a Congress, agree, with the President's support, that we shall balance the budget in 7 years. Let us not get into specifics, but let us just take this little step into the water. Let us put our toes in the water, the water of a balanced budget, and say we are going to commit to it. That is neither ludicrous nor futile. That is what we are supposed to be doing as a Government. We do not say do it in 4 years or 5 years, which is what the President originally said he would do when he ran for this office, and what many of us would like to do. We say 7 years, which is a fairly reasonable timeframe. During this period of 3 weeks, while we will be functioning under the continuing resolution, we have not unfairly impacted the spending accounts of this country. We have simply set up a structure which says we will spend at the levels, the lower levels of either the House or the Senate numbers. Or, if there is no spending on a program, we will have it function at 60 percent of its level, which is a fairly reasonable thing to do when we are talking about a short timeframe. Why would you want to excessively fund programs over their funding levels which have been laid out in the appropriations bills as they have been coming through? It would be unreasonable to fund them at the higher level. It would be inconsistent with good government to fund them at a higher level when we as a Congress may choose the lower level when we finally pass the appropriating bills. So it is the safer and more thoughtful course to take the lower level. Thus, this is a resolution which really does not do a whole lot. As I say, it just puts our toe in the water of the balanced budget issue. In fact, I happen to think it is far too weak. I have serious reservations about it. I personally am on the borderline of whether I even want to vote for something that is this weak on the issue of balancing the budget. But the fact is, it is not extreme, it is not futile, and it is not ludicrous to suggest the Congress, the 104th Congress, should commit with the President on this resolution that we are going to balance the budget by the year 2002. That is not only not extreme, ludicrous, or futile, that is our job. That is what we should be doing. That is what the American people hired us for. And therefore I take a bit of exception to the statements of the Senator from Nebraska and ask him to review those statements in the context of the resolution. I think if he does, he will come to the conclusion he can support this resolution.

This very afternoon two more coal miners perished in my home State of West Virginia in Boone County in separate unrelated incidents. This comes on the heels of the 14 coal miners in West Virginia who tragically died in two mines just last month. The death toll must stop. This is scandalous. The leadership, if I may use that word, of the Federal regulatory authority charged with coal mine safety, the Mine Safety and Health Administration, has apparently completely abdicated its responsibility under this administration. For the national spotlight to be turned on coal mine safety just last month, for those responsible for coal mine safety to be grilled during a committee hearing held in the other body just last month, yet to remain so aloof and so deficient in meeting their mission and mandate just boggles the mind. It defies logic. It smacks of callous disregard. It is inhumane. It is inexcusable. Just this morning the West Virginia congressional delegation introduced remedial legislation to force the issue, to compel the Federal agency in charge to do its job, to enforce the coal mine and health safety standards of this Nation. This initiative is high priority for us. The shame is that it now comes on the tears of even more grieving families and this sudden and unexpected departure of two more coal miners. Why is it that every Federal coal mine health and safety law we have on the books is written with the blood of coal miners? The status quo is unacceptable. It is totally unacceptable. It must change. I now call on the Mine Safety and Health Administration to do its duty and respond immediately to the request the Governor of West Virginia just made in a press conference. Send additional assistance to my State to allow the Mine Safety and Health Administration to do its job. Conduct a massive and comprehensive safety inspection of our mines. We must put an end to this continuing nightmare.","word.count":337,"sep11":4.50561797752809,"years":2006.36516853933,"days":4046,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.00617645604440535,"Topic 2":0.0475157030008858,"Topic 3":0.0243221170689906,"Topic 4":0.00474220035295798,"Topic 5":0.00625784081120693,"Topic 6":0.00752527956120334,"Topic 7":0.00473986041757737,"Topic 8":0.756215535150472,"Topic 9":0.129888272868148,"Topic 10":0.0126167347241531},{"id":"10419950034247","body":"Porter J.

For 22 years, northern Uganda has been caught in a war between the Ugandan military and rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army, leading at its height to the displacement of 1.8 million people, nearly 90 percent of the region's population. Just a few years ago, an estimated 1,000 people were dying each week in squalid camps, and northern Uganda was called the world's worst neglected humanitarian crisis. The rebels for their part are reviled across the world for their horrific brutality. Over the course of the conflict, they have reportedly abducted more than 66,000 children, forcing them into sexual slavery or child soldiering. In March of 2007, the Senate passed a resolution I introduced recognizing this crisis and calling on the administration to support the ongoing peace negotiations. These negotiations--which began in 2006 in Juba, Southern Sudan, and were mediated by the Government of Southern Sudan--brought a cessation of hostilities and offered the best opportunity in a decade to bring an end to the war. At the urging of this Congress and thousands of concerned Americans, the State Department finally appointed a senior diplomat to coordinate U.S. support for this peace process. That diplomat, Tim Shortley, played a crucial role over the last year in moving the negotiations forward. In March 2008, the parties reached an agreement that was one of the most comprehensive of its kind, including provisions for truth-telling, disarmament and demobilization, reconciliation and accountability. Unfortunately, the leader of the Lord's Resistance Army--LRA--Joseph Kony, has refused to sign the agreement. Far more disturbing, his rebels now operating almost entirely outside Uganda and instead in the border region between Central African Republic, Congo, and Southern Sudan have resumed attacks and abducting children. They are easily exploiting the region's porous borders and ungoverned spaces a problem which, in my view, constitutes a threat to international peace and security. Yet rather than intensify efforts to engage and pressure Kony to accept the agreement, the United States and others in the international community have downscaled our efforts. Instead of mustering the tremendous resources at our disposal to press the rebels to accept a political solution, we have turned our attention elsewhere again. As a result, there is now a haphazard military operation underway to contain the rebels by the Congolese military a force not known for its success in defeating armed groups or for respecting civilians caught in the crossfire. Yes, the U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Congo, known by its French acronym MONUC, is supporting the Congolese military, but MONUC is already overwhelmed by its inability to fully address its primary task: controlling the persistent violence in the eastern Congo. I visited that region last summer and it is a region desperately in need of greater security. Without expanded resources and capacity focused on this problem, a completely new offensive runs a high risk of exacerbating the region's volatility rather than addressing it. We have seen too many times in this part of the world how rash and uncoordinated ``military solutions'' have fueled the flames of conflict and generated new political grievances. This is not to say that security measures aren't needed to protect civilians in the region and thereby bring permanent peace to eastern Congo and northern Uganda. They are. Until we are able to build the capacity of national and regional institutions, the LRA and other armed groups will continue to exploit the region's borders and wreak havoc throughout these four countries. We need more inter-agency collaboration to consider how we can bolster sustainable long-term civilian protection mechanisms, while in the meantime devising creative short-term strategies to help fill the gaps. The calm brought by the Juba peace process presented an unprecedented opportunity in this conflict's history to rebuild northern Uganda's institutions, which is the surest safeguard against future violence and instability. I fear that this opportunity is being squandered. Since the cessation of hostilities was signed two years ago, nearly half of the people displaced have returned to their original homes and begun to restore their livelihoods. However, this process has increasingly been fraught with problems. The lack of access to basic services in the villages and transit sites, such as clean water, health care and education, has broken up families and hindered recovery. The lack of a capable and competent police force and judiciary has left women and girls vulnerable to sexual violence. Finally, the lack of programs to address underlying grievances and psychosocial trauma has allowed tensions to fester. Responsibility for managing northern Uganda's transition lies first and foremost with the Government of Uganda. I realize that the government has limited capacity, but it seems there has been a distinct lack of high-level leadership. In October 2007, the Ugandan government launched a three-year $600-million recovery plan for the war-torn region, but that plan has been mired in confusion. Its partial implementation only began 2 months ago. Moreover, there continues to be a lack of coordination between the government, donors, U.N. agencies and non-governmental organizations. I urge the Ugandan government to show leadership at the highest levels and demonstrate its willingness to fulfill the promises it made to the people of northern Uganda over the last year. If the Ugandan government leads and takes measures to prevent corruption, the international community should back it up with the necessary financial and technical support. To signal that commitment, I call on the administration to help convene a high-level conference of Uganda donors. Such a conference can coordinate an effective donor strategy to support recovery efforts and hold the Ugandan government accountable. This conference, though, must only be the beginning of reinvigorated institutional engagement by this administration and the next to bring this conflict to its conclusion, which is finally in sight after 22 years. Let us make it clear once and for all that the United States is resolved to see peace secured in northern Uganda. Too often this Administration has leapfrogged from one crisis to another in Africa, trying to put out fires but not addressing the underlying factors driving these conflicts. This is not a result of lack of interest or dedication from our diplomats, for I have seen first-hand their resourcefulness and hard work. But the reality is that the State Department's Africa Bureau is overwhelmed and under resourced. For places like northern Uganda or eastern Congo or the Niger Delta, we do not have the personnel or on-the-ground presence to respond comprehensively to insecurity. We in Congress must give greater attention in the coming months and years to ensuring our diplomats have the resources they need to operate in these neglected conflict areas. However, that process begins with us committing to these places, not just whenever they hit the headlines but because they are important to our collective security and to basic American principles.","word.count":1157,"sep11":7.19662921348315,"years":2009.05617977528,"days":5004,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.281892628791291,"Topic 2":0.3444571889912,"Topic 3":0.00716737261548749,"Topic 4":0.0469068084371599,"Topic 5":0.00757528632483173,"Topic 6":0.0153944635663863,"Topic 7":0.0151872643977853,"Topic 8":0.00950445853024954,"Topic 9":0.267140333374764,"Topic 10":0.00477419497084452},{"id":"10419960061658","body":"Carol Moseley-Braun: Mr. President, today the Senate is considering one of the most important measures that will come before it this Congress-- the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. As I have stated before, and can't emphasize enough, it is critically important that we address balancing the budget because that is the only way that we will be able to do anything about American priorities. As reluctant as I am to tinker with the Constitution, I believe that the arguments for a balanced budget amendment are compelling. We owe it to our children--and their children--to get our fiscal house in order. If we fail to do so, our legacy to future generations will be one of greater problems and diminished opportunities. Passing a balanced budget amendment will not prevent the Government from acting to help address problems, and working to help create expanded opportunity for Americans. And defeating a balanced budget amendment will not guarantee the Federal Government's ability to act on behalf of the interests of the American people. The truth is that, whether a balanced budget amendment becomes part of our Constitution or not, the only way to preserve Government's ability to act is to face our underlying budget problems--honestly and directly--and to solve them. If we do nothing, the Government's ability to act to address issues important to the American people will continue to be eroded. Only by balancing the budget will we be able to reclaim the Government's ability to make important investments in our communities, such as fixing crumbling schools, investing in mass transit, providing pension security, and ensuring that our airways are safe. Since 1980, we have added more than $4 trillion to the national debt. If we do not eliminate our run-away deficit spending, we will not be able to ensure that future generations have the same opportunities we enjoyed. We will not be able to ensure that our children and our children's children will be able to achieve the American dream. As I learned through my work on the Entitlement Commission, unless we get the deficit under control, by the year 2003, mandatory spending-- entitlement, plus interest on the national debt--will account for fully 72 percent of the total Federal budget. These few program areas already consume almost two-thirds of Federal resources. If we don't act now, if we wait until the country is on the brink of financial ruin, we will have totally failed to meet our obligation to the American people and to our country--and our children will pay the price for our failure. For example, current recipients of Social Security and those of us in the baby boom generation who will be collecting checks in the not so distant future, have an absolute expectation that Social Security will provide for our retirement. Social Security, thus far, has been a wonderful success, but that success is in danger. In a report released June 5, 1996, the Social Security and Medicare boards of trustees stated that, by the year 2012, the Social Security trust fund will begin spending more than it takes in. And by the year 2029, the Trust Fund will have exhausted all of its resources. And even the current Social Security surpluses will not stave off the coming fiscal crisis for many more years. To meet Social Security's obligations after 2012, the Federal Government will come up with more cash by raising taxes, making cuts in other parts of the budget, or issuing more debt. Right now, we are using Social Security surpluses to mask the deficits. After 2012, when there are no more surpluses, Federal deficits will really begin to explode, an explosion fueled by the looming retirement of the baby boom generation. The balanced budget constitutional amendment will not solve these problems, but it will make it much more likely that we face them while there is still time. Making the balanced budget amendment part of our Constitution is a demonstration that we are willing to face our long-term fiscal problems, and that we are prepared to act. The amendment will impose on Congress the fiscal discipline to do what should have been done years ago. If we don't act now to stop our run-away deficit spending, there will be nothing left for education, for infrastructure, or even for national defense. We have an obligation to the American people to discharge our debts and not leave them with daunting burdens that should have been addressed years ago. We need to make the balanced budget amendment part of the U.S. Constitution.","word.count":752,"sep11":-5.40168539325843,"years":1996.45786516854,"days":519,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.226032841680155,"Topic 2":0.0312802868339092,"Topic 3":0.0512395758169563,"Topic 4":0.0144364152418386,"Topic 5":0.0137635341902476,"Topic 6":0.279068206413775,"Topic 7":0.00515813356576421,"Topic 8":0.343425994532139,"Topic 9":0.0113438198376386,"Topic 10":0.0242511918875762},{"id":"10419950117921","body":"William Cohen: I am just going to ask a question of the Senator from Michigan. If we were satisfied that the missiles were in fact delivered, the question I [[Page S 11434]] would have for the Senator from Michigan, would he conclude that the law requires us to apply sanctions against China? I mean, there are many violations. I know the Senator has been attacked--or accused; not attacked--criticized for bringing this amendment up because it flies in the face of what we were seeking to do, namely to dissuade the Pakistanis from acquiring nuclear weapons. I think most of us voted for that, along with Senator Glenn. But the notion that somehow the Pakistanis have deceived us does not put them in a unique category. I think we can talk about the Indians, for example, who for years said, ``We are conducting peaceful nuclear explosions,'' only to find out years later that they were, in fact, developing a nuclear capability. We now have the Russians, with whom we have relations, who are also conducting, I believe, experiments in a field that should be of concern to this body, in the field of chemical weapons and biological weapons. The same thing with respect to China. I think the Senator from Colorado raises a valid point this evening. He is not seeking in any way to repeal or modify the Pressler amendment. What he is seeking to achieve is maintain the kind of relations, as I understand it, with Pakistan, that they have maintained with us. He did not mention, by way of specificity, at least, the name Yusef. Here we had a major international terrorist, as such, who was involved in the terrorist bombing in New York. It was Pakistan who helped us get him back. I think what he is trying to achieve, namely, to maintain a relationship with Pakistan that does not contradict or undermine the Pressler amendment, is something that is very worthy of our consideration this evening, tomorrow, however long it takes. But I think, if we are talking about whether we are going to trigger the Missile Technology Control Act, we have to look at those who are selling it as well.

As you know, programs contained in the Violence Against Women Act expired October 1. I have sponsored legislation to reauthorize and expand these important programs, and the reauthorization bill has received broad, bipartisan support in both the House and Senate. In fact, there are 72 Senators cosponsoring my bill. Also, the House of Representatives voted last week by an overwhelming 415-3 margin to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. This Congress, that has failed to act on several important legislative initiatives, has the opportunity to do something right this week. Majority Leader Lott can schedule votes today on reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, and it would pass overwhelmingly. The President has promised to sign the bill as soon as possible. The time to act is now. In South Dakota alone, approximately 15,000 victims of domestic violence were provided assistance last year. Shelters, victims' service providers, and counseling centers in South Dakota rely heavily on these funds to provide assistance to these women and children. Reauthorization of this legislation assures that South Dakota communities will continue to have access to critical funds for domestic violence services. A woman from South Dakota recently wrote me about this issue, and I shared her story on the Senate floor last week because I believe it made the most compelling case for reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. This South Dakotan was abused as a child, raped as a teenager, and emotionally abused as a wife. Her grandchildren were also abused. In her letter, she pleads: Please reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. Don't let another woman go through what I went through, and please don't let another child go through what my grandchildren have gone through. You can make a difference.'' I also heard from a Rural Outreach Advocate in South Dakota who said a grant from the Violence Against Women Act enables her and other advocates to help battered women in our state. She noted that many assaulted women and children in our state live in remote, rural areas that don't have available services. Without grants from the Violence Against Women Act, this Rural Outreach Advocate warned that we will be unable to help a majority of battered women and children on our state's farms and in our state's small towns. In addition to the need to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, I recently joined Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota in introducing legislation called the National Domestic Violence Hotline Enhancement Act. Since 1994, the National Domestic Violence Hotline has received 500,000 calls from women and children in danger from abuse. My legislation would create the National First Call for Safety web site that would allow National Domestic Violence Hotline operators to quickly and easily find the most appropriate shelter for callers. The highly secure and confidential web site would keep a continuously updated, nationwide list of available shelters and information about services and facilities offered by these shelters. My legislation is modeled after the successful Day One program in Minnesota. Day One has run a web site linking every shelter in Minnesota and reports that 99 percent of women and children who call are assured to receive shelters and services that meet their needs. While there are many worthwhile issues that must be addressed by this Congress in the next few weeks, I can think of no better accomplishment for Congress than to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act and pass my National Domestic Violence Hotline Enhancement Act. Simply put, these laws will help keep wives, daughters, sisters, and friends from becoming victims of domestic violence.","word.count":644,"sep11":-0.955056179775281,"years":2000.90449438202,"days":2102,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0545412328865317,"Topic 2":0.0441584972340409,"Topic 3":0.00631543669422925,"Topic 4":0.379525682822433,"Topic 5":0.00570661638280338,"Topic 6":0.00218921249346053,"Topic 7":0.0256521576677733,"Topic 8":0.0886935084788847,"Topic 9":0.0108973355300157,"Topic 10":0.382320319809827},{"id":"11020080004755","body":"Scott Garrett: I thank the gentleman for yielding the time. Mr. Speaker, today the United States Congress will stand up for the people of Israel by sending a message to the terrorists and also to those countries that aid them. Rocket attacks and intentional violence against innocent civilians will not be tolerated. Israeli communities like Sderot and Ashkelon have sustained terrible, egregious damage, and the citizens have suffered from serious injuries, even fatalities. I should point out that oftentimes Palestinians as well, those who do not support the violence, are also victims of the crossfire. It is time that this brutality come to an end for all people. Passing this resolution today truly is just a stepping stone to help end those egregious, aggressive acts of Palestinian terrorists and ensuring that innocent civilians in Israel can live together and live peacefully. It is violent Palestinian groups and terrorist organizations that must be held accountable for their horrific acts. Organizations such as Hamas, the Islamic Jihad and the Popular Resistance Committee, the PRC, need to understand that when they attack the people of Israel, the United States and other countries and the U.S. House of Representatives will not remain silent. Unjust actions like this must not go unpunished. Today, we have a gentleman from one of those communities, Sderot, with us here in the House, in the House galleries. If he was here on the floor with us, he could share with us the life-and-death circumstances that he and his family and his neighbors and his community experience on a day-to-day basis. As we are here on the floor of this House, in the safety of this city and of this community and of this country, we have to think about the men and women, think about the children who are back there right now, the children who, for all we may know, are in their safe rooms cowering, wondering when the next attack may be coming. Many of those members of the community have already made the decision that it is just unbearable to live under that threat, under the constant pressure of not knowing when the next attack, when the next missile strike will come. And upwards around 20 percent of the country or the community has left, fled the area to safer havens, wherever they may be. If this was an incident occurring in our country, along the borders of the United States, would we sit idly by while our neighboring country or the terrorists within that were lobbing rockets into it, into our territory? I think not. It is for that reason that it is so unfortunate that other portions of the world community, parts of the U.N., have condemned Israel for taking defensive measures such as they have here. I come to the floor today with my colleagues as well from both sides of the aisle and I appreciate the bipartisan support, to say, who will condemn the attackers? Well, Mr. Speaker, I will. We will. This House of Representatives will, and this country will. Rest assured that I will continue to ensure that the Islamic radicals are held responsible for launching these vicious attacks, and also that countries like Iran, Egypt and Syria, which support terrorists and allow this activity to continue, should be held accountable as well. I will join with my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to continue this fight until the global community joins in with the U.S. in condemning terrorism and its violent acts.","word.count":583,"sep11":6.64887640449438,"years":2008.50842696629,"days":4809,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.00680563273952037,"Topic 2":0.0742398415076798,"Topic 3":0.112426256063204,"Topic 4":0.00368696729840172,"Topic 5":0.148073406360597,"Topic 6":0.00378421639698668,"Topic 7":0.0017956525868732,"Topic 8":0.0852517184678853,"Topic 9":0.021127610948739,"Topic 10":0.542808697630113},{"id":"10920050038249","body":"Adam Putnam: Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Environment and Public Works be authorized to hold an oversight hearing on the status of the Yucca Mountain Project on Wednesday, March 1 at 2:30 p.m.","word.count":1257,"sep11":4.35112359550562,"years":2006.2106741573,"days":3991,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0981698411903662,"Topic 2":0.0303218415928765,"Topic 3":0.256151836733594,"Topic 4":0.103444870063971,"Topic 5":0.267416072359648,"Topic 6":0.0110985209778723,"Topic 7":0.00229813804007585,"Topic 8":0.168112198646995,"Topic 9":0.0127874860925877,"Topic 10":0.0501991943020138},{"id":"11020080001783","body":"Donald M.

Every time this project comes before us, its costs rise and its scientific rationale grows more dubious. Criticism of NIF has come from groups as diverse as the Friends of the Earth and the Armed Services Committee. This project has already sucked up billions of taxpayer dollars while endangering our environment and sabotaging efforts to reduce nuclear proliferation. The National Ignition Facility represents the flagship of the Stockpile Stewardship nuclear weapons program. That is no great honor. This project, together with National Missile Defense, symbolizes the American failure to lead the way on global nuclear arms control. If the National Ignition Facility continues to fail to achieve its stated goal of ignition, it will remain a financial quagmire that has depleted badly needed financial resources. If it succeeds, it threatens to send the arms race spiraling to an ever higher level. Now is the time to seriously evaluate this program. We should not put more money into construction for a project that is neither necessary nor productive. This project is now approximately one billion dollars over budget. It is 5 years behind schedule. Ultimately, there are economic, geopolitical, and environmental reasons to oppose continued construction of the National Ignition Facility. Economically, NIF is over budget and over due. Geoplitically, this effort to create thermonuclear explosions in a laboratory setting undermines U.S. efforts to reduce nuclear weapons across the globe. Environmentally, Californians are already justifiably concerned about the release of tritium into their environment. Increasing nuclear waste is not the solution. I repeat, it is time to seriously reevaluate this program.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6095, the Immigration Law Enforcement Act of 2006, which will allow Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers to more effectively enforce our immigration laws along the border and in the interior of the United States. Title I of the legislation is based on an amendment to H.R. 4437 offered by the gentleman from Georgia . The title reaffirms the inherent authority of State and local law enforcement to voluntarily, and I emphasize the word ``voluntarily,'' assist in the enforcement of U.S. immigration laws. Many local and State law enforcement officers are eager to assist in the enforcement of our immigration laws to protect their communities and serve as a valuable force multiplier to overburdened Department of Homeland Security officers. We should provide them with the clear authority they seek rather than placing obstacles in their way. Title II of the bill contains the Alien Smuggler Prosecution Act. Currently, the various United States Attorney offices do not use uniform guidelines to prosecute smuggling offenses. While border area U.S. Attorneys face a heavy workload, a lack of sufficient smuggling prosecutions in some areas has become a serious problem. This has encouraged additional smuggling and demoralized Border Patrol and DHS agents who have seen many of the smugglers they have apprehended released. This title contains a sense of Congress that the Attorney General should adopt uniform guidelines for the prosecution of smuggling offenses by each U.S. Attorney's office and authorizes an increase in the number of attorneys in U.S. Attorneys' offices to prosecute such cases. The bill requires an increase of not less than 20 new attorneys over the previous years' level in each of fiscal years 2008 to 2013, to affirm the urgency of prosecuting the alien smugglers who prey on the most vulnerable. Title III provides for ending the Catch and Release Act. DHS is subject to Federal court injunctions entered as much as 30 years ago that impact its ability to enforce immigration laws. For instance, one injunction dating from the El Salvadoran civil war of the 1980s effectively prevents DHS from placing Salvadorans in expedited removal proceedings. DHS is using expedited removal to expeditiously remove other non-Mexican illegal immigrants who are apprehended along the southern border in order to end the policy of catch and release, but not Salvadorans. Under the catch and release policy, non-Mexican illegal aliens picked up by the Border Patrol were simply released into our communities and told to show up months later for removal hearings. They almost never attended. Catch and release made a mockery of border enforcement and has terribly demoralized Border Patrol agents. Mr. Speaker, this provides law enforcement agencies at all levels of government with the clear authority to help ensure the integrity and enforceability of our Nation's immigration laws. I urge my colleagues to support the bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.","word.count":914,"sep11":4.15168539325843,"years":2006.01123595506,"days":3920,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0806584215776635,"Topic 2":0.0109890105521874,"Topic 3":0.0168386357587292,"Topic 4":0.0416511928731105,"Topic 5":0.101270702589707,"Topic 6":0.326258679465628,"Topic 7":0.00233875251991392,"Topic 8":0.383195762973463,"Topic 9":0.00498485261926336,"Topic 10":0.0318139890703338},{"id":"11020070066573","body":"Christopher S.

This is a great honor. I have worked in public service, in one way or another, for about 40 years now. During my career, I have become aware of the horrible effects of sexual assault and child abuse--on the victims, but also on our community as a whole. It is a silent epidemic that is shattering lives across America. We have made progress in helping abuse victims, and that is largely because of the hard work of your organization. Since 1994, more than 970,000 people have called your National Sexual Assault Hotline. More than 5,300 of them were Nevadans. Your work makes an incredible difference in people's lives. But too many victims are still suffering in the shadows. We need to do more to strengthen laws to fight sexual assault, to provide law enforcement with the tools and funding they need, and to support victims. I have always been a strong supporter of the Violence Against Women Act. As you probably know, VAWA was landmark legislation that expanded the Federal Government's commitment to eliminating violence against women. I was a cosponsor of the original act back in 1990, and I have voted for it every time it has come up for reauthorization. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I have worked to get funding for sexual assault prevention programs and victims aid programs in Nevada and around the country. I was also happy to work with RAINN last year to get funding to help victims. I hope some of this money will be used specifically to help the victims of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita. We set aside $500,000 in last year's Federal budget. I think it should have been more the Senate approved more, but the House did not--but I am happy we were able to get the funding.

By their presence, I glean from their words that although we have this month to commemorate black history, the contributions of black Americans are so very important as it relates to the history of this Nation. The Preamble to the Constitution of this great Nation aptly begins, ``We the people.'' As I take my place on the floor of the House of Representatives to pay tribute to African Americans, I am reminded of the fact that those who first took their place in this very spot did not include me nor my people and their vision of ``We the people.'' To ``secure the blessing of liberty to ourselves and our posterity'' is one of the basic reasons that the Constitution was ``ordained'' and ``established.'' These are basic tenets of freedom. This portion of the Preamble to the Constitution reminds us of the economic empowerment that surrounded the push towards the establishment of this great country. That is why it is so apropos that we celebrate African Americans in business, the path towards empowerment. There is no doubt that African Americans and Black History Month are one and the same. They recognize the importance of providing the pathway for evidencing what we have done for this country. African Americans have made unique contributions to the significant scientific and technological advancement of this country and to the growth and popularity of American culture around the world. Many of the modern conveniences that we enjoy today were invented by African Americans. Where would we be without the stop light invented by Garrett Morgan; the incandescent light bulb invented by Lewis Latimer; Dr. Charles Drew, a pioneer in blood research who established the first blood bank; and George Washington Carver, who so often we found as youngsters enjoyment in studying, maybe one of the few African Americans that our teachers allowed us to know? He revolutionized the agricultural economy of the South with his novel ideas on crop rotation. Today African American scientists and astronauts are expanding our knowledge of space. How many of us know the names of these African American astronauts who have led the way for our country to be the leader in space exploration and space-based science? Major Lawrence, the first African American astronaut, Ron McNair, Guion Bluford, first African American to actually fly in space and Ron McNair who lost his life in the tragic Challenger accident, General Fred Geory, Charles Bolan, Mai Jaimson, first African American woman in space, Robert Curbeam, Winston Scott, Evon Cagle, Joan Higginbotham, Stephanie Wilson, Bernard Harris and Mike Anderson, an African American astronaut who flew in January on the last mission of the space shuttle Endeavor to Mir. The economic benefits gained from the work of these African Americans has proved monumental. Our path towards economic empowerment has forged its way even through the hard times. And yes, even our African American farmers, our small businesses and large businesses to pay tribute to. For it was after slavery when we were told that we would receive 40 acres and a mule. I am sad to say that to this day, we have not received the full measure of the 40 acres and a mule. But our African American farmers in the deep South, the Midwest and other parts have held steady and strong, keeping up the good fight, providing that enhancement of economic opportunity that has kept this country going. I hope as we proceed to celebrate this day and as well as we celebrate African American history throughout the years to come, we will pay tribute to our African American farmers and the justice that they deserve. Now let me simply say this, Mr. Speaker. I too wanted to acknowledge the gentlewoman from California for her leadership in the Congressional Black Caucus, and certainly since we are talking about minority businesses and in this instance African American businesses, let me acknowledge Mr. Minority Business or African American Business in the United States Congress, Parren Mitchell, and thank him for his leadership on these issues of opening the doors of opportunity. Kweisi Mfume followed him with his interests in small business, and now the gentleman from Maryland . None of these individuals gave particular interest for their own self-aggrandizement, but they knew that it was important for us to be strong economically. So they championed, along with other members of this Caucus, affirmative action. I would simply say that now is the time, as we celebrate this month, that we recognize that the struggle is not over. Affirmative action is under siege and many of our African American businesses that are successful today are successful because of African American effort in promoting affirmative action that has helped so many in this Nation, the rule of two that has provided for opportunities for small businesses and, yes, the Community Reinvestment Act that forced many of our Nation's banks to recognize that they could not do business by taking in money from the African American community and not investing money in the African American community. The creation of BET, one of the most well watched national stations has also been a recipient and beneficiary of affirmative action. Lastly I would say, Mr. Speaker, that the important thing is what our young people believe and how they will carry the torch into the 21st century. I hope and my challenge is that although they may not have lived through the time frame of Dr. Martin Luther King or Stokely Carmichael or any of the others who so aptly raised their voices for equal opportunity and freedom, I hope that they will never forget. I hope there is a sense of loyalty and understanding and guts that they would feel that the work that they do, wherever it might be, those who may work in the United States Congress, with many of the Members and particularly those of the Congressional Black Caucus, understand that they have a mission, that it is a challenge and an honor to be so associated, that many of the strides that have been made by African Americans have come from the Congressional Black Caucus. I challenge our educators and teachers: Teach our children about their history, do not have them scratching to find out about African American history because school boards and schools refuse to include those very important subjects in our curriculum. We all have a challenge. And to our African American businesses across the Nation, not to the exclusion of small businesses or Hispanic businesses or women-owned businesses, you have a special responsibility to give back to your community. I know that you live there. I know that you are giving. Let that be your cause. My final word is to simply say that black history must be lived and not spoken. That means that we are all challenged to live African American history and the contributions to this Nation every single day. God bless you.","word.count":1198,"sep11":-3.67415730337079,"years":1998.18539325843,"days":1134,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.290357713979123,"Topic 2":0.0767140589263371,"Topic 3":0.025301208375259,"Topic 4":0.065907313128365,"Topic 5":0.00529848923953319,"Topic 6":0.00893845954885684,"Topic 7":0.0129624150188422,"Topic 8":0.0167960658910922,"Topic 9":0.492024225909647,"Topic 10":0.00570004998294456},{"id":"10720020018104","body":"Maurice Hinchey: Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment.

It's unfortunate the debate has deteriorated into pro-choice and pro-life labels because, in reality, it is a hugely significant conflict over when life begins and what life comprises. That's perhaps why it divides people along unpredictable lines; even in my State of Idaho, people of like political beliefs can take different positions on this issue. I mention this because today we are dealing with an aspect of the abortion issue that even causes divisions among those who generally find abortion acceptable. What we saw in the House of Representatives just a few days ago demonstrated this. The overwhelming vote in support of the bill included many who usually identify themselves as pro- choice. Let me repeat that: Even those who accept abortion found this particular procedure so objectionable they voted in favor of banning it. A ban is an extraordinary step for Congress to take--but then, this is an extreme and hideous abortion procedure. We've heard it described in detail; we've seen diagrams that those performing this procedure have certified to be accurate. And Mr. President, I have seen strong men and women look away, to avoid dealing with the reality of this procedure. I urge any of my colleagues who have reservations about this bill to take the time to understand exactly what's involved. Then you will understand why even abortion proponents draw the line here. To put it simply, we're talking about causing and then stopping a delivery, to kill a baby mere inches and seconds before he or she is protected by our laws as a living human being. Some would like to defend this procedure by claiming it is only used when the life of the mother is at stake or when the baby is shown to have genetic deformities. However, the testimony from those who perform these late-term abortions contradicts these arguments. Even Dr. Martin Haskell, who originated the technique, estimated as many as 80 percent of the procedures he performed were elective, not for genetic or life- saving reasons. It's important to note that this bill contains an exception for situations in which the life of the mother truly is at stake and no other procedure can save it. Those who are honestly worried about this issue should be reassured. But it's also important to note that this procedure is hardly risk-free to the mother; medical professionals agree it poses dangers to both the lives and the future reproductive health of the women involved. Mr. President, we all are thankful for today's life-saving advances in medical technology. It's appalling to think this particular procedure twists those advances in a legalistic game, with a human life in the balance. In closing, I urge all my colleagues not to let political labels blind them to the facts. This radical, barbaric procedure goes much too far. Let's draw the line here, now, and pass the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act.","word.count":501,"sep11":-5.99438202247191,"years":1995.86516853933,"days":308,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0123140731752903,"Topic 2":0.209588102971079,"Topic 3":0.00325234468277377,"Topic 4":0.03719146741277,"Topic 5":0.00364354866484991,"Topic 6":0.0105846657784062,"Topic 7":0.582548380982299,"Topic 8":0.00410703192308823,"Topic 9":0.127292051794684,"Topic 10":0.00947833261475967},{"id":"10920050013343","body":"Mike Ferguson: Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word","word.count":326,"sep11":3.79494382022472,"years":2005.65449438202,"days":3793,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.00767905492862311,"Topic 2":0.0159279055794294,"Topic 3":0.00332730020042327,"Topic 4":0.00489997763329913,"Topic 5":0.00188774249432914,"Topic 6":0.00597763208485879,"Topic 7":0.131423926518522,"Topic 8":0.0365255984718613,"Topic 9":0.78803688771416,"Topic 10":0.00431397437449328},{"id":"10920050034035","body":"Debbie Wasserman Schultz: Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Alaska and the gentleman from Oregon each will control 20 minutes.

It is these men and women, past and present, who embody the ideals of freedom, liberty and justice, which are the foundation of our great Nation. Veterans Day is a time to recognize those Americans who gave what President Abraham Lincoln once called ``the last full measure of devotion.'' While we reflect on the deeds of these heroes and stand grateful for their service and sacrifice, we must also ponder the ongoing actions of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines. Ours is a great Nation of free people who call our finest men and women to stand guard and protect the liberty that all Americans enjoy. To this end, all of those who have donned the uniform of our Armed Forces have consciously given a piece of themselves. Whether during peacetime or a time of conflict; at home or abroad; in the active component, the reserves or the national guard; their service has been characterized by selflessness and a sense of a greater purpose. Throughout our history, they have answered the call. Whether that call to service sent them to a distant land full of turmoil, or to the flight line at a base in the Midwest, they have served with dignity and honor. I am proud that my home State of Texas has a rich tradition of military leadership. Our young men and women have signed up to serve their Nation and are stationed throughout the United States and in all corners of the globe. More Marines join the Corps from Texas per capita than any other State. And we are home to more Army and Air Force bases than any State. As these men and women have sacrificed, so too has a far less recognized segment of our Veteran population--their spouses. For each displaced serviceman, there is often a husband or wife left behind. These silent patriots have kissed their loved ones goodbye and sent them off to serve this country. They diligently run their households while their mate provides security at an airport in another part of the country or serves on a foreign base halfway around the globe. They have often put their career on hold and patiently moved the family to the next in a long series of new bases and new communities. Whatever accolades we bestow upon our Veterans, we must also remember the parallel sacrifice of their heroic spouses. Today our troops are answering the call to duty in locations around the world. The war on terrorism is being waged by America's finest, from Afghanistan to the Philippines. Soldiers in South Korea continue to keep watch on the communist regime to their North. Air Force pilots continue to patrol the skies over Iraq as the world contemplates the future of the region. Reservists and National Guardsmen continue to serve, at the expense of their civilian vocations, on extended active duty for a year or more. Some of our military patriots continue to serve well beyond the date they were to leave active service because the Nation continues to need their expertise. On this Veterans Day, we express our heartfelt gratitude to our Nation's veterans and to their spouses. We have incurred a debt to them that can never be fully repaid. Today we remember those who have gone before and honor tomorrow's veterans who serve our country today.","word.count":568,"sep11":1.19943820224719,"years":2003.05898876404,"days":2869,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0128402185426547,"Topic 2":0.0204555848465531,"Topic 3":0.00839920828296046,"Topic 4":0.016005826424083,"Topic 5":0.0030865443568147,"Topic 6":0.0055748585655415,"Topic 7":0.279562527426771,"Topic 8":0.0994737375602984,"Topic 9":0.549792389456473,"Topic 10":0.00480910453785027},{"id":"11020080042214","body":"Arlen Specter: I thank the Chair. The current presidential race provides the Senate with a unique opportunity to come to grips with the confirmation process of Federal judges and to make some very fundamental commitments and very fundamental changes to our process. We are in the midst of a Presidential campaign, and I think it is fair to say the outcome is uncertain. It has fluctuated tremendously on both nomination pictures. But, this is a time, with the outcome uncertain, when neither side of the aisle would know who will gain an advantage; we would not know whose ox was being gored. It is a time, starting in the next Congress--if we can't act now, and my fundamental plea is that we act at the present time--we ought not to wait 11 months, until January 20, 2009. This is a unique time to tackle the problem for the future. On April 1, 2004, I offered S. Res. 327, and I now offer the substance of that resolution again. The whereas clauses of the resolution recited a distressing array of facts similar to what we have at the present time, with filibusters by the Democrats and with the retaliatory prospect of changing the filibuster rule. The resolution called for establishing a timetable for hearings of nominees for district courts and courts of appeal and the Supreme Court to occur within 30 days after the names of such nominees have been submitted to the Senate by the President and then to establish a timetable for action by the full committee within 30 days after the hearings and for reporting out nominees to the full Senate. And then to have a timetable for the full Senate to act within 90 days, with a provision for reasonable extension of times, upon agreement of the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the ranking member or the majority leader and the minority leader to extend the time. This resolution would establish procedures which would guarantee that the confirmation of judges would go back to the good old days, where you took a look at the person's academic credentials, you took a look at the person's professional background, you interviewed the individual, you had an FBI background check, and the person didn't have to pass some ideological purity test. Or, the individual did not have to pass a test such as what Judge Southwick was subjected to on this floor for months and months and months. It was particularly egregious in the case of Judge Southwick. Judge Southwick was a distinguished Mississippi State appellate court judge. He was nominated for the Fifth Circuit, and he had an extraordinary record, more than 10 years on the State court bench--more than 70 opinions. Objections were raised to two lines in two concurring opinions. Judge Southwick left the bench and went to Iraq and served for months in the Judge Advocate General's Corps. He was interviewed by many people of the Senate, and his confirmation hung on a thread until a courageous Senator from the other side of the aisle crossed party lines and led the way to get a few votes from the Democrats. You don't have to be a profile in courage to support a judge such as Judge Southwick, and you don't have to be a profile in courage to support a nominee such as Rod Rosenstein or Peter Keisler or Robert Conrad or the others who were enumerated in my letter--some 10 circuit court judges and 18 district court judges. I wish to quote a very respectable authority in my concluding comment. A man who has served in the Senate since he was elected from Vermont in 1974, twice chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and this is what the distinguished Senator from Vermont, Senator Leahy, had to say on October 5, 2000. This is the last year of President Clinton's administration. This is Senator Leahy. Going on. He was in the campaign process at that time in the 2000 election. Senator Leahy says: Senator Leahy, you were right on October 5, 2000, and you are right on March 3, 2008.

Senator Coleman and I went there immediately the morning after the bridge collapsed on August 1 and saw firsthand what happened. I came back and reported the bravery of our citizens, the emergency responders immediately diving in, people who were off duty coming to the scene, ordinary citizens running in saving people among shards of steel, among rebar, diving in, risking their own lives. There was a miracle schoolbus there where little kids could have died. But one man, who didn't even know those kids, opened the door and let them out. This is what happened in Minnesota that day. Then we returned to this body and worked with our fellow Senators. Not one Senator objected to the idea that when a Federal bridge falls in the middle of America, we must rebuild it. When a Federal highway overpass falls in the middle of America, we must rebuild it. At that time, when we only had 60 hours to get the authorization for the $250 million that we requested to rebuild that bridge, we were told to wait until the dust settled to figure out the details of the appropriation. That seemed like a good idea. The dust has settled. We have learned in our State and in our community that 13 people died in that tragedy, ordinary people coming home, going to work, people such as Patrick Holmes, who was driving home to his young wife Jennifer and their two children; people such as Sadiya Sahal, a pregnant nursing student, and her 2-year-old daughter Hannah, who were headed to a relative's home when the bridge crumbled beneath them. Many people were injured. Many people died. That is what happened when the dust settled. We now have a gaping hole in a major bridge in the middle of Minneapolis-St. Paul, a major metropolitan area. Any of our Members, or anyone who is listening today, would think about major metropolitan areas in their States, if there was suddenly a gaping hole. The bridge basically buckled into the Mississippi River. It is eight blocks from my home, so I see it every day. It is costing an estimated $400,000 a day in lost business, lost time. There are a number of other bridges, but they are very small. Traffic has built up. The emergency response from the Federal Government has been strong. The response from the State has been strong. Within 12 hours after this tragedy, billboards were up about emergency bus service. People responded in the right way, including the Senate and Congress. But on that day, 60 hours after this happened, a promise was made that we would rebuild that bridge. I appreciated the amendment to build bridges and to help repair bridges across this country. I supported it, as did my colleague, Senator Coleman. But we knew this was not the money that had been allocated to fix our bridge in Minnesota. Oftentimes when these tragedies happen, it does lead to help across the country. When we realized that levees needed to be looked at, when we realized that flood control systems needed to be built after the Grand Forks flood--a lot of things happen that help other people in the country, but we always first help the people where the tragedy occurs. That is what our amendment--Senator Coleman is a cosponsor--is about, to make sure we fund the bridge repair, that we fix the bridge. A bridge in the middle of America just doesn't fall down. We will get to the bottom of what happened. But when it does fall down, we rebuild it. We fix it. I thank the Senate for its consideration.","word.count":623,"sep11":6.15449438202247,"years":2008.01404494382,"days":4633,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0951979952122173,"Topic 2":0.031976126649729,"Topic 3":0.0157302077463063,"Topic 4":0.368189639093196,"Topic 5":0.00648458583809381,"Topic 6":0.00850264332503145,"Topic 7":0.0129532228477398,"Topic 8":0.228241087142438,"Topic 9":0.212732952219231,"Topic 10":0.0199915399260169},{"id":"10820040029276","body":"Stevan Pearce: Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3334 sponsored by the gentleman from California is another step towards drought-proofing southern California.

Mikulski: Mr. President, I rise today to express my thanks and appreciation to Chairman Levin and Senator Warner for their outstanding efforts on the bipartisan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009. I would especially like to recognize Senator Warner for his stewardship of this bill this year, and his determined role managing the bill on the floor over the last few weeks. Senator Warner has played a role in most of the Defense authorization bills over the last 40 years. His sage counsel and steady hand on the rudder are an invaluable asset to the Senate in meeting our commitment to our men and women in uniform. I would like to thank the committee for supporting $1.3 billion in military construction and base realignment and closure funding for Maryland's military installations. This funding is especially critical to ensuring that the BRAC transition of Walter Reed Army Hospital to the National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, MD, stays on track. We owe it to our wounded warriors and their families to give them world class medical facilities that they deserve. This bill also makes great strides in continuing to focus on the Dole-Shalala recommendations that outline the best courses of action for improving the quality of care for our wounded warriors. This bill requires the Department of Defense to establish Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and Traumatic Brain Injury Centers of Excellence and conduct pilot programs to better treat these disorders. The bill will also require that the Department of Defense to develop uniform standards and procedures for disability evaluations of recovering servicemembers across military departments. I commend the committee for continuing to make quality military health care a priority. This legislation provides vitally important increases in authorized funding for our National Guard. This bill shows a clear and substantial commitment to restore and improve the homeland defense capabilities and readiness of our National Guard. I am very pleased that the committee increased the authorization of the Army's procurement budget by $391.2 million for dual-purpose equipment in support of National Guard readiness.

On March 22, 2000, forty-seven CEOs of high technology companies, Presidents of our leading universities, and representatives of labor organizations came together in an unprecedented Council on Competitiveness letter petitioning Congress for ``significantly higher long-term investments in our national science and technology enterprise.'' This investment, they stated, should come in the form of increased ``public-sector investments in frontier research'' such as research in the ``[p]hysical sciences, math, and engineering.'' This letter also includes a clear warning--Congressional failure to appropriate more funding for science and technology research will threaten America's competitive advantage in information technology, biotechnology, health science, new materials, and other critical technology-intensive fields. As we all know, many economists, including Alan Greenspan, have asserted that our country's leadership in these areas is an important reason for our current economic success. A refusal to support America's dominant position with adequate appropriations today threatens our economic success tomorrow. The Council on Competitiveness letter also reveals that increased federal funding to science and technology will positively affect another key policy issue--the scarcity of technologically skilled workers. The debate over whether to raise the number of H1-B visas has alerted all of us to the technology industry's critical need for more highly skilled workers. In the New Economy large numbers of ``knowledge-based'' workers are essential to economic growth. Because we are not training enough American knowledge-based workers, high-tech companies have asked Congress to increase the number of H1-B visas granted to skilled workers who are willing to immigrate from other countries. Appropriating more funding for science and technology research will increase the number of technologically trained Americans, thus addressing the current scarcity of knowledge-based workers. The letter explains that: ``Education and training of scientists and engineers are tied to federally sponsored research performed in the nation's laboratories and universities. When federal R&amp;D commitments shrink, so too does the pool of technically trained talent, forcing industry and academia to look abroad for skilled knowledge workers.'' I therefore urge all my colleagues who support increasing the H1-B cap to support increased federal science and technology funding--we must develop more American technology workers. It is important to understand that this letter's signatories are not alone in their recommendation for more substantial funding for science and technology research. The House Science Committee wisely wrote in a 1998 study titled ``Unlocking Our Future: Toward a New National Science Policy'' that ``[t]he federal investment in science has yielded stunning payoffs. It has spawned not only new products, but also entire industries. To build upon the strength of the research enterprise, we must make federal research funding stable and substantial, maintaining diversity in the federal research portfolio, and promoting creative, ground breaking research.'' Similarly, a Business Week editorial on July 26, 1999 stated that ``[b]ecause of productivity gains, the economy can now operate at a higher speed without inflation. . . . [P]romoting the New Economy also requires wise policy from Washington. We need to support basic research and education at all levels, the seed corn of innovation.'' These arguments are supported by noted MIT economist Lester Thurow in a June, 1999 Atlantic Monthly article, where he comments that: ``[a] successful knowledge based economy requires large public investments in education, infrastructure, and research and development. . . . Private rates of return on R&amp;D spending average about 24 percent. But societal rates of return on R&amp;D spending are about 66 percent. . . . This result, never contradicted in the economic literature, provides powerful evidence that there are huge positive social spillovers from research and development . . . Because the government doesn't care exactly which Americans reap the benefits, it has a very important role to play in R&amp;D. Rates of return on R&amp;D spending are far above those found elsewhere in the economy. Government now pays for about 30 percent of total R&amp;D, but with a 66 percent rate of return it should be spending much more.'' In recognition of this need for greater public support of science and technology research, last year the Senate unanimously passed the Federal Research Investment Act . This bill would double our investment in civilian science and technology over the next decade. The Administration also understands how critical publicly funded R&amp;D is to the country's vitality. Its budget includes a strong and balanced program which will begin to recharge our sagging R&amp;D portfolio. The administration's program is consistent with the spirit and the text of the Federal Research Investment Act and the Council on Competitiveness letter. Unfortunately, our Congressional Budget Resolution calls only for a small increase in federal investments in science and technology. We have a chance to make an important investment in our country's future and to lay the groundwork for continued American high-tech leadership. I urge my colleagues to heed our high-tech, academic, and labor leaders' call to action on federal R&amp;D support and work together to achieve more substantial appropriations for science and technology.","word.count":847,"sep11":-1.39044943820225,"years":2000.4691011236,"days":1947,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.905634041245646,"Topic 2":0.0286005058203681,"Topic 3":0.00637364159583361,"Topic 4":0.0145786427232292,"Topic 5":0.00909147607497268,"Topic 6":0.00785812880322479,"Topic 7":0.0039392612540432,"Topic 8":0.0156706295636446,"Topic 9":0.00527388329509615,"Topic 10":0.00297978962394169},{"id":"10419960033258","body":"Carolyn B.

The Republican bill puts more money in the system. The Democratic bill limits the amount, voluntarily limits contributions, expenditures, and limits soft money.

Currently, church-sponsored employee benefit plans are exempt from ERISA and therefore are not exempt from state insurance laws like other employer-sponsored plans. Even so, these plans have generally operated as if they were exempt from state law. It is unfair for church plans to be potentially subject to greater regulations than other employer- sponsored plans, and it does not make sense to subject church employee benefit plans to state insurance laws that are not designed or equipped to deal with these unique plans. My home state of Minnesota is one of four states that already provides an exemption for church plans. However, church plans have no legal certainty when they provide benefits in the remaining 46 states. This has caused many insurers to refuse to do business with church plans because these plans could be considered unlicensed entities. Last year, I heard from the Board of Pensions of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, headquartered in Minneapolis, about the need to clarify the status of church benefit plans. I especially appreciated the advice and counsel of Bob Rydland and John Kapanke about this urgent problem affecting more than one million clergy and lay workers across the United States. Because the rules affecting church plans are found in the tax code, I asked Chairman Archer of the Ways and Means Committee, with the support of 13 bipartisan colleagues, to support a legislative correction to this problem. I am pleased this legislation before us today accomplishes our objective. S. 1309 will clarify that church employee benefit plans are not insurance companies under state insurance laws. This bill was crafted with the help of state insurance commissioners, and it does not prevent states from enacting legislation targeted at these plans. I am also grateful to Chairman Boehner and Ranking Member Andrews of the Education and Workforce Subcommittee on Employer-Employee Relations for their work on this important issue. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation to protect the employee benefits of America's church workers.","word.count":217,"sep11":-2.25561797752809,"years":1999.60393258427,"days":1639,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.264871147172241,"Topic 2":0.0539128670018686,"Topic 3":0.00876853190867086,"Topic 4":0.0154736452162749,"Topic 5":0.358103007215412,"Topic 6":0.00507747331830501,"Topic 7":0.00316480681346017,"Topic 8":0.174376425484817,"Topic 9":0.00715158933085302,"Topic 10":0.109100506538098},{"id":"10920050016888","body":"Tom Lantos: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I recognize the point of order. Mr. Chairman, it was just yesterday we were on this floor honoring the work of former President Dwight Eisenhower and also celebrating the 50th anniversary of the national interstate highway system. That system that he was the champion of for a number of years beforehand and finally got done, that system that we today bear the fruit, enjoy the fruit of. That system that was, in essence, put in place to connect border to border, east to west, north to south, the major urban areas and the city areas of this country, primarily for a national defense purposes was what the President had in mind. That system, as I say, was started 50 years ago. That system, of course, was also completed 20 years ago. And as I mentioned on the floor just yesterday, I believe that the former President and great general that he was, would want us, as we go into the second half of that century to be able to stand on his shoulders of the work that he was able to accomplish and now move on to a more progressive and appropriate system for this century. Under the current system, it is sort of a top-down approach as far as transportation dollars are concerned. Even though States spend twice as much money on our transportation system in the country than the Federal Government does, we are all aware of the fact that there is an 18-cent gasoline tax in every State. That money comes from your respective State to Washington, D.C., through the hands of the bureaucrats down here where the decisions are made and then reallocated with the things that we read about in the paper as well as far as some of the programs and dollars where they are spent. Things that our taxpayers probably just scratch their head and wonder what is Washington doing with those dollars. I would gather the local officials, county, municipal and State officials also wonder just what Washington is doing with those transportation dollars as well. To that end, I have introduced legislation called the Surface Transportation and Taxation Equity Act, the STATE Act for short. And that is a piece of legislation that simply says this: That States should be allowed, if they so desire, to opt out of the Federal gasoline and transportation system and make those decisions right at home instead. See, right now, States are either donor States or donee States. States like the State of New Jersey, which is my own, is a donor State. We send more to Washington as far as gasoline taxes than we ever get back in return, so we are, in effect, subsidizing the other States. But even donee States, even those States that think that they are doing well by this system, may not be. And the reason I say that is this. Even though they are getting a little bit more, a few pennies back on the dollar more than they send to Washington, the problem is there are strings attached to those dollars. Washington just doesn't turn those dollars back to those donee States nor in to the donor States without any restrictions. They don't turn them back carte blanche. Washington, the bureaucrats, put restrictions on them. But what exactly do those restrictions cost the States? What do they cost through the micro- management that Washington does to those States? What does it cost those respective States inasmuch as they are not able to spend the dollars as the citizens of those States feel are most appropriate? What does it cost at the end of the day in wasted Federal and local taxes? So what this amendment does, to get to the bottom of it, is simply do a study. Let's get the facts. Let's find out what it is, in fact, costing the States to comply with this top-down, inefficient, outdated system of funding and building our roads and bridges across this country. This amendment simply asks the U.S. Department of Transportation to conduct a study to determine the amount each State spends to comply with the regulations of the USDOT and whether or not there are programs that they are spending on that the sovereign States do not intend for them to spend it on. So in the end this is simply an amendment asking for a study to ask for full disclosure so that we both in Washington and at the local level and the taxpayers as well know exactly where their dollars are going to, where they are coming from and whether they are being put to the best use. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.","word.count":245,"sep11":3.85955056179775,"years":2005.7191011236,"days":3816,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.417522607864216,"Topic 2":0.385023922936878,"Topic 3":0.0103569388018323,"Topic 4":0.020704596504639,"Topic 5":0.0108887700367939,"Topic 6":0.0284835659709477,"Topic 7":0.0071935187048082,"Topic 8":0.0265160906052402,"Topic 9":0.081273852422651,"Topic 10":0.0120361361519941},{"id":"11020080018665","body":"Shelley Moore Capito: Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from New York for her support of this bill, and I am very excited it is before the House today. There is a very special bond that exists between mothers and their children that words cannot describe. For the lucky ones among us, a mother--our, someone else's, or a mother figure such as a grandmother-- has made all of the difference in our lives. The tender care, unending support, and the unconditional love of a mother truly are life's greatest blessing for a child. Every year on the second Sunday in May this Nation honors its mothers. We seek to acknowledge their tireless support and their enduring love. My colleague has spoken about how this tradition began, but I would like to go over it because it is a proud history of tradition for our State of West Virginia. In 1868, Anna Reeves Jarvis organized a committee in her home town of Grafton, West Virginia, to sponsor a mother's friendship day. The purpose was to reunite families that had been divided during the Civil War. However, Anna Reeves Jarvis' dream of an annual memorial Mother's Day commemorating each mother for the service she renders to humanity had not gained wide-spread support during her lifetime. However, her daughter, Anna M. Jarvis, took on her mother's cause. On May 9, 1907, the second anniversary of her mother's death, Anna invited friends to her home and outlined her plan to make her mother's dream of a nationwide day in honor of mothers a reality. Within a year, working with Andrews Methodist Episcopal Church, progress was made and on Sunday, May 10, 1908, church services were held in which mothers were honored. They were held in Grafton, West Virginia, and in Philadelphia. This initial celebration was only the beginning. Jarvis worked for years to popularize her idea. She wrote letters to churches and business leaders, to newspaper editors and to Members of Congress. She was even able to bring the drive for a Mother's Day observance to the attention of the President of the United States. Her efforts were rewarded. In 1910, the governor of West Virginia, William Glassock, issued a Mother's Day proclamation. By the next year, Mother's Day services were held in all States of the Union. In 1914, President Woodrow Wilson, responding to a joint resolution in Congress, issued a proclamation setting aside the second Sunday every May for ``displaying the American flag as a public expression of our love and reverence for the mothers of our country.'' Today, Mother's Day is celebrated throughout the world. In the United States, the President and governors issue proclamations recognizing mothers, churches perform services in honor of mothers everywhere, and the hearts of all are filled with all of our love for our mothers. This bill would authorize the minting of silver $1 coins in honor of the women who have sacrificed so much for their children. It is a small token of our love and admiration, but one that will hopefully express the love we hold for our mothers. Surcharges of the sale of the coins, as my colleague mentioned, will go to the Susan G. Komen Foundation and the National Osteoporosis Foundation for research. I chose both of these foundations because I have great admiration for the work they do for men and women, but particularly for women as we battle the difficult tragedies of breast cancer and the growing difficulties associated with osteoporosis which over 80 percent of the people it strikes are women. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this resolution, but I would like to take this opportunity to thank my mother. She has made a difference in my life. I appreciate her unconditional love and support, her willingness to help me when I fell, and to push me forward when I could not find the strength myself. I love you, Mom, and thanks. With that, being from West Virginia, I would like to say, too, that our sense of community and family is very strong. We are so very proud of Anna Jarvis' vision, her idea and her dedication to celebrate her own mother, and we are proud to be known as the birthplace of Mother's Day. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.","word.count":724,"sep11":6.92134831460674,"years":2008.7808988764,"days":4906,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.108579063204551,"Topic 2":0.165804334782018,"Topic 3":0.00440284005291797,"Topic 4":0.0234922661338281,"Topic 5":0.00481545583502347,"Topic 6":0.00396158256495656,"Topic 7":0.430899976484191,"Topic 8":0.00851051880928655,"Topic 9":0.238561132455418,"Topic 10":0.0109728296778091},{"id":"10419960024721","body":"Doug Bereuter: Mr. Chairman, this Member rises today in opposition to the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona [Mr. Shadegg] to decrease funding for the National Endowment for the Humanities [NEH] by $12 million.

An additional 11-percent cut would seriously undermine NEH and, most importantly, the State humanities councils that are already working diligently to replace decreasing Federal funds with private contributions. This Member is most familiar with the National Endowment for the Humanities in the form of the Nebraska Humanities Council which consistently provides high-quality humanities programming at very little cost to citizens of all walks of life in my State. Since 1973, they have funded programs in more than 200 different communities in all of Nebraska's 93 counties--reaching more communities each year. Some of those counties have fewer than 500 residents and have meager cultural resources. The Nebraska Humanities Council has been especially effective at reaching residents in the 1st Congressional District of Nebraska.

The council has developed a humanities resource center with a large speakers bureau, exhibits, films, and videos that enable the smallest communities to benefit from the cultural resources of Nebraska's metropolitan areas. The speakers bureau has been particularly helpful to Nebraska's schools as they comply with a new requirement for multicultural education. Of course, the humanities council does not charge the schools for this valuable educational service.

Snowe: Mr. President, as we celebrate National Small Business Week, which runs April 21 through April 25, 2008, I rise in support of a Senate Resolution--which I introduced along with Chairman Kerry, and other members of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship--that honors the entrepreneurial spirit of our Nation's nearly 27 million small businesses and the tremendous contributions they make to our economy. Small businesses are the driving force behind our nation's economic growth and job creation. Representing 99 percent of all employers, small businesses create nearly \\3/5\\ of all net new jobs and generate more than 50 percent of the Nation's nonfarm gross domestic product. They are the foundation, the engine, the core of our economy. Clearly, the greatest source of jobs in this country are the small businesses that are constantly responding to new challenges with innovations and creativity. As Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I have made it one of my top priorities to be an advocate for small businesses, and to help raise the needs and concerns of our countries' job creators. With more than 600,000 small businesses having opened in 2006, this is clearly a sector that deserves our accolades, recognition, and support. Indeed, hope embodies the spirit of the 26.8 million small business owners. They are willing to take risks that others don't, they transform their ideas and dreams into realities, their hobbies become their professions, and their entrepreneurial spirit can be seen in the products and services that make up America. Frankly, this week as we celebrate our Nation's entrepreneurs, we will undoubtedly fall short of fully recognizing what our country's small businesses truly add to our economy. Given the sluggish state of our economy, it is all the more imperative that we fully equip our small businesses, our true job generators, and provide them with the tools--not just to mitigate and stem this crisis--but to be a catalyst for helping to address and ultimately solve it. We must take advantage of the opportunities to help our small businesses thrive. We in Congress should reduce their tax burdens, ensure they receive the business counseling they deserve, and that they have affordable and reliable health insurance options for their employees. One of our most valuable assets for ensuring the success of small businesses is the Small Business Administration, SBA. The SBA is pivotal in overseeing the delivery of financial and business development tools for millions of aspiring entrepreneurs and existing small businesses across the United States. With the SBA being the only Federal agency with the mandate to foster small business growth, we must work to provide the agency with the resources needed to help our nation's entrepreneurs right this economy. So as we celebrate our Nation's small businesses, we must be mindful of Congress's responsibility to ensure that each business has the opportunity to flourish. When accounting for inflation the SBA has seen its core lending and business development program budget cut by 28 percent since 2001, and this trend must simply be reversed. While the SBA touts its ``doing more with less,'' the agency's resources, programs, and employees are stretched too thin, which in the end negatively impacts our Nation's small business and the economy as a whole. As we look ahead, rest assured, I will not hesitate to take action and ensure that this vital sector continues to have the valuable resources it deserves. The SBA has been, and will continue to be, a critical partner to millions of small enterprises as well as aspiring entrepreneurs as they embark on the path to prosperity and job creation. The least we can do is strengthen, not erode, the SBA's core loan and technical assistance programs that have proven time and again to be the keystone in aiding the efforts and dreams of America's entrepreneurs. Today we celebrate our Nation's entrepreneurs and honor America's small businesses. I urge my colleagues to show their support for the small businesses in their states and support this resolution. We must remember that this country's future will be determined by today's small businesses, and the faster we can help them create more jobs, the quicker the economy will rebound, and the stronger its foundation will be.","word.count":706,"sep11":6.78370786516854,"years":2008.64325842697,"days":4857,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0151372167374306,"Topic 2":0.0955625905817363,"Topic 3":0.00533696453533952,"Topic 4":0.0102811508339777,"Topic 5":0.00368165520944486,"Topic 6":0.0293988466914705,"Topic 7":0.0109737963311391,"Topic 8":0.018795587904467,"Topic 9":0.806623924407709,"Topic 10":0.00420826676728483},{"id":"10619990037414","body":"Sheila Jackson-Lee: Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California and the gentleman from the gentleman from New Mexico each will control 20 minutes.

I just want to point out for those interested in preserving this bureaucracy, that is not a goal of mine particularly, but I just want to make it clear the tax credit proposal does not touch this bureaucratic model. We are not messing with the Department of Education laws or the bureaucracy in any way. We are changing the Tax Code, which is different. But this whole bureaucracy is going to continue to grow. If history has shown us anything, it is that it does not matter who is in charge of Washington, whether it is a Republican or Democrat, this bureaucracy grows by massive proportions from year to year, and that is not something to be proud about or brag about from my standpoint as a conservative, but that is the reality. For those who believe that a tax credit means that there will be fewer dollars spent in the traditional bureaucratic way in schools, Arizona is a perfect example. Arizona passed a tax credit proposal similar to what we are proposing here and the result was actually a benefit to Arizona's public school finance law. What happened was the per-pupil operating level actually increased in Arizona schools, and, not only that, but the Arizona school finance laws continued on without any change or any amendments to the way the school finance acts works in Arizona.

The two goals of the underlying bill are to improve PTO operations and to end fee diversion. This amendment makes sure those goals are achieved. In order to eliminate the incentive to divert fees from the PTO, the amendment establishes a rebate program that will deposit any fee collections that exceed the amount of money appropriated to the PTO in a ``reserve fund.'' At the end of each year, the PTO Director will determine whether there are sufficient funds to make payments to users who paid applicant fees that year. By ending fee diversion and allowing the PTO to keep the fees its users pay each year, the agency will be able to make many much-needed reforms to increase its efficiency and productivity. This amendment also contains provisions that will ensure the PTO will operate effectively. It establishes a pilot program to allow private entities to perform the search function associated with obtaining a patent. This will free up patent examiners to focus on other work. Some have mischaracterized this provision as ``outsourcing'' that will cut American jobs and send work overseas. In fact, this amendment specifies that participation in the pilot program is restricted to American businesses and American citizens. By allowing patent searches to be performed by commercial entities, this pilot program will simply allow the private sector to take some of the load off of an already overburdened patent evaluation system at the PTO. Twenty-five to thirty percent of the 355,000 patent applications the PTO receives each year come from small businesses. The Sensenbrenner amendment has many provisions to help small businesses obtain patents. The PTO is one of the most important agencies in the country. It is the agency behind the innovation and invention that drives our economy. We must give it the funding it needs to implement meaningful reform and improve its operations. This amendment strengthens the underlying bill and I urge my colleagues to support it.","word.count":342,"sep11":2.53932584269663,"years":2004.39887640449,"days":3346,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.232020546332609,"Topic 2":0.0654422531483331,"Topic 3":0.0674645071468605,"Topic 4":0.016268004815134,"Topic 5":0.00948485155684453,"Topic 6":0.0118879836074895,"Topic 7":0.0249700397728476,"Topic 8":0.131508271026628,"Topic 9":0.395561822848016,"Topic 10":0.045391719745238},{"id":"11020070030357","body":"Ike Skelton: Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX and the Chair's prior announcement, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed.","word.count":283,"sep11":5.94101123595506,"years":2007.80056179775,"days":4557,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0638354286429338,"Topic 2":0.0790041853266687,"Topic 3":0.122339950381523,"Topic 4":0.0444837594228731,"Topic 5":0.107848438313957,"Topic 6":0.0641721164732135,"Topic 7":0.0966898556529807,"Topic 8":0.063944561265223,"Topic 9":0.343643526560065,"Topic 10":0.0140381779605624},{"id":"10820030003438","body":"Sander Levin: Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Texas , who has done such a good job on framing the proper type of debate on this rule today and has done a good job on the rule. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 552 and the underlying bill itself, H.R. 339, the Personal Responsibility and Food Consumption Act. As original cosponsor of H.R. 339, I commend the gentleman from Florida for introducing, I think, a very important piece of legislation and the distinguished chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, the gentleman from Wisconsin , for working towards its passage. When this situation occurred, I think it was the first time in New York, and as a parent I can relate to this, it clearly pointed to the fact that a parent could not control their child, could not control how many times they went to a restaurant per day or where they went to, no form of responsibility. So they just ended up going with some plaintiffs' lawyers and they filed a lawsuit. Now, there are serious issues that have been discussed by both sides of the aisle about obesity and what, in fact, should happen, and exercise. And we can get into those issues. But I believe, Mr. Speaker, firmly, and I said it at the time the day those lawyers ran around and started this with the lawsuits, our judicial system that day was hijacked. It has been hijacked by greedy, blood-sucking, immoral plaintiffs' attorneys. They have made a ridiculous situation, and they have made the ridiculous the reality. What was once thought of as a hilarity on late-night comedy shows has been brought into mainstream media by absurd frivolous lawsuits. The situation really is not laughable, though it is scary. These actions are clogging our courts, driving our doctors out of practice, and are killing business growth in our great Nation, if we want to talk about jobs today. What is the purpose, you may ask? Will they promote social justice or make America safer? The answer is no. These suits are to line the pockets of America's trial bar. Contingency fees of 40 percent plus court costs leave lawyers enriched and their clients baffled. In big-time class actions, lawyers are hauling in fees that range as high as $30,000 per hour. I guarantee you that their clients are not receiving awards at that same rate. Now, Mr. Speaker, the same class-action lawyers that have sued other industries are turning towards our restaurant industry, pure and simple. They have held strategy sessions and seminars to hatch their schemes estimating they could reap hundreds of billions of dollars in settlements from the so-called obesity lawsuits. The lawsuits charge that children are overweight because of cheap fast food and aggressive food marketing by restaurants. But when you look at the underlying fact, it is clear that the American tort system is being exploited once again, pure and simple. Statistics from the National Bureau of Economic Research show that 60 percent of Americans' weight gain over the past 2 decade is attributable to increases in sedentary life-styles. The American Academy of Pediatrics has found that only 20 percent of children participated in daily physical education programs in 1999, compared to 80 percent in 1969. Nutritional data shows that teen obesity rose 10 percent in 1980 and the year 2000. Teens' caloric intake rose only 1 percent during that time, while their levels of physical activity dropped by 13 percent. Mr. Speaker, the judicial system is being used by industrious law firms and plaintiffs' lawyers who sue without repercussion. Their strategy is simple: sue until the defendants concede; once the restaurant company settles, the flood gates will open. As you can tell, I am not an attorney myself, I am a teacher by degree, but I have been around long enough to know that opening the flood gates of litigation is bad news. It is bad news for our courts. It is bad news for our doctors. It is bad news for business. It is ultimately bad news for America. The restaurant industry employs more than 12 million Americans. Restaurant companies lose just by being forced to defend these types of crazy lawsuits. They are forced to shift precious resources away from expanding their business and creating jobs and towards defending lawsuits solely filed to satisfy the insatiable appetites of the plaintiffs' bar. Mr. Speaker, it is the Congress's obligation to give American businesses the tools necessary to defend themselves from this type of litigation. There are proper times for lawsuits; I know that. There is a way to work at this. We have to look at exercise and education and responsibility within the restaurant industry and within the American population, period. But these insane and crazy lawsuits are absolutely not the way. I think the gentleman from Florida has a responsible approach to this problem.","word.count":521,"sep11":1.51966292134831,"years":2003.37921348315,"days":2983,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0313137439215908,"Topic 2":0.0527969866695097,"Topic 3":0.00683499939484079,"Topic 4":0.0159193154061893,"Topic 5":0.0067607062262813,"Topic 6":0.00381344598735527,"Topic 7":0.788720427911681,"Topic 8":0.0212431745288805,"Topic 9":0.065779160242294,"Topic 10":0.00681803971137707},{"id":"10519980044912","body":"Sam Brownback: Mr. President, I serve on the Foreign Affairs Committee and I note, last night an attempt was made on the life of President Eduard Shevardnadze of The Republic of Georgia by assailants who have yet to be identified. President Shevardnadze survived the attack without injury. Unfortunately several members of his personal security detail were killed, and number of others were wounded. The Republic of Georgia is one of the key linchpins of the new Eurasia. It is the most democratic of all of the states that succeeded the Soviet Union. Under President Shevardnadze's inspired leadership a civil war has been put to rest, criminals have been jailed, private armies have been disarmed, and economic decline has been reversed. In 1997, Georgia's economy grew by nearly 8 percent, inflation was held in check and the Georgian currency remained rock solid. Democracy has flourished. Indeed, if democracy is allowed to fail in Georgia, it is unlikely to succeed anywhere in the region. Any attempt to kill Shevardnadze must be seen in those context. It is an attempt to derail a successful democratic process, and an effort to compromise the growing number of U.S. economic and strategic interests in Georgia and the region. According to Georgian authorities, the attempted assassination was well-planned and well-executed by as many as 30 well-trained assailants. They were armed with rocket propelled grenades and automatic weapons. The Georgians are asking, as we must ask: How could a group this size operate undetected in the capital of Georgia? Where did they receive arms and ammunition? Who trained them? Where did they disappear to in the aftermath? And most importantly: Whose interests do they represent? Georgian authorities make it clear that they suspect outside powers of this attempt on the life of their president. They are not alone. Azerbaijan's president Aliyev was also the object of an assassination attempt in recent days, which Azerbaijani authorities believe was planned and executed by outsiders. We should be mindful that these two cowardly acts may be part of a plan to destabilize the Caucasus with the intention of scaring off American and other investors who seek to bring the Caspian's great energy wealth west to international markets. Who benefits from promoting instability in the Southern Caucasus at this time? Russia is everyone's leading candidate as the outside power with the most to gain. Russia has long raged and conspired to thwart Caspian energy from flowing any direction but north through Russia. Most parts of Russia's political elite still view Caspian wealth as their own. The suspected perpetrator of an earlier assassination attempt on Shevardnadze remains under Russian care despite vociferous demands from Georgia that he be extradited. Russia still has bases in Georgia from which yesterday's attack could be planned and staged. None of this is proof of Russian complicity, but the strong suspicion of Russian involvement will not go away quickly. The U.S. Government should make every effort to learn the truth. More than this, we must articulate in clear and forceful terms to those outside powers who might be tempted to destabilize the Caucasus some simple truths: First, the United States has vital interests in the Caucasus which these attacks threaten. Second, our support for President Shevardnadze and the other Caucasian leaders is unbending. Third, we will do everything we can to facilitate democracy and free markets in the region. Fourth, oil and gas will flow west. And finally, we must make it painfully evident that outside states that seek to destabilize America's friends in the Caucasus are not states we will favor with political and economic aid and other forms of assistance. The attempt to kill President Shevardnadze, one of America's most valued friends, is intolerable and will have consequences.","word.count":620,"sep11":-3.67696629213483,"years":1998.18258426966,"days":1133,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0277708652144927,"Topic 2":0.187172179368903,"Topic 3":0.0149813573143582,"Topic 4":0.144091889859233,"Topic 5":0.00902125958155754,"Topic 6":0.00466575427734248,"Topic 7":0.402157781449399,"Topic 8":0.0236232150271458,"Topic 9":0.164342007267197,"Topic 10":0.022173690640372},{"id":"10920060027308","body":"Bob Goodlatte: Madam Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time I will respond to the gentleman from Kentucky and the gentleman from New York, who called this a poison pill.

I think the gentleman from New York and I, while we may disagree on numbers, can agree that 90,000 is 10 percent of 900,000, not 1 percent. But whatever that is, that is a substantial number of unwanted horses. And, remember, the average life expectancy of a horse is 25 years. Many of these horses have many years of life expectancy left in them; so they are going to accumulate over a period of years. In fact, the American Veterinary Medical Association says over 6 years they will grow to 272,000 in number. That is far, far more than the capacity of all the horse sanctuaries around the country that exist today.

That has been a main point of contention on my part, that it is something that is doing damage to our judiciary and to the Senate. Today I want to talk about another aspect of that obstructionism. That is the tone and substance of the debate occurring on judges that are being put up, particularly for the circuit court. Yesterday we experienced something in the Judiciary Committee that I find beneath the dignity of the Senate and raises serious concerns about how we are going to attract good people to put their names before the Senate for confirmation to judicial office. I have behind me a copy from a Web site that displayed this cartoon that was the topic of discussion at yesterday's Judiciary Committee hearing on the supreme court justice of California, Janice Rogers Brown. She had a hearing yesterday before the committee and was greeted with this cartoon that was displayed on a Web site. The Web site of blackcommentator.com. The cartoon has President Bush and Justice Rogers Brown walking into a room and the President is saying: And then in the background are Justice Thomas, Colin Powell, and Condoleeza Rice. The bottom says: On the Web site, it says: I don't know from this Web site and I don't know from any other commentary I have seen what the relationship between this cartoon is and the People for the American Way and the NAACP, but I think it behooves both of those organizations to clarify their position on this cartoon which can be found in the following commentary by these two organizations. The stereotyping that goes on in this cartoon and the blatant racism that is displayed is overwhelming. To look at the depiction of Justice Brown, the picture speaks for itself. Let me show you a picture of what Justice Brown looks like. I would suggest the cartoon does not at all comport with what Justice Brown looks like. It is a purely slanderous depiction, stereotyping at its worst. That is the tone and substance of the debate we have now degraded ourselves into as a result of the obstructionism that is occurring for extreme political purposes in the Senate. Justice Brown was asked about this at her hearing yesterday. I quote what she said: She speaks not only for herself but she speaks to the hatchet job being done on Attorney General Pryor, being done to Judge Pickering, that was done to Miguel Estrada, is in the process of being done to Carolyn Kuhl and God knows how many more nominees who are being slandered and dragged through the mud, people of stellar reputations, a supreme court justice in California, reelected with 76 percent of the vote, a stellar educational record, and she is being treated in such a demeaning and degrading fashion. We had the attorney general of the State of Alabama who was questioned on his deeply held beliefs because he happens to be a conservative Catholic. Where are we going, folks? What are we turning this process into, that we will demean and degrade and tear down people for some extreme ideological agenda who have served this country, served their States, served their communities? This is wrong. We should stop this. If we don't stop it, it will go on and it will expand and grow like a cancer. That side is doing it now. If they keep it up, one day we may be doing it to them because, of course, we have to get them back for what they did to us. This is wrong. It has never been done before. Stop this insanity of degrading people, of coarsening the debate, of creating a chilling effect on those who would like to be Federal judges. It is wrong and it must stop now.

There will be those of us who will express it in different words than probably lawyers will. A couple of weeks ago we were visited and addressed by the Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard, when he related his feelings because he was in this country on September 11 of last year. He said that, since then, this country has reacted in a way that reestablishes or reconfirms the very values on which this country is based. Then we have a circuit court that comes down with a decision such as this. It is absolutely unbelievable. Can our children no longer sing ``God Bless America,'' or even ``America the Beautiful,'' or all the stanzas to our National Anthem? Do you want to take a look at the dollar bill? On the back of it is the symbol of this country, the eagle, and, of course, the eternal eye. This is a value-based society, and to say those who are sheltered from being removed from office, unless the crime is really something, but just for an opinion such as this, I find that unbelievable. We are a nation founded upon the acknowledgement of a Creator. It has been that way since day one, or even when the flame of freedom was ignited in the men and women way back in the 1700s. Men and women have died, given their lives, on the field of battle to protect it, just as they have another symbol of this country called our flag. It doesn't make a lot of sense. Of course, there are a lot of things that do not make sense in this world. I always refer to this place as 17 square miles of logic-free environment. Nonetheless, whenever you jump across the street, we find another logic that I fail to understand. So I will stand here and tell America that those values-- this being one of them--that those men and women did not die in vain. And it did not take very long for this body, that represents constituencies across the width and breath of our country, to react to it. That has to tell you something about who we are and what we are and how we got here.

This legislation will make it easier for individuals and employers to buy and keep health insurance--even when a family member or employee becomes ill. And it will allow people to change jobs without fear of losing their health coverage. Despite past State and Federal reform efforts, the lack of poor portability of health insurance remains a serious concern for many Americans, particularly those with preexisting health conditions. The General Accounting Office estimates that as many as 25 million Americans could benefit from this legislation. The Health Insurance Reform Act builds upon and strengthens the current private insurance market by, one, guaranteeing that private health insurance coverage will be available, renewable and portable; two, limiting preexisting condition exclusions; and, three, increasing the purchasing clout of individuals and small employers by creating incentives to form private, voluntary coalitions to negotiate with the providers and health plans. Mr. President, I believe that the American people want us to work together to fix what is broken in the current system without relying on big Government solutions. The legislation we are introducing today does not impose new, expensive regulatory requirements on individuals, employers or States. It does not create new Federal bureaucracies. It does not create any new taxes, spending or price controls nor does it require employers to pay for health insurance coverage. While this insurance reform legislation alone will not cure all the ills of the Nation's health care system, it will in some small and important ways, I believe, promote greater access and security for health coverage for all Americans by requiring private insurance carriers to compete based on quality, price, and service instead of by refusing to provide coverage to those who are in poor health and who need it the most. Mr. President, I want to thank all of my cosponsors. Senators Gregg, Frist, Jeffords, Hatch and Gorton have all contributed a great deal to this effort. Senator Jeffords has worked particularly hard on the group purchasing provisions of the legislation. But I want to especially recognize the contributions of the ranking member of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, Senator Kennedy. He has worked, along with his staff, for many hours, in many ways, to help make this legislation a bipartisan effort. Senator Kennedy has spent many years on the health care agenda working tirelessly to improve the health care delivery system. And I am particularly pleased that this is such a strong bipartisan bill that we are introducing today. It is not a major piece of legislation. As I said, it is not going to be the answer to all the ills in our health care system. But I think it is a very important step forward. I am confident that with the support of the other original cosponsors and others, the Labor Committee we will be able to report this legislation favorably in the near future and we can begin to move forward, on a bipartisan basis, to make private health insurance more readily available, more secure and more affordable for all Americans. Mr. President, I intend to work with all of my colleagues to ensure that these reforms are enacted during the 104th Congress.","word.count":561,"sep11":-6.32584269662921,"years":1995.53370786517,"days":190,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.29518181677445,"Topic 2":0.184721364297461,"Topic 3":0.309674093101259,"Topic 4":0.0182508037319475,"Topic 5":0.0185797402283918,"Topic 6":0.015325067867727,"Topic 7":0.080615397431652,"Topic 8":0.0596737069734775,"Topic 9":0.010914471903338,"Topic 10":0.00706353769029605},{"id":"10920060011918","body":"Mike Thompson: Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.

Compact-Impact Aid is the assistance that is annually given to the people of Guam as compensation for social and educational costs for the unrestricted migration of 3 newly-created independent States in the Central Pacific, the Compact States of the Republic of the Marshalls, the Republic of Palau and the Federated States of Micronesia. The President's budget for fiscal year 2001 proposes that Guam receive an increase of $5.42 million for Compact-Impact funding in the Department of Interior's Office of Insular Affair's budget, which would bring Guam's total to $10 billion annually. Last year, Guam received a total of $7.58 million, a 3.5 increase from previous years. From fiscal year 1996 to 1999, Guam received $4.58 million annually. Annual actual Compact-Impact costs for all of the social and educational costs to the government of Guam as a result of this free and unrestricted migration are actually estimated to be between $15 million to $20 million annually. Unfortunately, this year's Interior Appropriations provides only $4.58 million to Guam because of budgetary scoring problems that the House Committee on Appropriations had with the way in which the administration had identified the source of funding within the Office of Insular Affairs. This is a very serious issue which hopefully will be resolved in the context also of current renegotiations of these Compacts between the United States and the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. I simply want to emphasize that Compact-Impact Aid has been a Federal responsibility since 1986 which has only recently been addressed for Guam, and 1986 was the year that these Compacts went into effect. I understand that the House Committee on International Relations Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific will be holding an oversight hearing later on this month, and I certainly hope, and I plan to raise the issues of migration of FAS citizens at this important hearing. The issue of Compact-Impact Aid is not new. Funding authority for Compact-Impact assistance to Guam stems from the 1986 law which governs the relationship between the United States and these newly-created nations. Section 1046 pertains to impact costs and states: ``There are hereby authorized to be appropriated for fiscal years beginning after September 30, 1985 such sums as may be necessary to cover the costs, if any incurred, by the State of Hawaii, the territories of Guam and American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands resulting from any increased demands placed on educational and social services by immigrants from the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia.'' Since Guam is clearly the most economically developed island in the central Pacific and because of its geographical proximity, the vast majority of these immigrants come to Guam. Under the Compact Agreement, it also states that ``It was not the intent of the Congress to cause any adverse consequences for the U.S. territories and commonwealths or the State of Hawaii.'' It also states that if any adverse consequences occur, Congress will act sympathetically and expeditiously to redress these adverse consequences. We are now in the 15th year of the implementation of these contracts, and while I appreciate all of the sympathy that Congress could perhaps give on this issue, I certainly expect more expeditious action, particularly in the reimbursement of costs that are incurred directly by the taxpayers of Guam. Guam's unemployment rate is currently over 15 percent, and from mid 1997 to mid 1998, the total of Compact migrants to Guam was over 7,000. This is a population of 140,000, and this exceeds the numbers that are going to Hawaii and other areas. This is not the same as problems normally referred to in addressing the impact of immigrant issues in the 50 States. The obligation to Guam is clear in the law; the obligation is written into the treaties of free association between these new countries and the United States, and the obligation to the people of Guam is clear. I am hopeful that we will be able to work on this through the process of conferencing, and we are grateful for the fact that this still remains a high priority for the Clinton administration.","word.count":128,"sep11":-2.29775280898876,"years":1999.56179775281,"days":1624,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0590979707776855,"Topic 2":0.253268955217671,"Topic 3":0.140219638192397,"Topic 4":0.0153448973180759,"Topic 5":0.0631734817264183,"Topic 6":0.430568483918589,"Topic 7":0.00775097764714068,"Topic 8":0.0182789768949669,"Topic 9":0.00650648802207278,"Topic 10":0.005790130284982},{"id":"10419950022358","body":"Rosa L. DeLauro: Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to say I support this rule, which gives people on both sides of this issue a chance to be heard. It will allow the supporters of this shipbuilding trade agreement a chance to vote for the agreement and it will give others a chance to make changes. So, although I count myself as one of the people who would like to make changes, I am happy to say I support this rule because it will allow us to do so. Mr. Speaker, this shipping agreement is a good start. It takes some serious steps toward making the international business of shipbuilding fair for all shipbuilders--regardless of their nationality. It seeks to eventually eliminate shipbuilding subsidies; prevent dumping; and settle disputes. But, Mr. Speaker, this shipbuilding trade agreement is unbalanced. It does not do enough to protect American shipbuilders from unfair international shipbuilding subsidies. Unless we change that aspect of the agreement, unless we adopt the Bateman amendment, this agreement is unfair to American shipbuilders and shouldn't go any further. The Bateman amendment continues the title 11 loan guarantees at their current levels. In other words it will even the playing field for American shipbuilders in light of continued subsidies by foreign governments. Mr. Speaker, this agreement is the result of 5 years of negotiations among the major shipbuilding countries of the world. The goal is a very noble one, namely to end all shipbuilding subsidies in the year 1999. But, unfortunately, it appears that we have given away nearly the whole store and gotten just about nothing in return. Mr. Speaker, the creation of the title 11 loan guarantee program has jump started the American shipbuilding industry in recent years. It enables qualified shipbuilders to receive substantial loan guarantees from our Government for up to 87.5 percent of a loan over a 25-year period. Thanks to this program previously defunct shipyards, like the Quincy Shipyard in Massachusetts, have been able to get back on their feet. Mr. Speaker, this is the only government program designed to help U.S. shipbuilders, and it carries a price tag of $50 million annually. Other countries such as Japan, South Korea and Germany subsidize their shipyards with nearly 200 times that amount--approximately $8 billion annually. Instead of asking the other countries to stop their subsidies now, this agreement slashes the title 11 loan guarantees by 7\\1/2\\ percent. Meanwhile, several countries are using loopholes to continue using government subsidies to modernize their shipyards. Although these subsidies will end in 1999, Mr. Speaker, I worry that 1999 will be too late. By that time, our European competitors will have used these subsidy loopholes to modernize their shipyards. The level playing field envisioned by the creators of this agreement will have evaporated because American shipyards won't be able to compete with these fully modern yards. If we aren't going to give our shipbuilders loan guarantees, Mr. Speaker, then we shouldn't sign an agreement that leaves open loopholes through which other countries can subsidize their shipbuilding. Hard working Americans in places like the Quincy Shipyard deserve their chance to compete in today's global economy--without having to worry about competing against subsidized foreign shipbuilders. I urge my colleagues to support this rule because it allows both sides a chance to offer their proposals. I also urge my colleagues to support the Bateman amendment to help even the playing field for American shipbuilders. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.","word.count":217,"sep11":-6.62359550561798,"years":1995.23595505618,"days":84,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.181953467444756,"Topic 2":0.201961046752117,"Topic 3":0.0339918945669059,"Topic 4":0.0289498136690601,"Topic 5":0.509414129138089,"Topic 6":0.00901335387379113,"Topic 7":0.00454539388405857,"Topic 8":0.0139996065793579,"Topic 9":0.00536397952107357,"Topic 10":0.01080731457079},{"id":"10720020033103","body":"Hillary Clinton: Mr. President, I rise today in support of an amendment to the important election bill that is being considered. I note that the Presiding Officer has been deeply involved in the crafting of this legislation, along with Senator Dodd, Senator McConnell, and others. It does put us in a very good position to be able to tell Americans that we have heard their concerns about our electoral system and we are moving to address them. I applaud the President for putting $1.2 billion in his budget to be able to fund the requirements that will fall upon the States as they attempt to bring their electoral system in line with what is really required for a modern Federal election system to function. I have introduced this amendment, referred to as the residual vote error rates amendment, a rather complicated description that I will get to in a minute, because I think it is imperative that we address what were the legitimate concerns not only in this last Presidential election, but in elections prior to it, because year after year, not just in the year 2000, ballots have not been counted because of what are referred to as ``residual votes.'' These are overvotes and undervotes, and spoiled votes. According to the definitive Caltech/MIT report: The percentage of discarded ballots is even higher in Senate elections--approximately 5 percent. In other words, almost 5 million votes are not recorded for other prominent statewide offices. Now, in the vast majority of these cases, voters actually believed they were recording their votes, even though their ballots were ultimately discarded. Because of this pattern of discarded votes, so-called residual votes, based on unintentional human error, the Ford-Carter commission, chaired by former President Gerald Ford and former President Jimmy Carter, recommended unanimously that Congress focus not just on machine errors in improving our election system but on the unintentional human errors that make up the bulk of what denies our citizens their vote from being counted. The commission, acting unanimously--Republicans, Democrats, independents, academics, people with political experience, all walks of life--made this unanimous recommendation because they concluded that only by measuring the rate of residual vote errors will we be able to assess effectively whether the voting process as a whole is giving citizens an equal opportunity to have their votes counted. That is why I have offered this amendment, which would require the Office of Election Administration--which is called for in the underlying bill--to set a residual vote error rate standard, or benchmark. In other words, just as we are asking the Office of Election Administration to set a standard for mechanical errors--you know, you pull the lever, put the punch card in a machine, and something goes wrong, and the machine, because of mechanical error, doesn't count your vote--in the bill we are asking the Office of Election Administration to set a benchmark, so that we will make sure that mechanical errors are corrected. Well, similarly, I am asking in this amendment that we set such a standard or benchmark for the residual errors, votes that are never counted, so that we keep those votes to the barest possible minimum. This proposed standard is 100 percent in keeping with the other voting standards in the bill, including the voting system standard that requires the Office of Election Administration to make sure that we have a system nationwide that, in Federal elections, ensures that mechanical errors for people in one State are counted in the same way as for people in another State. Similarly, these unintentional human errors should be held to the same standard. Now, a mechanical error rate standard, I agree, will certainly be helpful in improving the election system; but, unfortunately, it does not address the most significant cause of discarded votes. Just think back to those weeks, those torturous weeks when we had to go through the recounting of votes to try to determine what was the voter's intent. Most States have such a standard in State law, and the States use their systems to determine the outcome once a challenge is made and then to figure out how they are going to appropriately address it by counting those votes and trying to meet the standard that the State sets. We need a similar standard for Federal elections. This amendment will provide greater assurance that all voters in any Federal election are protected. Some people have said in discussing this amendment with me that this may result in suits being brought against States. As I understand the bill, it gives the Attorney General the authority to bring a civil action against States that fail to comply with any standard. This amendment is no different. It does not put an additional burden on the States, nor does it put an additional burden on the Attorney General. In any event, States will have more funding and more than 7 years to comply since jurisdictions that receive grant funds to meet voting system standard requirements will be deemed in compliance until the year 2010. We are not asking any different process than what has already been established in the bill for the mechanical error rate. I also think it is important to recognize that this amendment does not address what happened solely in the Presidential election of 2000. In fact, on the contrary, both the Caltech-MIT report and the Ford- Carter commission have told us that we discovered a problem that has been, unfortunately, widespread throughout our country for many elections. That is why this amendment is supported by the AARP, the League of Women Voters, the NAACP, the National Council of La Raza, the AFL-CIO, the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, and many other groups that are concerned that if we leave this particular issue unaddressed, we have not given our citizens the assurance they deserve that their votes will count. In closing, I hope we are able to obtain the support needed for this residual vote error amendment so that we can be sure we are not only taking care of the machines that break down, but we are taking care of those unintentional errors that may cause a breakdown in the individual citizen being able to have his or her vote counted. I hope for the sake of all Americans we will ensure that we can have the utmost faith in our election system, and I hope my colleagues will support this amendment. I thank the Chair.","word.count":1081,"sep11":0.471910112359551,"years":2002.33146067416,"days":2610,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.246120887945534,"Topic 2":0.0175650069949044,"Topic 3":0.0141816454197918,"Topic 4":0.0137767163620205,"Topic 5":0.00920884191163307,"Topic 6":0.398759818853347,"Topic 7":0.00528862445128777,"Topic 8":0.280301935116818,"Topic 9":0.00913408470705664,"Topic 10":0.00566243823760735},{"id":"10820040001431","body":"Michael Michaud: Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today in total disbelief.

As many of you know, we recently lost several service members as a result of a despicable terrorist act in Yemen. Those sailors, our service members, gave their lives . . . made the ultimate sacrifice for their country. Unfortunately, as we get caught up in our day-to-day lives we often forget that there are men and women in distant lands and dangerous situations doing a lot of heavy lifting for us and this country. Its important that we pause occasionally and remember that our freedom, our wealth and our peace of mind is the direct result of service members such as the sailors on the USS Cole. This year, there has been considerable debate and discussion about keeping promises to our veterans and their families. I think that these bills help to put an end to any doubt about our commitment to our veterans. In my district of El Paso, Texas, I represent almost seventy thousand veterans and family members. I've seen some of the procedural difficulties that veterans and their family members must endure. And, I can talk to you in great detail about how these bills will help to improve the quality of life for our veterans. In my view, this legislation is not about keeping promises or mending fences. I think of it simply as an imperative for the nation. This is legislation that this body must pass because it is the right thing to do for those who have committed so much of themselves to our country.

I would like to ask the Senator from Colorado if he noted also on page 27 that they put a number on what that adjustment would have to be. Their number, as I read it, is .65 percentage adjustment in payroll rates for employees and employers, which translates into $387 billion of adjustment which must occur over a 7-year period. This is the trustees speaking, saying an adjustment must occur over a 7-year period in order to get actuarial solvency, under their intermediate assumptions--which you say are rather rosy--for a 25-year period, which they consider to be a short time. They would rather it be for 75 years.

This morning we held a hearing in the Committee on Science to examine just how the Federal Government can help ensure that our Nation's fire departments are adequately equipped and staffed to perform the jobs they have been asked to do. The hearing shed light on the challenges facing our fire departments. I would like to talk about a couple of those challenges. First, the need of the firefighting community to work together on these efforts. Our challenge and our goal is to increase support for firefighters in this country. After 9/11 of last year, I think all of America recognized that we depend a great deal on our first responders. The firefighters in New York set an example for people all over the world that it takes cooperation if we are going to protect the liberty and freedom that we have. One concern I have is the contest that has been developing between volunteers and full-time firefighters. I think we need to do everything we can so all of our first responders, firefighters and medics work together to accomplish the goals that we need to accomplish at the Federal level. In my home State of Michigan, the Professional Firefighters Union has been pressuring their members not to volunteer in their home communities because they might displace potential union members. The events of September 11 generated a renewed appreciation and respect for firefighters. Two years ago, Members of the House started a program of helping fire departments around the country with equipment and with training. I think we should remind ourselves that many of these first responders are in small communities that cannot depend on a fire department that is 100 miles away. The only way a lot of these communities can survive is to have volunteers that can work in those departments. Where else do we have volunteers that are willing to go out and risk their lives to protect our property and our lives? The grant program that we established provided direct support to fire departments around the country for basic firefighting needs. In its initial year, the program proved to be very popular with both fire services and Members of Congress. Additionally, the U.S. Fire Administration received extensive praise for an exceptional job of developing and implementing the program efficiently under challenging time constraints. In my mind, the need-based peer-reviewed grant program is an excellent example of how the Federal Government can assist the first responders, both paid full-time people and volunteers, with the basic training and equipment they need to answer our calls. If we lose volunteers in those very small communities, it will be a tremendous financial burden to maintain the kind of protection that we have now. This has got to be a situation where we work together. Those of us in the Fire Caucus, while supportive of a grant program to increase terrorism preparedness, quickly recognized that the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program was intended to provide fundamental firefighting support to departments, and should be kept separate and distinct from the FEMA counterterrorism funds that the President proposed. Further complicating this problem has been language in the proposed Homeland Security legislation that gives the FEMA Administrator and the Secretary of the new department authority to shift funds among programs. There is a real concern now that this authority, while understandable for administrative flexibility, could eliminate the basic program that several of us thought was very important that we implement in this country. In conclusion, let me say that firefighters around this country are there when there is a community project. In many places they hold baked good sales to make sure that they can buy the equipment to protect us in those local communities. We need local support for these firefighters, we need more State support for these firefighters, and we need more Federal support for these firefighters. Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend the United States Fire Administration that my science research subcommittee oversees for their hard work and commitment in bringing the goals of this program to fruition. Administrator David Paulison and grants director Bryan Cowan have gone above and beyond the call of duty.","word.count":739,"sep11":1.08426966292135,"years":2002.94382022472,"days":2828,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0222568909916486,"Topic 2":0.0103427535522294,"Topic 3":0.0089889371051915,"Topic 4":0.131182297888119,"Topic 5":0.00158517746846871,"Topic 6":0.0598132342570571,"Topic 7":0.109251289518572,"Topic 8":0.102976100962759,"Topic 9":0.549988832801527,"Topic 10":0.00361448545442739},{"id":"10820030084103","body":"Orrin Hatch: Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Oklahoma. I express my gratitude to the Democrats and, of course, our two leaders on the committee for being willing to vitiate this cloture vote and end what some perceived was a threatened filibuster of Governor Leavitt. I am very appreciative that they will allow a vote up or down tomorrow morning on Governor Leavitt's nomination as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. That is what should be done. Governor Leavitt is one of the finest public servants in this country. He has served our State long and well, but he has served the whole country in a variety of ways which I will mention. It goes without saying that this is not a job Governor Leavitt has asked for or aspired to. But he has accepted the President's nomination, first of all because the President has asked him to, and second, because it's a job of critical importance for our Nation. Other than our people and our values, our Nation's environment and natural resources are our greatest asset. We in Utah understand that better than most. And in spite of what some critics of President Bush would have us believe, our Nation has been steadily getting cleaner and safer every year of his presidency. Already, President Bush has signed the Persistent Organic Pollutants Treaty. He has proposed and begun implementing ground breaking legislation to greatly accelerate the clean up of our Nation's brownfield sites. He has announced his plan to reduce off-road diesel emissions by 90 percent. Although his critics refuse to believe it, President Bush's Clear Skies initiative will, in fact, lead to quicker reductions in air pollution across the board than would otherwise be accomplished. Under President Bush, powerplants will be updated and become cleaner than ever before. Under President Bush our forests and other natural resources will become better managed, and the threat of forest fires will be reduced--something that has not been done in the past. Most important, our President is accomplishing these environmental goals without a dramatic increase in Federal mandates. He is doing it without pitting the environment against human needs. He is doing it without pinning the ``polluter'' label on our industry, as the past administration was so apt to do. President Bush has shifted the environmental debate from one about process and control to one about outcomes and results. Governor Leavitt has a similar record for improving the environment in Utah. Before Governor Leavitt came to office, Utah often failed to meet national clean air standards. In large part this was because most Utahns live on a valley floor surrounded by mountains. Through hard work and consensus building, though, Governor Leavitt helped Utah to overcome our air quality obstacles, and our State now is in consistent compliance with the EPA's air quality standards. Governor Leavitt also has been a leader in finding solutions to regional air problems. He helped to begin the Grand Canyon Visibility Transport Commission and the Western Regional Air Partnership, which established a wide sweeping collaborative approach to reducing haze over our national parks and public lands on the Colorado Plateau. When Governor Leavitt took office, about 60 percent of Utah's streams met Federal water quality standards. This represented the current national average for States. Under his leadership, though, 73 percent of Utah's streams now meet the Federal standards, which is well above the national average. With his oversight, Utah developed a collaborative approach to meeting the Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations regulations. His approach was so successful that the U.S. Department of Agriculture has adopted it as a model. Governor Leavitt has also led initiatives in our State to preserve our open space, improve fisheries, upgrade sewer systems, and clean up 5,000 underground gas storage tanks, thus preventing their contamination of Utah's water supply. Thanks to Governor Leavitt's careful stewardship, Utah's natural resources have not only survived a period of intense economic and population growth but have been improved across the board. Is it any wonder that President Bush looks to Governor Leavitt to lead the charge on this very important front, when the Governor has so successfully pursued a collaborative approach to improving the environment? To anyone who questions Michael Leavitt's commitment, I say: Look at the record; it speaks for itself. We can also look at Utah's budget during his administration. In his 10 years as Governor, Mike Leavitt won a 41 percent increase in spending on environmental protection, and that's after adjusting for inflation. According to the Environmental Council of States, the average per capita spending on the environment is $51.80. Under Michael Leavitt, however, Utah surpassed that average, spending $62.31 per capita on the environment. The average State spends about 1.4 percent of its budget on the environment. Under Governor Leavitt's leadership, Utah now spends 2 percent of its budget on the environment. The record proves that Governor Leavitt is a champion of the environment. But the record also informs us that he is one of the finest public managers in the Nation. The Governor has worked tirelessly for our State. Yet, he has found the time to serve as the chair of the Council of State Governors, the Republican Governors' Association, the Western Governors' Association, and the National Governors' Association. You don't get there without being one of the best, if not the best. In 5 of Mike Leavitt's 10 years as Utah's chief executive, our State has been ranked the best managed State. USA Today recently called Utah the best fiscally managed State in the country. Even after the extremely tough financial times faced by our States in recent years, under Governor Leavitt, Utah has maintained its Triple A bond rating. How could President Bush have found a better candidate to head up the Environmental Protection Agency? The answer is he couldn't have. And how does holding up Michael Leavitt's nomination help our environment or our nation? We finally concluded it doesn't. The obvious answer is: it doesn't. Clearly, confirming this nominee is in the best interest of our environment and our Nation. Finally, let me just say that I have known Mike Leavitt and his wonderful wife Jackie for nearly 30 years. No one I know works harder, is more fair and honest, is more capable, and is more sincere than my good friend, the Governor of Utah. I urge my colleagues to join me in confirming Michael Leavitt to fill one of the most important jobs in government, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. I thank all of those who are making this possible with an up-or-down vote tomorrow morning.","word.count":1098,"sep11":2.17977528089888,"years":2004.0393258427,"days":3218,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.221092431873551,"Topic 2":0.31482016784728,"Topic 3":0.00908746956540984,"Topic 4":0.21577482771138,"Topic 5":0.00581964375317905,"Topic 6":0.00688506359534505,"Topic 7":0.151519129306217,"Topic 8":0.0211649898272714,"Topic 9":0.0499911497760709,"Topic 10":0.00384512674429588},{"id":"10419960083238","body":"Hank Brown: Madam President, my distinguished friend from Rhode Island has summarized the case well, and, as is always the case, he is a very accurate describer of events and facts.

Madam President, I want to indicate that I think he is right that both Democratic and Republican administrations in the past have supported the agreement. I indicate that he is right. I think both the large corporations and the unions--at least it is my information-- support the agreement. But, Madam President, I want to invite the Members' attention to what happens if this agreement is not ratified, the specter that the distinguished Senator has raised. What happens? If the agreement is not ratified, $78 million goes back in the Treasury that would be used to prop up prices of natural rubber. In other words, the taxpayers of this country get a $78 million break. Second, if this agreement is not ratified, we will have lower prices for rubber than we would if the agreement is ratified. Third, if the agreement is not ratified, we will have greater competition in the marketplace. Finally, I think if the agreement is not ratified, we will have set an example that this country is serious about competition and its antitrust laws, and we will have renewed a commitment to our consumers. My sense is that returning money to the Treasury, lower prices for consumers, increased competition in the marketplace are good things, and that saying no to the special interests is appropriate as well. So at least in this Senator's judgment, we have a responsibility to vote against the treaty.

Mr. Chairman, as I indicated, I do not plan to oppose the Conyers amendment, but I do have, as the gentleman knows, serious reservations about some of the features in this amendment. I feel the gentleman has worked diligently with my team in the subcommittee to work out some of the problems that they perceived. Others we may need to address down the road in the conference. First of all, the Republican side of the aisle, our side, has a record on domestic violence and the 1994 Crime Bill's Violence Against Women Act that I think is abundantly clear. We have been highly supportive of many programs that have become crucial resources to battered and abused women throughout the country. By the end of this year, the Republican Congress will have spent nearly $1 billion over four years on the Violence Against Women Program. The Conyers amendment focuses almost entirely on domestic violence and elder abuse, but contains no provisions pertaining specifically to sexual crimes against children, which is the heart of the underlying bill. While domestic violence and elder abuse are very important issues, to which Congress has responded in numerous ways over the fast fiscal years, H.R. 3494 is focused specifically on sex crimes against children. Subtitle A of the amendment provides for reauthorization of a 1994 Violence Against Women Act program which provides grants to states for law enforcement and prosecution to combat violence against women. While we support the goals of the grant program and the strong enforcement of the domestic violence laws, the need to reauthorize the program is not imminent. It does not expire until the year 2000. We may want to examine the currently existing program to see if it could be improved upon between now and then. Title 8 will reduce states' Federal crime fighting funds in the Byrne Grant Program if they fail to enforce protection orders issued by other states, as is currently required by Federal law. While I certainly support the goals of the proposal, I am generally opposed to provisions which further reduce Byrne Grant penalties for failing to do something required by Congress. Title 181 allows victims of Federal domestic violence to enter into the Federal Witness Protection Program. This program originally was established for witnesses for organized crime prosecutions. No assessment has been made as to the cost and the ability of the program to incorporate this influx of women or families entering into the program. While I have these concerns that I have expressed about the amendment, as I said earlier, the gentleman from Michigan has been very accommodating when we worked with his staff to bring the amendment to the floor, and, consequently, I will support the amendment in the form it is in today, with the understanding we can work out some of these concerns further in conference, and I believe the gentleman is agreeable to that.

The House even went on record and instructed conferees to retain the policy in conference. So it was a very real and legitimate part of the House/Senate conference that occurred. The flip side of it is that, on the issue of arrearages, that measure did not pass here but passed on the Senate, but we acceded to the Senate to move that ball forward. Let me also make a point, when Members suggest that my friends on the other side of the aisle were locked out of the price, let me just note that I chaired the subcommittee that wrote the major product that emerged as the State Department authorization bill. We had five hearings that preceded the markup of the bill that is now before us. My good friend, the gentleman from California , and the Democrats were absolutely free to ask any question, to be part of that process, as they so engaged themselves. We had a markup in subcommittee. Twenty one amendments were offered. That markup went very well and the bill passed onto the full committee. We went to the full committee. During several days of markup we considered 22 amendments to the State portion of the bill. The bill came over to the floor. We spent 4 days on the floor of the House of Representatives. Members who wanted to offer amendments on the other side of the aisle were free to do so provided they were germane. A total of 34 amendments were offered, fully debated, recorded votes occurred. We then went to conference. On issue after issue, our staffs, as well as Members, met, talked about language and sections of the bill. There were some things that we came to an impasse on. The major issue upon which deadlocked the conference was the Mexico City policy. This House instructed the conferees to stay with that the pro-life position. We did so on the State Department bill as well. So this is a clear manifestation of House sentiment. That is part of this bill. I would argue that this has been a give-and-take. We have provided a compromise Mexico City policy. We also provide the arrearages, which is an anathema to many Members of this side of the aisle, and many on that side of the aisle as well, but there are some reform provisions that make it very meaningful. So there is give-and-take in the legislative process. The President regrettably or some on the other side want it to be all give from us and all take by them. That's unacceptable.

This extraordinary scientific achievement awakened widespread concern about the possibility of a brave new world, where human beings would be cloned and where individuals would seek to achieve a kind of immortality by reproducing themselves. There is widespread agreement among scientists, ethicists, and ordinary Americans that production of human beings by cloning should be prohibited, at least until the possibilities and pitfalls of this scientific procedure are better understood. The President reacted rapidly to this scientific advance and the unprecedented issues it raised by asking the National Bioethics Advisory Commission to study the issue and make recommendations. The Commission recommended that creation of human beings by cloning should be banned for several years, and the Administration has submitted legislation to implement this recommendation. The legislation that Senator Feinstein and I are introducing today will assure the American public that reproducing human beings by cloning will be prohibited. It largely follows the President's legislation and the Recommendations of the Commission. It makes it illegal to produce human beings by cloning and establishes strict penalties for those who try to do so. In addition, it prohibits anyone from beginning the cloning process in this country and carrying out the implantation step in another country. But just as important as what the bill does is what it does not do. It does not seek to use public concern about cloning to establish a back door ban on research into human development. A prohibition that goes too far could outlaw needed research on the prevention, treatment, and cure of cancer. It could outlaw needed research on fertility, to help birth defects, and hereditary diseases. It could outlaw needed research on the cure of spinal cord injuries. All of these various kinds of research have broad support in Congress and the country. Yet a blunderbuss ban on human development research could easily interfere with this important and life-saving research, or even halt it altogether. In addition, the FDA has jurisdiction over human cloning and will act vigorously to shut down any clinic that operates without FDA approval. The FDA must find that human cloning is safe and effective. Given the current state of the science, the DFA would almost certainly decide that a human cloning procedure is not safe at the current time. The FDA approval process is not a permanent ban on human cloning, but it effectively bans the procedures for the near future. The American Medical Association and over forty national medical organizations and research groups have voiced support for the kind of research that is urgently needed to continue the progress we are making against a wide range of diseases. Benjamin Younger, the Executive Director of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, has said, ``We must work together to ensure that in our effort to make human cloning illegal we do not sentence millions of people to needless suffering because research and progress into their illness cannot proceed.'' The legislation we are introducing today will do what the American people want--ban the production of human beings by cloning. It strikes the proper balance between assuring that human beings will not be reproduced through cloning and allowing needed research to continue. I hope that Congress will act promptly to enact this legislation.","word.count":550,"sep11":-4.75842696629214,"years":1997.10112359551,"days":748,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.019490580829267,"Topic 2":0.421582929072067,"Topic 3":0.210604252862134,"Topic 4":0.0584592084996205,"Topic 5":0.0493863752479894,"Topic 6":0.117689417213326,"Topic 7":0.0100682039741886,"Topic 8":0.0632469610107102,"Topic 9":0.0389777999504302,"Topic 10":0.0104942713402668},{"id":"10519970067576","body":"Byron Dorgan: Mr. President, if there is no further business to come before the Senate, I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in adjournment under the previous order.

In these challenging times, consumers should not have to have a Ph.D. in finance to quickly and easily get in touch with the appropriate State and Federal banking regulators.

One of the most abundant sources of energy in the Upper Great Plains region is wind. My State of North Dakota ranks first in wind power production potential, and the Department of Energy has said that North Dakota alone could capture enough wind energy to supply 36 percent of the power needs of the lower 48 States. Not only does wind offer a clean and inexpensive form of energy, it also could provide our rural residents with an important source of income. DOE estimates that a 1,000-acre farm could earn as much as $80,000 per year in wind royalties. One wind energy initiative of particular interest to me is being conducted on the Turtle Mountain Chippewa Reservation by the Center for New Growth and Economic Development at the Turtle Mountain Community College.

When I first wrote the Director of the FBI, I had no idea who put this in there. I just wanted to get to the bottom of it because I was so outraged at the tactic. What I think we ought to be doing is getting the special counsel because the special counsel is the way to certainly remove any appearance of a conflict, and perhaps a conflict itself. Attorney General Ashcroft, whom you quoted, is known as a close political ally of the President's. There is an argument that the Attorney General should be removed from the President and be a lawyer for the Nation. And there is an argument that the Attorney General should be a close political ally of the President. Democrats and Republicans--it has not been a Democratic or Republican issue. John Kennedy appointed his brother as Attorney General. But when you appoint an Attorney General who is a close political ally and friend, and when something sensitive with conflicts of interest occurs, then you have an obligation, in my judgment, to move for a special prosecutor. You pay a price, in a certain sense. You gain things by having a political ally as Attorney General, but you also lose things, and you lose the guise of independence, the actuality of independence. My colleague is so right. The best thing that could happen is we pass this resolution unanimously, we all work together to get a respected independent counsel--someone like a John Danforth or a Warren Rudman or a Sam Nunn or a George Mitchell--and then they go forward with their investigation. I think every one of us on this side of the aisle, as well as the other, would be content that the chips will fall where they may so this dastardly crime, and that is what it is, will be exposed. This idea of not bringing up such a resolution, of not wanting to debate it, of, again, maybe casting aspersions on the motivation of those who are for it--we have 14 or 15 of us, and we will have more--is going to make the American people think: Wait a minute, maybe they are worried; maybe there is something to hide--which there may or may not be.

This amendment, which was first offered by Senator Craig on September 10 in the Senate version of the bill, would prohibit any U.S. funds from being used ``for cooperation with, or assistance or other support to, the International Criminal Court or the Preparatory Commission.'' The Craig amendment, which was opposed by the administration, seeks to prevent our government from having a role in shaping the definition of the crime of aggression and other key issues pertaining to the International Criminal Court, ICC. It is my belief that this attempt to curtail the power of the President to negotiate treaties is unconstitutional and I urge the administration to remain engaged in a process vital to our country's national security. In addition to highlighting the constitutional concerns raised by this amendment, I would also like this opportunity to raise a broader concern. The legislative maneuvering that led to the adoption of this amendment follows European Union and German requests that our government refrain from adopting anti-ICC legislation. In late October the Belgium Foreign Minister Louis Michel wrote on behalf of the European Union to Senator Daschle and Secretary of State Colin Powell, expressing the EU's strong support for the ICC. German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer wrote to the Secretary of State directly on October 31, noting that, ``In view of the international effort against terrorism . . . it is particularly important for the United States and the European Union to act in accord in this field too.'' He continued, ``The future International Criminal Court will be a valuable instrument for combating the most serious crimes. It will provide us with an opportunity to fight with judicial means crimes such as the mass murder perpetrated by terrorists in New York and Washington on 11 September 2001.'' While Members of the Senate may have real questions and concerns pertaining to the ICC, now is not the time to be pushing legislation that undercuts the administration's efforts to work with our closest allies in building a strong coalition against terrorism. In addition, the President's recent order allowing military tribunals to be created for trials involving members of al Qaeda suggests that a long-term fight against terrorism will include a variety of legal structures ranging from Lockerbie type tribunals to the International Criminal Court. It is thus imperative that our government remains engaged in the development of the ICC. I strongly hope that the Bush administration will do that.","word.count":440,"sep11":0.182584269662921,"years":2002.04213483146,"days":2507,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0698625900807452,"Topic 2":0.160661802808504,"Topic 3":0.00523433798330394,"Topic 4":0.455662147101368,"Topic 5":0.00743014764814036,"Topic 6":0.00221283467809156,"Topic 7":0.00735342955528415,"Topic 8":0.0472046741419131,"Topic 9":0.0909086057514967,"Topic 10":0.153469430251153},{"id":"10419960080892","body":"Claiborne Pell: Mr. President, last week the Senate passed the so-called Defense of Marriage Act.

Second, it is clear to me that this legislation is politically motivated. By making this unnecessary bill a priority of this Congress, while failing to act on numerous other measures of much more immediate importance, the Republican leadership has made clear its desire to try to embarrass those who have traditionally supported equal rights for all Americans, including gays and lesbians. Third, I do not believe that most Rhode Islanders or most Americans think that this a matter of urgent national importance requiring congressional action. Prior to the introduction of this legislation, I had not received one letter or phone call expressing concern about gay or lesbian marriages. And since the introduction of this legislation, I have received only limited correspondence from Rhode Islanders expressing support for it.

Mr. President, I know that people of good will and strong faith can differ on this sensitive subject. And I knew that the Senate's vote would be a lopsided one. But if we truly believe in family values, we should remember that the gay men and lesbians whom this legislation will affect are our sons and daughters, our sisters and brothers, our friends and colleagues. Before we enact legislation that further isolates them from the mainstream of society, we should consider carefully whether this legislation is needed, desired, or desirable.

Although Congress has been supporting the growth of charter schools for almost 10 years now, we should remember that this is, in fact, a grassroots movement. The movement was really started in the early 1990s by concerned parents and frustrated teachers who were fed up with the status quo, weary of fighting the bureaucracy that defeats innovation, and tired of seeing their children consigned to mediocrity and to failure. In my State of Wisconsin, I am proud to say that we have a strong charter school program that was one of the first in the Nation to be established. I recently participated in the charter school conference held near my district. I was excited to learn of the innovation going on in my State. For example, Wisconsin will soon have two virtual charter schools, which are public charter schools that conduct classes online. Thanks to Wisconsin's open enrollment law, children from anywhere in the State can apply to enroll in these schools. These virtual charter schools will provide a computer and Internet access to the enrolled children. In these virtual schools, the parents have great control, and the parents make final decisions as to their child's personalized learning plan while still having full access to professionally-prepared curriculum and teacher support. Thus, this approach utilizes the advantages of home schooling, charters, and public school choice to create a unique educational experience. I would like to thank my colleague, the gentleman from Florida for bringing forward this resolution. I appreciate the opportunity to speak in its support, and I urge my colleagues to support a National Charter Schools Week, and to continue to encourage the growth of this important and successful reform movement.","word.count":309,"sep11":0.648876404494382,"years":2002.50842696629,"days":2673,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.854901915543068,"Topic 2":0.0505810498077898,"Topic 3":0.00994401702330274,"Topic 4":0.0233678689343686,"Topic 5":0.0104626879195712,"Topic 6":0.0101512303739248,"Topic 7":0.00820325027376509,"Topic 8":0.0172309492340984,"Topic 9":0.0107074974169159,"Topic 10":0.00444953347319535},{"id":"10519970016266","body":"Owen Pickett: Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.

I thank the gentlewoman from New York for yielding me this time. Mr. Speaker, I think it will provide a fair and open debate on the Conservation and Reinvestment Act, H.R. 701, that is before us today. This legislation is really about redeeming a promise that the Congress of the United States made to the American people 36 years ago. We said as a trade-off for drilling offshore, for some of the environmental damage that occurred from time to time, we would take a portion of those royalties that this Nation receives from the offshore oil that belongs to all of the people of this Nation and we would reinvest them in America's irreplaceable resources. That would be the trade-off. We did that and we started to do that, and then little by little, little by little Congress started dipping into the fund. They started dipping into the fund for other reasons for whatever it was, just as they were dipping into the Social Security Fund, just as they were dipping into the Highway Trust Fund. This is now about redeeming that fund and saying let us go back, not by raising taxes, but by recapturing that money that comes in year after year from offshore oil and use a portion of it to protect and conserve America's resources. That is why we have this kind of list of sponsors and cosponsors. Thousands of organizations from all across the country who support this legislation. Some will call them special interests, but if we read the list we will see our governors, our mayors. We will see our next door neighbors. We will see the soccer moms of the Soccer Federation. We will see the Pop Warner coaches and the people who play Pop Warner Football. We will see the Campfire Girls and the Boy Scouts; people who go out and recreate, who understand the pressure of the resources are under in this Nation. This is about our communities. This legislation is about building an environmental infrastructure so people can enjoy a quality of life as our country continues to grow, the pressures of suburbia, the pressures of new housing developments, the pressure of new growth and formation of families so that they can have bike trails and hiking trails, so they can explore the water fronts in our bays and rivers and on the oceans of this country. We know the backlog. We know the lost opportunities. This is about making sure that we do not lose those opportunities in the future. But we also make very sure that local communities are involved in these decisions, because they will have to match the money that is put up. And we also make very sure that we as elected representatives are involved in this decision, because this is designed so we do not have land acquisitions put in bills in the middle of the night that we do not know anything about and then just are sprung on the public. Because of the insistence of the gentleman from California and others, there is notifications in here. There is a recommitment recognizing what a taking meanings and the implications of that and that they have to have the approval of the Congress. They cannot do those things that are not authorized by the Congress of the United States. Mr. Speaker, this is a balanced bill. It is an important bill. I think we have to understand that this is about making the Federal Government a better partner, and a reliable partner. We were supposed to be funding land and water conservation all of these years for our local communities. They have lost out on hundreds of millions and billions of dollars because one day we just stopped funding it, and took the money and did something else with it. That is not the promise we made to the people of this country. So I would hope as we listen to the debate, we will have many amendments that my colleagues will understand the kind of legislation that CARA represents, its bipartisan nature. It has the support of 50 governors, the support of local government that we say we want involved in these organizations, and then thousands of citizen organizations that every year put up their own money and put up their own effort to clean up the beaches, to clean up the rivers, to build trails, to build ball fields, to provide recreational opportunity. This is to help them continue to do that. That is why the Police Athletic League supports it. That is why the Boys Clubs and Girls Clubs, the sporting goods manufacturers, many other business organizations support this effort. They recognize this is about our communities. This is about the quality of life for our families, so we will have a place to take our son or daughter fishing, so we have a place to take our son or daughter hunting, so those places will be preserved and also the habitat will be preserved so that we can continue to do that in perpetuity. Mr. Speaker, that is why organizations like BASS, the biggest organization of bass fishermen throughout this country, supports this effort, or Ducks Unlimited, because they know what it means if we can restore habitat, if we can provide good waterways, if we can provide refuges, that is the kind of organizations that are here surrounding this bill. I would hope that all of our Members, all 316 people and more who are cosponsoring this bill, would recognize the kind of commitment. Because we know from data taken from polling of the American people, some 80 percent, over 80 percent of the people believe that America should be making these long-term investments in our physical heritage in the great environmental assets of this Nation.","word.count":988,"sep11":-1.37359550561798,"years":2000.48595505618,"days":1953,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0846232334130059,"Topic 2":0.0569514763275525,"Topic 3":0.00890257320132537,"Topic 4":0.0630703633466919,"Topic 5":0.00616738816980245,"Topic 6":0.00632185972788989,"Topic 7":0.00810453940845733,"Topic 8":0.154954938895326,"Topic 9":0.589455326390315,"Topic 10":0.0214483011196343},{"id":"10820040029525","body":"Charles Rangel: Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr. Chairman, I think that in view of the victory that the gentlewoman from California has had, that maybe, just maybe, there is a breath of fresh air entering the House where we can say, let us stop this punitive approach to Cuba and the Cuban government, and let us start a common sense approach. The gentleman from Florida makes it appear as though we are rewarding a dictator for not upholding the principles of democracy. None of us here want to do that. Some would say that we have a disregard for the loss of life or the imprisonment of people unfairly, as we all agree is wrong and immoral and indecent, but that is not so. We are not talking about rewarding; we are talking about normalization. We are talking about the United States of America's principles. We are talking about Americans who feel so proud of what we believe in that we do not let any nickel-and-dime dictator prevent us from taking our message to the people, the people in Cuba. For 40 years, we have taken this nonsensical approach that we are going to punish the Cuban people, deny them access to our markets, deny them financial assistance, notwithstanding the pain and cruel treatment that nature has given to them through hurricanes, notwithstanding the poverty in the country, and we have had this belief on our side, at least some of us on both sides, that the American approach, if properly presented to the people, will prevail; not guns, not bombs and not penalties, but the American way. We believe that trading with people is a way for our business people to be ambassadors of the free market system. As the gentlewoman from California said, we believe our kids are better than any ambassadors that come out of the State Department when they talk about life in the United States. We believe our farmers and our business people, they really know how to talk to these people about doing the right thing. But if what we are saying is that we are afraid of Castro and we are afraid of communism, then I suggest to my colleagues that we ought to get the heck out of China. We ought to get out of Vietnam. We ought to restore sanctions against Libya, and for God's sake, if we are looking for a democracy, we have a long march in Pakistan to find it. We believe we are powerful enough that we are on the right side of the issue, and for those who are afraid of the truth, then jam their stations, jam their TV, have no communications with these people and just say that we will prevail, because we are powerful enough to bring not Castro down to his knees but the people who are relying on a little assistance from their friends in the United States. I do not think you have to be Cuban-American, I do not think you have to represent Cuban-Americans to understand what compassion is. But I will tell my colleagues one thing, I would hate to represent a district that had families in Cuba, after this horrific hurricane where people are in real pain economically and socially, and I wanted to send them some money, I wanted to visit, I wanted to see who got hurt, I may have wanted to go to a funeral, but I have to say that my heart, my compassion, my country, we are with you, but because we hate with such vengeance your president who has survived so many of ours, we will not be able to help. That, I think, is a more difficult position than to say that you are against communism. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.","word.count":640,"sep11":3.10955056179775,"years":2004.9691011236,"days":3549,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.89101623864896,"Topic 2":0.0362176266945216,"Topic 3":0.00778758994884399,"Topic 4":0.0184357720843988,"Topic 5":0.00776332324449747,"Topic 6":0.00816361774601652,"Topic 7":0.00598941245472624,"Topic 8":0.0136387464828344,"Topic 9":0.00764904642465181,"Topic 10":0.00333862627054968},{"id":"10519970030261","body":"Roy Blunt: Without objection, the gentlewoman from Colorado and the gentleman from Kentucky each will control 10 minutes.

Let me begin with a very important point: People in this country, I think, and our friends in the media misunderstand the true and legitimate meaning of partisanship. Partisanship has a very essential role to play in democracy. The Founding Fathers simultaneously launched this Nation, denounced parties, and formed them, because it does seem inevitable when large numbers of people are going to govern themselves that some forms of organization come forward. Partisanship is not only not a bad thing, it's a necessary thing in a self-governing polity. Partisanship becomes a problem if the legitimate differences that define the parties spill over angrily and make it impossible to work on issues where those differences should not exist. I think the Committee on Financial Services, under my predecessor as chairman, Mr. Oxley of Ohio, and I hope under my own chairmanship, have shown that that is not necessary to be the case, that it is possible from time to time to have legitimate strong differences on an ideological or partisan basis without that in any way interfering with our ability to come together on areas where we should agree. This bill, obviously, today is an example of the latter. We have a bill that has been brought forward in a totally bipartisan manner to improve the efficiency with which assistance goes for rural housing. That's the second point I wanted to make. Much of what we do is, in fact, to improve the efficiency with which programs work, and the committee has had a chance to bring several bills to the floor that do that. We will be doing more. The gentleman from New Hampshire mentioned one of the conflicts we are trying to resolve here is between the rules that apply when you were trying to use tax credits for low-income housing and those that apply when you were talking about the programmatic legislation. We do something about that here. Under the leadership of the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means, the gentleman from New York , and the Financial Services Committee, we are working out legislation that will do that kind of reconciliation for all housing programs. And we will shortly have on the floor of this House a bill that will greatly increase the efficiency with which all housing programs can be merged, tax-based ones and appropriations-based ones, increasing the amount of housing we can build at no further increase to the taxpayer. And the third point I would note is that this is rural housing. Too often when people think about Federal housing programs they think only about the urban areas. Urban areas are important, but so are rural areas. And I am very proud that this committee has given equal attention, or let me say appropriate attention, to both. Obviously, the need is often greater in the more heavily populated areas, but we have given fully proportionate attention to the rural areas. So, I am very proud we have a bill today that shows how you can be bipartisan, even while there are legitimate partisan differences, that aims at increasing the efficiency with which Federal funds are spent and which recognizes that people in the rural areas have a need for housing assistance, to some extent, just as do people in the urban areas. I thank the gentleman from New Hampshire for the leadership he has shown. I appreciate the gentlewoman from West Virginia, who has become the ranking member of the Housing Subcommittee and with whom we have very good relationships. And I hope the bill is passed.","word.count":624,"sep11":6.53089887640449,"years":2008.3904494382,"days":4767,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.937329740894528,"Topic 2":0.0269356689217085,"Topic 3":0.00379559978771595,"Topic 4":0.00849579877668948,"Topic 5":0.00509116090661519,"Topic 6":0.00423449805273669,"Topic 7":0.00282021636368714,"Topic 8":0.00625761942663512,"Topic 9":0.00339867539101279,"Topic 10":0.00164102147867176},{"id":"10419960021767","body":"Jim Saxton: Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute I just would like to say to the gentleman from Connecticut that I am kind of surprised hearing his opposition this morning, particularly since the gentleman is from the State of New Jersey and inasmuch as the chairman of the full committee, the gentleman from Alaska [Mr. Young], offered the gentleman an opportunity to take Connecticut out of this bill.

Mr. Speaker, it is my great honor and privilege to rise today in support of Senate 2640, the Guardians of Freedom Memorial Post Office Building Designation Act. The concept of this legislation, while generated and originated in our office on the House side, was the genesis for the bill introduced by my good friend, Senator John Ensign, as companion legislation to my bill, H.R. 4442. All five members of Nevada's congressional delegation fully support the memorial that these bills would realize. This bill honors Nevada's military personnel who have made that ultimate sacrifice during the global war on terror and the liberation of Iraq. Nevada's families have lost precious loved ones during these conflicts, and many members of Nevada's communities have requested help in providing some form of recognition for these noble men and women. This bill helps provide such recognition by establishing the Guardians of Freedom Memorial Post Office building in Reno, Nevada, a consecration of ground forever preserving the memories of these valiant individuals. The name for this special memorial post office originates through a contest in a high school in the North Valleys area of Reno, Nevada, and the name Guardians of Freedom Post Office was selected from a name generated by the Junior ROTC of North Valleys High School in Reno. Those students created a name which best embodies the spirit of our recently fallen heroes. I congratulate these young Nevadans on their achievement and thank them for their participation in this special honor that will forever recognize these fallen patriots. To my knowledge, Mr. Speaker, no other post office in the United States honors the memories of all of those of a community who have fallen in defense of our Nation's liberty. At the Guardians of Freedom Post Office, a plaque will be placed at this site bearing the names of the Nevadans who have made the ultimate sacrifice in fighting terrorism and who have died defending America's liberties. It is my hope that the names permanently etched into this plaque will be an enduring reminder to future generations that freedom is never free, and those who defend liberty will never be forgotten. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill.","word.count":145,"sep11":2.16292134831461,"years":2004.02247191011,"days":3212,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.241759185762402,"Topic 2":0.0307004545837109,"Topic 3":0.15908931436545,"Topic 4":0.0103723979819258,"Topic 5":0.0347796755301287,"Topic 6":0.315743462197686,"Topic 7":0.00489585072684725,"Topic 8":0.182895830342812,"Topic 9":0.0145194983627693,"Topic 10":0.0052443301462684},{"id":"10419960043367","body":"Byron Dorgan: I will offer one additional unanimous-consent request.

I have a nephew that benefits from special education. But this amendment is a Johnny-one-note approach to education, and it ought to be defeated. We will be offering an amendment later on in the process which attempts to add a billion and a half dollars to special education by asking the majority to consider cutting back its tax cuts by about 20 percent in size. That is the best way, in my view, under present circumstances to strengthen special education. This amendment is opposed by the National Association of State Directors of Special Education, it is opposed by the National PTA, it is opposed by the American Association of School Administrators, the National Education Association, and the National Education of Federally Impacted Schools. Why? Because it cuts the maximum Pell grant award for every working-class kid trying to go to college $275 below last year's level. It cuts education for the poorest kids in this country who are having the most trouble getting an education, the disadvantaged, by $116 million. That means 178,000 fewer kids will be served. It cuts the increases in this bill for Even Start literacy services, comprehensive school reform and high school equivalency and college assistance for migrant students. It cuts services to the deaf and blind students at Gallaudet and at the Printing House for the Blind and at the National Technical Institute for the Deaf. It cuts Impact Aid by $78 million. The National Association of State Directors of Special Education says as follows: ``While we support full funding for IDEA and welcome increases in funding that take us toward that goal, we are concerned that these increases are the result of cuts in proposed spending on Federal education programs that also serve the needs of children with disabilities, including title I, 21st century community learning centers, and vocational education. As a result, taking money from one education program and putting it into special education will not increase the total amount of funding available to support children with special needs. These proposed amendments demonstrate the fundamental problem with this appropriations bill. It lacks sufficient funding and support for education programs across the board. This deficiency will not be fixed by moving dollars from one program to another.'' I could not have said it better myself. I would urge rejection of the amendment.

They are worried about retirement and they are worried about their pensions. Are they going to be there? Are they adequately funded? Who will pay for it? The taxpayer?

Unfortunately, H.R. 3125 will actually do nothing to stem the tide of Internet gambling. In fact, the bill constitutes a significant step backwards for several reasons. First, it provides for extended Internet gambling in the areas of horse racing, dog racing, and Jai-Alai. And there seems to be some question about that, so I will just read from the bill, starting on page 34: ``The prohibition in this section does not apply to,'' and when we turn to page 35 it says, ``any otherwise lawful State regulated parimutuel waging activities on live horse or dog racing or live Jai- Alai conducted on a closed-loop subscriber-based system.'' That closed- loop subscriber-based system is about as hard to get on as opening up an Internet brokerage account to trade stocks. About anybody can do it. As a result of these exemptions, the bill will proliferate rather than prohibit gambling over the Internet, and that is because people would rather gamble at home rather than having to go all the way to the track. In addition, the bill will not effectively prohibit those gambling interests it actually seeks to stop because offshore the Federal Government has no authority to close those particular Web sites. We can tell AOL or another company to shut down a domestic site, but we have no authority to shut down something offshore in a rogue nation for which we have no diplomatic relations. That will give them essentially a complete exclusive franchise to run these operations. Lastly, the bill is not effective because it provides no individual liability. While it makes activities by certain gambling entities running the operation illegal, it does not make it illegal for the individual to gamble. For that reason, Mr. Speaker, the title of the bill, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act, is one that I am sure a lot of Americans will support. But this bill will actually expand gambling for horse racing, dog racing, and Jai-Alai. It will be ineffective in stopping casino gambling and sports betting run by offshore businesses and, as a result, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act is more sound bite than reality; and, therefore, I must oppose the legislation.","word.count":781,"sep11":-2.18258426966292,"years":1999.67696629213,"days":1665,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0902527724530503,"Topic 2":0.157068258269256,"Topic 3":0.00616400226250422,"Topic 4":0.63580211013356,"Topic 5":0.0092840272776002,"Topic 6":0.007068350903344,"Topic 7":0.0072230690249756,"Topic 8":0.022193638557705,"Topic 9":0.0609257697845245,"Topic 10":0.0040180013334809},{"id":"11020080011094","body":"Bennie G.

I also want to thank the chairman of the subcommittee where I am the ranking member, which would be Mr. Lungren. And I rise in support of the Democratic motion to instruct conferees on H.R. 4954, the SAFE Port Act. Now, why would we have a motion to instruct that would include things about freight and about mass transit and surface transportation security? Well, the reason is that the Senate side is taking up those issues; and they are good issues. I mean, look how long it took us to get here to do port security. We should be just as concerned to do rail security, mass transit security, surface transportation security. As Ms. Harman said, when you get done with the port, the container keeps going through the neighborhood on trucks, it goes through in freight through the railroad tracks. So it doesn't stop at the port. We need to do it all. For example, today we held a hearing, as Chairman Lungren said, on a very important issue, the training for the security of transportation employees. Not the ones at the airport where we have done a lot of training, we have put a lot of money, but the ones for busses, mass transit, railroad, freight workers. Mr. Speaker, this was a very important hearing because things have happened on buses and trains, like Madrid and London. We need to ensure that transit and rail employees receive adequate training on how to recognize and report potential threats; how to protect themselves; and how to help us, the passengers, if there is a disaster going on; how they would respond in an incident. And there are other provisions in this motion to instruct: establish a national alert response system to ensure that populations are alerted if there is a serious threat; require the Department of Homeland Security to perform vulnerability assessments of freight and passenger rail and make recommendations on how to improve their security; and establish a program to increase the tracking and communications technology on trucks that carry hazardous materials. These are some of the critical issues that this motion to instruct encompasses. So all of this work, Mr. Thompson, Ms. Harman, myself, Mr. Lungren, Mr. King, is very important, and I am thrilled we are at this point. But we can add more, and it will be good. We cannot wait another 5 years like we did with port security. We should do it now. I urge my colleagues to support improving rail, mass transit, surface transportation, and port security.

This was no small task and they, along with other conferees and staff, are to be commended. Despite these efforts, however, the final conference report includes objectionable maritime cargo scanning language that could be devastating to both the international and domestic flow of commerce. The decision to mandate scanning for 100 percent of cargo containers is a risky proposition because it does not follow a risk-based approach: The title of the final conference report clearly states that its purpose is to implement the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. But the commission did not advocate for the scanning--or even screening--of 100 percent of the containers arriving at our shores. The 9/11 Commission recommended instead that we mitigate our vulnerabilities to terrorism in a logical manner by applying our resources based on risk, and specifically cautioned us not to employ a blanket approach. Our Nation's ports, including the Port of Anchorage, are vital to our economies--both regional and national. Ensuring their security must be a top priority. But a mandate to scan every cargo container entering the U.S. could shut down many of these ports, and the resulting delays for both imports and exports would be excessive and costly for consumers. Moreover, it is likely that foreign nations will disregard any caveats we may provide, and according to a European union diplomat, The E.U. would consider imposing reciprocal requirements and filing a complaint against the United States in the World Trade Organization. This fact renders the approach taken by this bill with respect to scanning cargo unworkable internationally. Here at home, these cargo scanning provisions may be equally, if not more, devastating to rural economies. Communities in the lower 48 are served by multiple transportation modes distributing basic supplies like food and other consumer goods. In Alaska, however, over 90 percent of our supplies flow through the Port of Anchorage. Any disruption at this port would be a disaster for Alaskans, not to mention to the Port of Tacoma, which serves as a conduit for cargo transiting to and from Alaska. Some contend that we are not doing enough for port security. I disagree. Not even one year ago, we passed the Safe Port Act. While many of us made these same arguments concerning 100 percent scanning during the debate of that bill, we ultimately settled on directing DHS to conduct a pilot program to determine whether 100 percent scanning of cargo containers is even feasible. The pilot began earlier this year and we are only now beginning to get a clearer picture of the complexities that scanning entails. Mandating 100 percent scanning of cargo containers without the benefit of the results of the pilot tests is premature and counterproductive. Homeland security should not be used as a rhetorical tool. Let us first learn from the lessons promised by the Safe Port Act's pilot tests before committing ourselves to an irrational, costly, and potentially ineffective approach to securing our Nation.

As our population continues to grow older, we must be prepared to face the reality of these horrible crimes. As leaders in our communities, we must be prepared to deal with this growing problem of elder abuse. All too often seniors are taken advantage of in their own homes. Many perpetrators see senior citizens as easy targets who are both vulnerable and oftentimes unable to defend themselves. It is our responsibility to help protect our elders from these criminals and to ensure that they feel safe within their own homes. I have been working closely with the local agencies, law enforcement agencies and the FBI to develop legislation that will effectively protect senior citizens from abuse. H.R. 3181 does this. H.R. 3181, the Older and Disabled Americans Criminal Protection Act, authorizes shared housing agencies to run background checks on potential caretakers. Shared housing agencies give seniors the opportunity to remain within their own homes by matching them with a caretaker who cares for them in lieu of rent. Unfortunately, shared housing agencies do not have the proper tools to help ensure the safety of these senior citizens. H.R. 3181 gives shared housing agencies the proper mechanism to run State and FBI background checks on potential caretakers before placing them in the home of a senior citizen. The local police departments in my district along with the FBI have commended H.R. 3181 as a proactive effort to prevent crime. They recognize the growing problem of elder abuse and realize that my bill attacks these crimes by lessening the chance that they will ever occur. As people grow older, remaining in their homes should increase their level of comfort and security, not threaten it. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in this effort to protect our loved ones and to battle the growing problem of elder abuse.

So we are not prepared to try to--we don't want to duck that issue or other education and taxes-for-education-related issues. I will tell you what we would like not to do. We would first like to stay on and talk about education and how to improve education in America. We would like the amendments to relate to improving the quality of education. What we would prefer not to do is debate amendments on this bill that have to do with the sale of livestock. That is one of the amendments that I understand somebody wants to offer--to amend the Internal Revenue Code to exclude gain or loss for the sale of livestock from computation of capital gain net income for the purposes of the earned income credit. That is something I might be for, but I don't think it relates to education and an education bill. You talk about let us have a good debate about education. Do we want to get off into cows? And there are several others. Senator Wellstone wants to debate welfare reform on an education bill, food stamps on an education bill. There will be other times where those amendments can be offered. But I think to agree to a reasonable list of education amendments or tax amendments related to education, to have that kind of debate is fine. I think we can work that out if they are education related. But I don't think getting into all these other issues serves the purposes of getting a focused debate on education and getting this bill to a conclusion so that we can go to other, even emergency, pieces of legislation. Let me take, for example, the bill Senator Dodd just mentioned. He is right. I have, over the years, worked to try to support the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA. But I note that the administration flat-lined that program. They did not provide the funds we promised, did not provide for increasing funds in that area. Yet, the Budget Committee this past week voted to add $2.5 billion over 5 years to get the funding up for that program. So you can be assured, as the year goes forward, that we are going to have a debate about how much more money is needed for IDEA. But what we don't think we should have is what the Senator from Connecticut is proposing, which is to turn that program into another entitlement program--mandated appropriations, which would be an entitlement program. We need to face up to the fact that this is an important education program that, quite frankly, is having real difficulties now because we have not provided the funding we said we were going to give. What it really has to do with is, we should not make it mandatory or an entitlement; we should live up to what we said we were going to do.","word.count":606,"sep11":-3.56179775280899,"years":1998.29775280899,"days":1174,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.140239886959743,"Topic 2":0.253949883543696,"Topic 3":0.00513705848726279,"Topic 4":0.010311988410474,"Topic 5":0.00848888571303905,"Topic 6":0.00634416712548442,"Topic 7":0.416790022342177,"Topic 8":0.0178061589414196,"Topic 9":0.135039674015799,"Topic 10":0.00589227446090524},{"id":"10519980019085","body":"Gerald Solomon: Mr. Speaker, I would like to make two announcements.

Indeed, he offered it during the markup of the Governmental Affairs Committee. It was debated at length. Initially, in considering this issue, I, too, was inclined to believe that the new national intelligence director should have some sort of term of office. However, the testimony we heard through our eight hearings changed my mind in this regard. Under our legislation, S. 2845, the NID serves as the principal adviser to the President. The individual not only manages the intelligence community and heads up the new national intelligence authority, but serves as the principal adviser to the President. I am stressing that role because I believe that is key to why the director, in fact, should not have a fixed term. It is essential that the NID enjoy the full confidence and trust of the President of the United States. That was a point made by the 9/11 Commission chairman, Tom Kean, at our very first hearing on July 30. But we heard that repeated time and again by our witnesses. All of the former DCIs who came before the committee, representing a variety of times and administrations, were unanimous in their view that the new NID should serve at the pleasure of the President. The then Acting Director of the CIA John McLaughlin made the point at our September 8 hearing that for the NID to successfully clarify our assignment of serving as the principal adviser to the President, he must enjoy the President's trust and confidence. Consider a situation where the Presidency changes parties during that 10-year-period. It would be very awkward for a new President of a different party to inherit the national intelligence director from the previous administration. Their world views and philosophy may have nothing in common. Yet the President has to have a close and trusting relationship with the national intelligence director. The President should be able to choose his or her own person for that critical post. Proponents of having a 10-year term have frequently compared this proposal to the 10-year term of the Director of the FBI. I would note that I asked Director Mueller whether he thought the new NID should have a 10-year term similar to his. He said he did not think a 10-year term or any fixed term was appropriate for the national intelligence director. He said the role of the FBI Director is very different from the role of the national intelligence director. Over and over again during our hearings, Senator Lieberman and I raised this question with the witnesses because we, too, were trying to reach the right determination. Over and over again, the advice was the same, whether it was the 9/11 Commission, the Acting Director of the CIA, the former Directors of the CIA, or Director Mueller of the FBI. Over and over again, they advised against setting a term. So we need to create a position where the individual will enjoy the full confidence and trust of the President of the United States. That is the only way that individual can effectively carry out the role he is assigned in this legislation to serve as the President's principal intelligence adviser. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment of the Senator from Pennsylvania.","word.count":558,"sep11":3.12921348314607,"years":2004.98876404494,"days":3556,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.139963424824601,"Topic 2":0.472024520437957,"Topic 3":0.00770905369416698,"Topic 4":0.0242424610775187,"Topic 5":0.0183375244724945,"Topic 6":0.00683577818060589,"Topic 7":0.0100906899230986,"Topic 8":0.170837615823637,"Topic 9":0.056511190748128,"Topic 10":0.0934477408177923},{"id":"10419960056799","body":"Edward Kennedy: No. That is completely untrue. I just ask those that are coming up with those speeches to read the debate over in the House of Representatives, where the same examples are being used. These are pat and standard, evidently, speeches being handed out and used by our colleagues here, because the same language is included in the House debate. I do not know whether it would be worthwhile to include the debate that took place over in the House. But I urge my colleagues to read it because I think it is incisive as to what this whole issue is really about. I thank the Senator very much for those interrogatories. I will just speak briefly about this legislation that is before us. As I mentioned earlier, my good friend and highly regarded chairperson of our committee, Senator Kassebaum, indicated that the principal reason for this legislation was some ambiguity in terms of the language of certain holdings. I find myself at odds with that understanding and, if that is the difficulty, it is certainly not reflected in the number of cases that are being brought to the NLRB. If you look at the period of last year, and the year before, you are talking about a handful of cases. It is not of such an urgency because even if there is a finding that there is some misunderstanding about what a company can or cannot do, there are no penalties. There are problems out there in terms of protecting workers and workers' rights. But, quite frankly, this does not appear to be one of them. As I mentioned earlier, it is interesting to me that those who are pushing this particular proposal--you can go back and examine the testimony before the Dunlop Commission, in 1993, made up of a bipartisan group of labor relation experts in business and academia. They conducted an intensive study of labor-management cooperation and employee participation. And the committee held 21 public hearings, and had testimony from 411 witnesses, and received and reviewed numerous reports and studies. The commission made one recommendation that is of particular relevance. This is the recommendation: ``The law should continue to make it illegal to set up or operate company-dominated forms of employee representation.'' That is one of the strong recommendations, and that runs completely contrary to the antiworkplace democracy act. It is for very sound reasons, Mr. President. It makes no sense for a company and a CEO to pretend to represent workers when that individual has bought that representation lock, stock, and barrel, with the paycheck. It is a disservice to those employees to appoint a worker and to say, ``Well, that worker is going to represent all of you in the workplace, and I am paying him. I have the ability to dismiss him, and I have the ability to fire him tomorrow. I have the ability to tell him when they are going to have a meeting and what the agenda is going to be.'' That is what this legislation effectively does. It says that an employer can name anyone they want to be the representative of workers, and that individual is going to be paid by the employer, who can fire them the moment that person makes a recommendation or a suggestion that is at odds with the employer or the CEO, and they will set the agenda for that worker and tell them what the nature of the debate is going to be, and tell them who that worker will recognize in any debate, and effectively control that person. Now, if you call that representing employees, Mr. President, I do not. That does not represent the employees. That is what this legislation is about. It is not about just issues of cooperation. As I mentioned just yesterday, in the legislation, S. 295, the bill introduced by Senator Kassebaum, on page 2, it says: That is good. It is happening. That is taking place today. The report itself recognizes it. On page 99, the report talks about the commission on the future of worker-management relations. The survey found that 75 percent of responding employers, large and small, incorporate some means of employee involvement in their operation, meaning that larger employers, those with 5,000 or more employees, the percentage was even higher--96 percent. It is estimated that as many as 30,000 employers currently employ some form of employee involvement or participation. Amen. That is the way to go. We urge that. It is taking place. We looked at the provisions. If there is some question about that, we looked at the various provisions to understand what is included and permitted and what would be prohibited. Basically, we are talking about encouraging people and company employee teams to work on everything other than the wages and the hours and the exact working conditions. There has been a point in talking about, Well, what about certain types of working conditions? I had hoped at least to be able to address that issue and work with our Republican colleagues to clarify that. I think those measures have been clarified in the proposal that was advanced in the House of Representatives when it talked about three different committees that would be set up and how they would be set up to address any possible question about what is permitted and what is not permitted. But that was summarily dismissed in the House of Representatives, which gives you a pretty good idea about what is underlying this bill. As a matter of fact, in the House of Representatives, they even excluded these kinds of activities in the House version--excluded the companies' employees who already had voted for representation. That was the Petri amendment to H.R. 743. We have not done so in this legislation. Mr. President, I want to just take a few moments to talk about why this concept is, I think, a dangerous one for working families, those families that are represented by the 120 million Americans who are in the workplace virtually every single day, not just the 13.5 million who are members of the trade union movement, but all working Americans. We know--and we have examined here on the floor very considerably--what has happened to the American work force from 1947 to 1970. All Americans had moved up with the expansion of the economy. All had moved up. What we have seen since 1972 to 1992 is that more than 60 percent of Americans have actually fallen further and further behind. It is close to about 75 percent. Many of us believe that is a major issue and challenge for us as a society. It boils down to one basic question. Are we going to have an economy in the United States of America that is only going to benefit the richest and the most powerful individuals in our country and society, or are we going to have an economy in which all Americans participate in a growing economy? I believe that was really the concept that was supported by Republicans and Democrats for years, and years, and years. It is now being undermined by these assaults on working families. We saw it in the early part of this Congress when one of the first actions of our Republican friends was to try to eliminate the Davis-Bacon Act. The Davis-Bacon Act provides a prevailing wage for workers who work in a particular geographical area. It works out effectively to about $27,000 a year for working families that work in construction. I do not know what it is about our Republican friends that they feel that one of the major problems in this country is to try to undermine workers that are working for $27,000 a year. There are a lot of problems that we have in our society, but that does not seem to me to be uppermost, and it should be uppermost in the minds of the Members of the Senate. But that was there. Then, second, we have gone along a few weeks. We saw the assault on the earned-income tax credit. That is important as we are talking about the increase in the minimum wage because the earned-income tax credit helps those workers that are on the bottom rung of the economic ladder and who have children, and it goes on up to $25,000, $26,000, and $27,000. Sure enough. We saw that the one part of the Republic budget that was before the Senate was not only to provide $270 billion in tax cuts for the wealthy individuals but to cut back on that help and support for working families that have children. It was about the same time that Republican opposition came about in terms of opposition to the increase in the minimum wage; about the same time. What is it about--$27,000 for construction workers and $23,000 for working families with children--the opposition to the increase in the minimum wage that helps working families if they are by themselves, or just a couple? Families are aided more by the earned-income tax credit if they have several members in their families and working in that particular area. But we have the cutbacks in the earned-income tax credit and the opposition in terms of the increase in the minimum wage. Then we came out on the floor of the U.S. Senate on that budget which provided corporate raiders the opportunity to invade pension funds. We had a vote here of 94 to 5 to close that out. That went over to conference with the House of Representatives, and the doors had not even closed, and the action that was taken overwhelmingly by the Senate was effectively eliminated. We should not have been so surprised at that because when we tried to close the billionaires' tax cut that provides billions and billions of dollars to a handful of Americans who make it in the United States and then renounce their citizenship--the Benedict Arnold provisions--and take up citizenship overseas to escape paying their taxes here, we repealed that two different times, and we could not kill it. We went over in the conference, and it kept coming back. There just was not a tax break out there for powerful interests that the majority was not prepared to support. Here they go again looking after the company heads, those heads of companies that want to set up phony unions and exploit the workers. That is what this is all about. It was virtually unanimously rejected by the Dunlop Co","word.count":3012,"sep11":-5.48314606741573,"years":1996.37640449438,"days":490,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.209374359692398,"Topic 2":0.344658058301649,"Topic 3":0.0118345102638342,"Topic 4":0.00988516208870185,"Topic 5":0.0993641261630395,"Topic 6":0.00929165369913519,"Topic 7":0.00944871739395279,"Topic 8":0.134131021405933,"Topic 9":0.157964518599543,"Topic 10":0.0140478723918135},{"id":"10519980036643","body":"Benjamin Gilman: Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4578, the Save Social Security Act, and I urge my colleagues to support this worthy legislation. The intent of this legislation is to establish a new account in which surplus moneys from the Social Security trust fund will be deposited. In doing so, this will start to address the long-term solvency of the Social Security Program. This bill designates $1.4 trillion of the surplus to shoring up Social Security. This amounts to 90 percent of the projected surplus. The remaining 10 percent will be used for providing tax relief for middle-class Americans. The $1.4 trillion being set aside for Social Security is more than sufficient to both repay borrowed trust fund surpluses from previous years, as well as meet the demands that will be placed on the system in the coming decade. While Social Security has been an unparalleled success over the past 60 years, its future is being driven by negative demographic trends. The Baby Boomer generation is nearing retirement and subsequent generations are not large enough to subsidize the boomers' projected demands on the Social Security system. Current projections show that the Social Security system will start paying out more in benefits than it receives in contributions by the year 2013. This incoming/outgoing ratio will gradually worsen until the program reaches insolvency in 2032. The problems facing Social Security are not immediate. However, the longer we wait to make reforms, the more painful those reforms will be. It is important to address this subject while our window of opportunity remains open. Furthermore, Congress needs to do this in a manner that is above politics. The subject of Social Security reform is far too important to be influenced by partisan politics. Accordingly, Mr. Speaker, Social Security has played a vital role in our Nation's success and prosperity this century. I urge my colleagues to support this worthy legislation to ensure that it continues to do so long into the future.","word.count":331,"sep11":-3.03651685393258,"years":1998.82303370787,"days":1361,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.133658749079949,"Topic 2":0.042510905271129,"Topic 3":0.0672971808712562,"Topic 4":0.0048892889998775,"Topic 5":0.0237620569318148,"Topic 6":0.352747150896093,"Topic 7":0.0193466488285133,"Topic 8":0.333776022546533,"Topic 9":0.018157202785765,"Topic 10":0.003854793789069},{"id":"10920060052427","body":"Jeff Sessions: Mr. President, I would like to share a few thoughts about the Strategic Forces Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee, which I chair, which deals with space, missile defense, satellites, and many of the other high-tech systems on which our Defense Department relies. But I just want to respond to my colleague, Senator Durbin. I don't think he actually meant to say that our soldiers are coming home broken in body and spirit, but he came close. That is not what I am hearing. Go out to Walter Reed. They may have broken bodies and broken bones, but they are not broken in spirit. The night before last, I attended a wonderful ceremony of the 231st birthday of the U.S. Army. I was talking with soldiers there. We were talking about the war and the politics of the Capitol. They are aware of what is going on. I told them that I thought the Congress would not vote for any immediate withdrawal, and indeed we voted yesterday 93 to 6 against any kind of withdrawal requirement for this year. That vote, represents a strong bipartisan consensus of the Senate. One of those soldiers said: I will tell you what we want, Senator; ``We want to win.'' We want to win this war. That is what the American people want, that is what the soldiers who have gone there and sacrificed want, and that is what they believe in. The soldiers who have been there believe in what they have done. They have been courageous in performing their mission. It is difficult for me and for them to understand this idea that we can support the soldiers but not support the mission we sent them on, sent them by a three-fourths vote of this Senate. A majority of Democrats and Republicans voted for this war, and we are going to stay the course, we are going to help our military succeed, and we are going to help them win. The point I pick up more and more as I talk with these soldiers, what I am hearing from them, is they are afraid we are going to mess it up. They believe they are winning. They believe they are doing their job. They believe they will be successful. And they are really worried that this Congress will be the one that will lose its nerve and not stand with them after they put their lives on the line for this country. I believe this is a big deal, and that success in Iraq is important for our Nation. I visited that region recently. I talked to the leaders of Turkey, Kuwait, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. What would it mean for us if we had a disastrous event in Iraq where the terrorists take over that country? What would it mean to their neighbors? What would it mean to the region? All nations of good will know we must succeed. Iraq is stepping up. There are now 260,000 Iraqi soldiers and security personnel in uniform and reaching higher and higher levels of performance. They are doing a much better job every day. They will soon be at 350,000 by the end of this year. They are being better equipped and better trained, and I believe we are doing a much smarter job of imbedding our soldiers with the Iraqi units so we can call in air support, we can provide mentoring, we can provide advice, we can call on other kinds of support, if they need it, to be effective. A majority of the raids and actions that are taking place in Iraq are taking place by the Iraqis. Iraqi soldiers are taking more casualties than American soldiers. We are not babysitting them. This image of millions casting their ballots for a freely elected government of Iraq is not a bad image for us to remember. We need to remember that, and it is important for us, let me note first and foremost, that this Nation not allow the terrorists to win in Iraq. We are going to be successful. But I realize the American people are concerned. They don't like to see violence and continued death. They don't like to see our soldiers at risk. I certainly understand that; neither do I. I have been an admirer of General Abizaid, CENTCOM commander, and his team of generals because General Abizaid has always resisted the temptation to see how many troops we can put in Iraq. He said that is not the way to win this war. We need the right number of troops, and we need to begin to draw them down as soon as it is appropriate to draw them down and lift up the Iraqi Army. That is what we need to do. Some want to have the President set forth a detailed plan so they can criticize it, basically. How will some sort of formalized plan help our soldiers be effective in the battle? It just tells your enemy what you are going to be doing. More importantly, a detailed plan is not going to be permanent. It will have to change because the enemy changes. As soon as you shut off one avenue of enemy success, they take another one and you have to respond to that. That is the history of warfare. That is the way wars have always been fought: you constantly adjust and constantly alter your efforts to be successful toward your ultimate goal of victory. That is what our military is doing. Trying to demand a date from our military to withdraw or trying to demand from them a plan of what they are going to do 5 months from now fails to understand and recognize the nature of this conflict, and this conflict more than most conflicts because we face an asymmetrical enemy, a nontraditional enemy, who knows it cannot stand and fight our military successfully, so it devises devious and sneaky ways to pit one religion against another, to attack American soldiers, to attack the local police, all designed to crumble the Government of Iraq. But it hasn't happened. Iraqis are still signing up and becoming policemen. Iraqis are still signing up and the army is growing. The Government of Iraq has elected, for the first time, their permanent leadership. Prime Minister Maliki is in office. His whole Cabinet now has been established. The two key Cabinet positions on which they spent extra time, Defense and Interior, have now been established, confirmed and voted by the 275 member Parliament. So they have their government now, fully elected, a permanent government, just like any other nation in the world. There is no interim government now. I believe they are going to be successful, and I tell you, it is going to be important for the United States that they are. We have invested a lot; our soldiers have invested a lot. They are proud of what they are doing. They are not broken in spirit. They want to be successful and win. I have some numbers I will share with my colleagues and those around the country who might be listening. In this conflict, the Army has had the largest number of people serving in Iraq, yet their enlistment rate through May of this year was 104.3 percent. They have exceeded their enlistment goals for this year. They have exceeded their reenlistment goals. The Army for a few months did miss their goals, and some critics said it was a broken Army and predicted disaster. The Army said: No, we are not broken, and we are going to meet our goals. For 13 consecutive months, the Army has met its goals. The highest retention reenlistment rates come from the units that have just come back from Iraq and Afghanistan. Staff Sergeant Barr, who was at Walter Reed, was injured by an explosive device. He was punctured by as many as 100 different pieces of shrapnel. He was told he would have difficulty walking and would probably never run again. He said he was going to run again, and he was going back to Iraq with the unit that he came with. And he worked at it and he worked at it and he ran. He eventually went back to Iraq and served again. That is the kind of spirit that we have. That is the kind of spirit that you see in our Army. I was told by an officer who knew that story that every single soldier in his squad reenlisted. This is the spirit that this Congress needs to strive to be worthy of. This is the kind of professional commitment and courage that inspires us, or should inspire us. We should not be whining around here and trying to find some error that was made somewhere where body armor did not get to a soldier. Body armor is out there protecting soldiers. It is not a problem. To say that there has never been a shortage somewhere or somehow a supply failed to get where it was supposed to, I can't say; but it is not a systemic problem. But to go around and suggest to the citizens of our country that this Congress and the military is not committed to providing body armor to our soldiers is bogus and false and undermines what they are doing. It must be most confusing to our soldiers there. But I think the vote yesterday should give them confidence that most of this talk is simply politics. Most of it is just complaining and second-guessing, like is done on the floor of the Senate every day. We hear it every day on many issues and debate and criticism is passed of the strength of American Government. But I would urge my colleagues to think differently about soldiers in conflict, soldiers in harm's way. We need to be careful what we are saying here. It may sound good, it may hurt President Bush, to make this allegation or that allegation, but is it perhaps creating in the eyes of our enemies a belief that we are divided, that we won't stay the course, and that if they just kill enough people, civilians, Americans, Iraqis, that somehow, it will all just fail. Is that the possibility that we are creating? That is why I urge my colleagues to be very careful and watch what you say in terms of attacks on the efforts that our military have so courageously undertaken in Iraq. Things happen in war. Bad things happen. But no military has done a better job of striving for perfection than ours has. I would also like to respond to charges that this Nation is going to be embarrassed historically because we have tortured people that were captured in this war on terrorism. We talked about Lincoln. Lincoln eliminated the writ of habeas corpus. Roosevelt, as Senator Durbin said, locked people up, Japanese Americans, in a way that was not justified.

This legislation would authorize $600 billion in spending for our Nation's Armed Forces, including $530 billion in spending for defense programs at the Pentagon and Energy Departments and $70 billion to bolster the success of ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan for part of 2009. It would authorize $783 million for continued procurement and enhancement of current body armor systems; $1 billion for the training and support of the Iraqi security forces; and nearly $2 billion for unfunded readiness initiatives as requested by the services. It increases Active Duty Army personnel, Mr. Speaker, by 7,000 and Active Duty Marine Corps personnel by 5,000, while also providing our uniformed servicemembers with a much-deserved pay raise of 3.9 percent. And for our active duty troops and veterans who have already done so much to serve our country, it prohibits increased copayments and premiums for TRICARE recipients, and expands suicide prevention efforts. Finally, Mr. Speaker, this legislation also requires the Secretary of Defense to provide an annual report on Iran's nuclear capabilities so that this Congress can take a proactive role on recognizing the potential of this threat and be made aware of the threat that these capabilities pose to America and our allies. While this legislation does a great deal to improve our armed services and to provide them with the resources that they need--and it accomplishes much of this in a cooperative, bipartisan fashion--there are a few areas that I think could still be greatly improved. While the Rules Committee has not yet reported out a rule governing amendment debate on this legislation--we will do that this afternoon--I want to take this opportunity to make clear that there are a number of areas that I and a number of my Republican colleagues believe can be used to improve this bill through the amendment process. First, it is my hope that the amendment process for this year's authorization bill, while it will be a structured rule, will still be as open as it has been under Republican majority, when between 30 and 40 amendments were regularly allowed to be debated and decided by the entire House of Representatives. Of particular concern is the reduction in funds and focus that the Armed Services Committee chose to provide in this bill for protecting America from the threat posed by ballistic missiles. In the Armed Services Committee, my colleague Terry Everett from Alabama offered amendments to both authorize the President's request fully for missile defense and allow procurement to go forward and to restore half of the $10 million that the committee eliminated from the request for the study of a space test bed. Congressman Trent Franks of Arizona, a fellow cochairman of the Missile Defense Caucus, offered his own amendment to add $100 million to a program to launch multiple interceptor missiles at once to defeat multiple incoming missiles or decoys in the event of an attack. While these amendments, Mr. Speaker, were defeated in committee, I believe that the entire House should have the opportunity to hear their arguments and make their own decisions on these issues, as well as the amendment by my Rules Committee colleague, Mr. Sessions of Texas, to state the sense of Congress that we need to support the development, testing, and fielding of the capability to intercept ballistic missiles in their boost phase to protect America's interests. Again, Mr. Speaker, while this rule provides for 2 hours of general debate on the bill, there are areas that this House needs and deserves to address through the amendment process. That will be addressed in the second rule that we will discuss in the Rules Committee tonight and will presumably be on the floor tomorrow. I certainly hope that the House is given a full and fair chance to consider these issues that I've highlighted, as well as others. With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.","word.count":722,"sep11":6.86516853932584,"years":2008.72471910112,"days":4886,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0119031073712899,"Topic 2":0.0276211583864789,"Topic 3":0.111689894311877,"Topic 4":0.00923348598613943,"Topic 5":0.00799643387842805,"Topic 6":0.0488104577789554,"Topic 7":0.196433922093517,"Topic 8":0.121982373568907,"Topic 9":0.442000243577301,"Topic 10":0.0223289230471066},{"id":"11020070005072","body":"Ducan Hunter: Mr. Speaker, I insist on my point of order.

I, too, heard what the Republicans were just saying. The American people are a lot of things, but they are not fools. They know that the President is a Republican. They know that the Senate is in the hands of the Republicans. They know that this House of Representatives is in the hands of the Republicans. The Republicans are leading the country. When Democrats were leading this country, at least one of our Presidents, President Truman, said, the buck stops here. Not these. They say the buck stops with the Democrats when we are the minority party. There is not a bill we can get passed here because we are the minority party. It is wrong as wrong can be for the Republicans to point fingers and try to blame the Democrats for this huge increase in prices. This belongs where it ought to be: On the failed policies of the President. Now, I like the President. I find the President to be a very fine person, and I hold him in great personal esteem, but I totally disagree with his policies. And the people of this country disagree with his policies. Now let us talk about the truth. We have had the Truth Squad just speak, and I am sort of reminded of this story of a good friend of mine. Her name was Isabella. One day in New York City Isabella had a vision, and so she changed her name to Sojourner Truth. She went all over this country speaking, and everywhere she went, people would ask her about her funny name. She would say, Let me tell you about my funny name. The Lord gave me ``Sojourner'' so I could travel the world showing the people and speaking to them. But I told the Lord I needed another name, and he gave me ``Truth'' so I could tell the truth to people. Mr. Ross, that is what the American people are expecting us to do tonight, to be sojourners of truth and to tell the truth. There is no more burning issue. Yes, we must talk about the deficit, but we have to talk about this gas price. We have to talk about the raising of it because it is what is on the hearts and minds and souls of the American people. They are fed up to here with these huge, gigantic gas spikes and gas prices. Many people can't even make it. I was just out in my district in Douglas County down on Dorsett Shoals Road this past Sunday. And one of my constituents, a little lady, came out and said, Congressman, please do something about these gas prices. Where is our country headed? Where are we going? Please do something about securing our borders. Where is our country going? I am here to tell you, Mr. Ross, the American people are very, very concerned about the lack of direction and going in the wrong direction that this country is headed in. Nowhere is it more startling than in these gas prices. Now, let me bring this to your attention, Mr. Ross, because this really gets to me. And I want to talk about this for a moment. In this article, I think it was from one of the media, the New York Times or Washington Post. I don't have it correct. But they began to talk about something that brings home the point. Now, let me preface this by saying, I am a capitalist. I was trained at the best school of business in the world, the citadel of capitalism, the Wharton School of Finance where I got my MBA. Served on the board of directors there for 6 years. So I am a capitalist. I believe in the profit motive. I understand all of that. But listen to this that we hear about the CEO at Exxon-Mobil. For his efforts, Mr. Lee Raymond, who retired in December, was compensated more than $686 million from 1993 to 2005, according to an analysis done for the New York Times by Brian Foley, an independent compensation consultant. That amounts to $144,573, every day. Now, I am for profit. But there is a difference between profit and greed, and that is what is upsetting the American people. At a time when we have diminishing oil resources, at a time that the fuel prices are skyrocketing, these oil companies are making huge profits. Now, all I say is this: Don't we owe it to the American people to ask these executives from these oil companies to come before Congress and explain this to us? The American people are asking questions. I know your constituents are asking questions: How can it be? And not only that, if we move over to Chairman Ray Irani of Occidental Petroleum, He received $63 million in total compensation just last year. And over the past 3 years, Irani has reaped more than $135 million. I am not kicking anybody for making money. This is a free enterprise system. It is a capitalistic system. But we are not dealing with peanuts. We are not dealing with renewable stuff. We are dealing with a life and death, very valuable diminishing resource called oil that we are dependent on, not just for us to make our economy go. It also is the juice that enables us to fight our wars, protect this country. There is a lot at stake with this. Meanwhile, we want the truth. Here are the facts: the price of gas, while all of these profits are going on, the price of gas has doubled. Profits for big oil and gas companies have quadrupled at the time that gas prices have zoomed up, while American families' incomes have been stagnated. Many small independent gas stations are reporting that they are being gouged by big oil companies. Now, if they are saying that, shouldn't we investigate? Shouldn't we take a look? That is all that I am saying. I am saying we need to bring the oil industry individuals in and get them under oath to provide us with some answers. No, this is not a Democrat or Republican situation. It is all of our situation. But I tell you, when they are in charge, it is wrong to blame us.","word.count":1064,"sep11":4.73876404494382,"years":2006.59831460674,"days":4129,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.10196947878251,"Topic 2":0.410554744800169,"Topic 3":0.0388459223642986,"Topic 4":0.0126933341734747,"Topic 5":0.0113859830152834,"Topic 6":0.0366370451898145,"Topic 7":0.0501715366104306,"Topic 8":0.0133563790465613,"Topic 9":0.268216194960392,"Topic 10":0.0561693810570655},{"id":"10619990022065","body":"Bernard Sanders: Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, this is part of the continuing effort of this House on a bipartisan basis to reign in maybe the loose security or the mistakes we have all made in the security at the Los Alamos lab, and this is not directed at anything. This is supposed to be a constructive amendment. The idea behind it is, we had the situation, as all Members of the House well know and all Members of the House are concerned about, that has to do with the disappearance of two highly sensitive disks, computer disks, that contained nuclear secrets. The disks disappeared and reappeared, and during that period of time, we are not exactly sure what happened. We do know that they searched behind a copying machine, and then later, they researched behind there and found out that they were there. It appears that they were kind of stuck in after the search. What we are trying to do as a Government is to investigate this and yet much to our dismay, I believe on a bipartisan basis, we have employees out there who have refused to take a polygraph test. Mr. Chairman, we have a precedent now. We have a law that can require employees in sensitive areas to take polygraph tests and certainly employees who are dealing with nuclear secrets are in highly sensitive areas, and what this simply says is that if you will not take a polygraph test and you are working in a highly-sensitive area, we are not going to pay you. We are urging employees and have the lawful right to do that. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.","word.count":618,"sep11":-2.21910112359551,"years":1999.6404494382,"days":1652,"party":"Other","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.258677845756717,"Topic 2":0.0442804929726398,"Topic 3":0.258941118667702,"Topic 4":0.323111912743568,"Topic 5":0.0106296999580791,"Topic 6":0.0367094042909674,"Topic 7":0.0127155009653234,"Topic 8":0.0378964211100795,"Topic 9":0.0109981425311345,"Topic 10":0.00603946100378863},{"id":"10720020063845","body":"Sam Brownback: Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that will clarify the status of North Korean refugees. As a Nation, the United States is the world's leader in the protection of refugees. The world takes its lead from the United States when reacting to asylum-seekers, and the example we set have far- reaching implications for those who flee persecution. For this reason, we have stood firm against excuses for the denial of basic human rights and life's basic liberties. The tenuous status of North Korean refugees in China is well documented. As we all know from news reports, including several news programs, that few North Koreans are able to seek asylum and refuge, be it in China or elsewhere. The few that do, however, are functionally barred from seeking asylum in the United States or being admitted to the United States as refugees. As I understand it, the State Department has expressed concerns that the legal hurdle to admitting North Koreans refugees is the fact that South Korea automatically conveys its citizenship to any escapee from North Korea who makes it to South Korea. In short, the State Department claims it cannot, as a matter of law, consider any North Korean to be a refugee. I am not persuaded that this is the case, but even if we assume that to be true, we must stand firm for the proposition that the moral obligation that we have for refugees everywhere seeking basic human liberties should not be laid aside because of that legal technicality and it should not preclude the United State from providing refugee protections to North Korean refugees. The bill I am introducing today clarifies and fixes that technicality. It says quite simply that, for asylum and refugee purposes, a North Korean is a North Korean. This bill in no way detracts from the generosity of the South Korean government or the South Korean people. It does not encourage refugees to choose the United States over South Korea as a safe haven. Far from it, since those refugees who are able to reach South Korea will go there and will be afforded the rights that refugees escaping from persecution rightfully deserve whether under various international conventions or the South Korean Constitution. Instead, this bill recognizes the physical obstacles facing North Korean refugees and removes the technicality that compromises our ability to help them. The bill I am introducing today has the support of the Lawyers Committee on Human Rights, Amnesty International, the International Rescue Committee, the U.S. Committee on Refugees, Immigration and Refugee Services of America, among others.

It increases function 700 for veterans by $13 billion over the period of 1997 to 2002, and to pay for that it increases the reconciliation instructions for welfare reform by $13 billion which raises the total number under the President's plan from $39 to $52 billion. I think it is time that we get back to talking about the budget which is the subject in front of us today. We have just had a very clear-cut indication in this body that people want to talk about a real budget that does not make drastic cuts in the last year. They said it was a bad idea. This is the first good opportunity to vote on the President's proposal to achieve the balanced budget by taking a tremendous whack out of discretionary programs including those items which he cited as his high priorities in the last 2 years. I am very pleased that our colleagues unanimously on both sides of the aisle said that did not make any sense, and that we should not go at it in a meat ax way. I think we ought to start taking a look at responsible adjustments to try to bring this proposal back into the realm of reality. The amendment that I have just offered has a series of numbers. Those numbers ensure VA medical care will not be one of the victims of the President's drastic outyear cuts, and it also restores the cuts proposed for the years 1998, 1999, and 2000 before the trigger--before the cap--hits. My amendment would bring the VA medical care up to what is included in the Senate Republican budget proposal, an almost $13 billion add-on. As I said, it offsets this by asking for greater savings in welfare. Let me address the second part of that first. After 30 years of ever more expensive and less effective approaches to poverty, last year Congress came up with a plan that we sent to the President which he vetoed which would have reformed welfare in a meaningful way. I think our approach struck a fair balance between the role of the Federal Government in providing a safety net and giving States increased responsibilities. You would have saved $64 billion over 7 years in the process. Since the creation of Aid to Families with Dependent Children, public aid has been regarded as an entitlement. If you meet the requirements for eligibility, you receive the cash with no strings attached. The current system has been rightly maligned by persons from all walks of life, including researchers, advocates, politicians, and even the recipients themselves. They know the system does not work. The system is impersonal. It is inefficient. It encourages continued dependency. I am concerned that, if we do not require recipients of public assistance to work, or at least behave responsibly, or take steps to wean themselves from public assistance, our efforts at reform are just going to be another word for more of the same. Our welfare bill which passed the Senate overwhelmingly on a bipartisan basis had a real work requirement. In that bill, we also permitted States to implement reform ideas without undertaking a lengthy and cumbersome waiver process. States who wanted to require welfare recipients to obtain preventive health care for their children, or to ensure their children stay in school and wish to allow recipients to keep more of their earnings from a part time job--all of them a good idea--now have to go through a waiver process from HHS. It is costly, time consuming, and silly. I have addressed before a silly problem that came up in Sedalia, MO. You have heard me talk about this on previous occasions. But this is the example of what the Federal law, as it now stands, does not permit States to do. The State of Missouri working through their local family services office and the employers in the area decided in Sedalia, MO, to try a pilot program to get people jobs in an expanding new industry in town. People seeking food stamp assistance were sent, if they were able bodied, to the employer for job interviews. If they were offered a job then they got off the need for food stamps. If they refused to show up, or if they were offered a job and refused it, then the State could sanction them, and did not have to give them food stamps. There was a real incentive for these people to make an effort to get work. A lot of them did get work. Some of them did not like the work that was offered. They went out and took another job. That is fine. A lot of people in that community who had been depending upon public assistance went back on the work rolls. Two of the people, however, who were sent to the employer they failed the employer's mandatory drug test. When they went back to the State the State could not cut them off of welfare, or food stamps in this instance, because they had failed a drug test. And the State wants a waiver. The State said this is crazy. And they are right. If we want to get people off of welfare and to work, and we prohibit States from saying, ``If you cannot get a job because you failed the drug test, then we will pull you off the welfare rolls. We will not give you assistance.'' That means, if somebody wants to stay on public assistance and get food stamps, or welfare, all they have to do is take drugs. What a perverse incentive. The State has been battling to get a waiver. My view is the States should not have to get a waiver. The States ought to be permitted to make those commonsense determinations and see what works. The current system that President Clinton is defending by his vetoes keeps those nonsensical requirements in place. Where States, despite the best efforts of the Clinton administration to keep control, have been able to implement significant reforms the results have been astounding. Welfare caseloads have dropped to 25 percent from 30 percent in some States including Massachusetts, Indiana, and Michigan. That is why we are here. More families are able to obtain self-sufficiency which has the added benefit of saving the Federal Government money. As I pointed out, the welfare reform plan that we sent to the President which he vetoed would have saved $64.1 billion over 7 years. In this amendment before us I am proposing that we save $53 billion in welfare programs so that we can keep a promise we made to our Nation's veterans who risked their lives for us that they would always have health care. This, I would think, is not an unrealistic number. The Senate Budget Committee plan calls for $54 billion in welfare savings. Some of the savings would be achieved in the Supplemental Security Income Program, which, as the fastest growing entitlement, desperately needs reform. We can make these savings by reforming the programs and returning them to the States for them to administer, thereby eliminating huge Federal bureaucracies. I think the people of America want to see us get serious about welfare reform. If you believe what the President says--he says we want to change welfare as we know it--I think it is time we did what the people want and the President says rather than rely on the President's veto to keep the status quo. Now, what this will do on the other side, for the Veterans' Administration patients, is to ensure that when they need health care they are not going to be denied. The people who are served in Veterans' Administration facilities around the country are the ones who have been injured in combat overseas and/or those who are medically indigent. This is where they are cared for--in all of these locations. These are 170 Veterans' Administration facilities across the Nation. Last year, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle said that we could not have a flatline of spending in veterans affairs because it would result in closure of four of those hospitals. Frankly, there are savings that can be made in the Veterans' Administration, and I think that those savings are being pursued in the health care area by Dr. Ken Kizer and others. But there is no way that an almost 25-percent cut, $12.9 billion, can do anything but devastate the program. Millions of veterans will not be served. At least a quarter of these hospitals and veterans facilities will have to be shut. Pick a State, any State. As I mentioned earlier, some of the major States like California would probably have to have three or four closures. My home State of Missouri would have to have at least one closure. All of the States with veterans facilities would be faced with losing some of those facilities, as well as service to many of their most needy people. Massachusetts would lose at least one; Washington, at least one; Texas, two; Pennsylvania, two, probably three; Illinois, with six facilities, one or two; and Florida, the same position, at least one or two. I do not think that is acceptable. When we asked the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, who came before our committee, to comment on these proposals, he said he could not live with that scenario. He did not like our scenario, which was a flatline, but I believe they can live with that. But he sure cannot live with a scenario that takes a tremendous whack out of the budget and, beginning after 1997, takes funding for the Veterans' Administration in a precipitous decline. That is why I think we need to have a realistic budget. It is time that we started talking honestly about what our needs are going to be in the future. We are joined in this concern by a number of organizations which have expressed their grave concern over this. The Independent Budget, a group comprised of Amvets, Disabled Veterans, Paralyzed Veterans of America, Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, wrote to Secretary Jesse Brown on May 14, 1996, which I will submit. I received a copy. My colleagues, chairs, and ranking members of the VA-HUD Appropriations Committee, received it. I will cite to you just the middle paragraph of the letter. It says: I send that letter to the desk and ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.

We are already going to have to pay increased payments under this bill. What do our Republican friends have against working families? They raised the EITC that goes to the low-income, working families. And now they are denying the opportunity for education for many of the sons and daughters. Mr. President, I want to just point out that a $250 increase in the cost of college will cause roughly 20,000 fewer students from working families to enroll. Because there are almost $1,000 in additional costs to working families just in the grace-period provisions of the Republican proposal, 80,000 young people in this country will not go to college because of the increased burden that their families will not be able to pay. Now, there will be a time when someone says, ``This is really a very minor slap on the wrist for these families.'' They will point out, ``Look, you are only talking about $900 for the grace period, only $500 more under the PLUS loans, and only $25 under the institutional loans.'' Mr. President, that all adds up. In my State of Massachusetts, working families will have to pay more than $200 million in additional costs. That is wrong. It is a transfer of wealth from working families to the already wealthy individuals in our country. Therefore, I hope that this amendment is agreed to. It is a responsible amendment. We have debated this issue many times and we have said that we believe that education is fundamental to the future of America and young Americans. Why should we dampen, and in many instances extinguish, the hopes and dreams of the sons and daughters of working families? That is the choice here. We can strike the alternative minimum tax or we can dock the sons and daughters of working families.

And I want to spend this evening talking about one of those issues that is getting less attention than it deserves. I am talking about the fact that in my home State of Maine and all across this country, seniors who need prescription drugs in many cases simply cannot afford to buy them. In my office, my district office in Maine, people are coming in all the time, calling on the phone or stepping into the office and basically saying, What can I possibly do? I can no longer afford my prescription drugs. People who have a Social Security check each month of $800 to $1,200 can wind up with $400, $500 a month in prescription drug costs, and the math just does not work. They cannot do it. People are, in fact, giving up food in order to buy their medicine or giving up their medicine in order to pay the rent or buy food. We have been dealing with this problem for years. Back in 1998 I introduced a bill that would provide a 30 percent discount to all Medicare beneficiaries and the cost of all of their prescription drugs at no significant cost to the Federal Government. But the pharmaceutical industry weighed in, lobbied heavily, described the plan as price controls even though it is one that is widely employed by other industrialized nations and nothing has happened on that front. The Democratic Caucus year after year has proposed a Medicare prescription drug benefit. That is a benefit for Medicare beneficiaries operating in the way that part B of Medicare does, the way doctors, the expenses for physicians is covered, that is, seniors would pay a certain amount per month and get a significant portion of their expenses covered, both by the amount they pay and by contributions from general revenues. Well, that is what we thought ought to appear here. But tonight I want to spend some time talking about what really goes on here in Washington, what really goes on out in the field, and why we do not have even a discount for Medicare beneficiaries or a Medicare benefit. And we may remember, it has been a long time, but some may remember in one of the debates, one of the Presidential debates in the year 2000, President Bush said, I support a Medicare prescription drug benefit. I knew what he meant. Lots of people in this Congress knew what he meant. But never in the past 2 years has the administration presented a plan for a Medicare prescription drug benefit. Not one. Let us look at a little bit of what has been going on in the Congress and why we have not been able to accomplish what we should. Let us look for a moment at the last election cycle, 1999 to 2000. The pharmaceutical industry in that time period, according to the consumer watchdog group Public Citizen, spent $177 million lobbying Members of Congress and $20 million in campaign contributions. So that is $200 million that the pharmaceutical industry spent in those 2 years in order to try to get its way. At the same time they employed in the year 2000, 625 lobbyists here in Washington. Think about it. There are only 535 Members of the Senate and the House put together, but the pharmaceutical industry hired 625 lobbyists to make sure that their views were well represented in the Congress. But that is not the end of the story. In the same time period, that election cycle, the pharmaceutical industry was the largest interest group spending money on political ads, so-called issue ads, of any group in the country. They spent $50 million. And we can be sure, we can be sure based on their advertising so far in this cycle that they will far exceed that number. Let us take a look at how these groups operate. The pharmaceutical industry not only has legions of professional lobbyists, but it is also funding what they call grass roots groups. A lot of us call this Astroturf lobbying because the grass is manufactured. And I want to call attention to a couple of those groups. One group is the 60 Plus Association, which not so long ago did an ad in the Houston Chronicle, an ad thanking the majority whip, the gentleman from Texas , for his work on a prescription drug benefit plan. And the advertisement of the 60 Plus Association, we need to know, is funded by the pharmaceutical industry. It sounds like a group just of grass roots seniors, but it is not. It is funded by the pharmaceutical industry. Here is what the ad said. It said: ``Results, not politics, for American seniors.'' And it goes on and on talking about this particular publication. What we need to know, what people need to know about this industry and this campaign, Mr. Speaker, is that 2 days after the House Republicans unveiled their prescription drug plan back in June, a plan that was backed by the pharmaceutical industry, pharmaceutical companies were among 21 donors paying $250,000 each for special treatment at a GOP fund-raising gala headed by President Bush. That same week, a senior House Republican leadership aide was quoted in the newspaper as saying that Republicans are ``working hard behind the scenes on behalf of PHARMA,'' the industry association, ``to make sure that the party's prescription drug plan for the elderly suits drug companies.''. In fact, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce during markup of the Republican prescription drug bill had to break early that day so that Republican law makers could attend the dinner, and that was reported in the Washington Post on June 19, 2002. At that time, the drug lobby had financed a massive $4.6 million issue ad campaign in 18 competitive districts, some of them held by Republicans. This September one ad in the Houston Chronicle praising the gentleman from Texas for the plan he supports is really a remarkable document. The pharmaceutical industry wrote the bill, wrote the Republican prescription drug bill. It passed by a very narrow majority on essentially a party line vote, and now the pharmaceutical industry goes out running ads thanking the Republicans for passing the bill that the pharmaceutical industry wrote. If people have enough money in this country, they can do a lot to hoodwink the American people. Let us take a look at this particular ad and just talk about some of the allegations made here. The suggestion is that the Republican prescription drug plan includes a guaranteed drug benefit under Medicare for all seniors, but what the ad does not tell us is that it does not provide a guaranteed defined benefit with a guaranteed premium, and the reason for that is that the plan relied on insurance companies to provide the benefit. It was not a Medicare benefit. It was an Aetna benefit, a CIGNA benefit, a United benefit. It was something, but it was not a benefit, and we can look through that entire bill and look for the number that seniors will have to pay to be part this so- called Medicare prescription drug benefit plan and we cannot find the number anywhere in the bill because it does not exist, because what the bill consists of is a subsidy to insurance companies in the hope that they will turn around and provide stand-alone prescription drug insurance to seniors, a kind of policy that does not exist at all today and probably will never exist but which is the heart and soul, if those are the words, of the Republican bill. Let me deal with the other four allegations here. The suggestion is that this will reduce out-of-pocket costs by up to 70 percent, but what the ad does not tell us is that those seniors with drug costs between $2,000 and $3,700, within that group, will have to pay 100 percent out- of-pocket if the insurance companies, given the subsidy, offer the plan that is assumed by the Republican prescription drug bill, all of which is highly unlikely. The third claim is that this plan, the Republican plan, would offer seniors the flexibility to choose the plan that best meets their need, but what the ad does not say is that the plans under the Republican prescription drug bill are not under the Medicare program but private insurance companies and HMOs, and as someone who comes from the State of Maine, it is very clear to me that Maine, another rural State, is going to be one of the last places where insurance companies rush in and say we really want to provide prescription drug insurance to seniors, a group that represents 12 percent of the population but buys 33 percent of all prescription medications. Then the fourth claim in this ad run by the astroturf organization in favor of the pharmaceutical industry is that it will provide complete protection against catastrophic drug costs, but it does not say that between $2,000 and $3,700 a person pays 100 percent out of pocket, and the catastrophic protection assumes that again there will be an insurance company to provide the benefit. The final claim here is that there is no government bureaucrat between a person and their doctor, but there is someone between them and their doctor, and that will be the private insurance company, the HMO who will decide what drugs will be available under what plans. One of the problems with that is, unlike Medicare, where the benefits are reasonably stable, known in advance, consistent from year to year, where the premium changes only a slight difference from year to year, when it comes to HMOs and private insurance companies, what will happen, as it has in the Medicare+Choice market, is every year people will be laid off if the company is not making money in a particular area. The premium can be changed, the benefits can be changed at will, and despite the fact that in each of the last 4 or 5 years hundreds of thousands of people each year for a total of several million have withdrawn from the Medicare+Choice plans, that is, managed care for Medicare beneficiaries, despite that fact, that is the model that is being relied on under the Republican prescripti","word.count":1863,"sep11":1.04494382022472,"years":2002.90449438202,"days":2814,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.157604513847741,"Topic 2":0.0379664219810466,"Topic 3":0.158733036724652,"Topic 4":0.588946302802407,"Topic 5":0.00565331578952015,"Topic 6":0.00550661690549149,"Topic 7":0.0095967485330871,"Topic 8":0.0182028977821572,"Topic 9":0.0100173104392646,"Topic 10":0.00777283519463255},{"id":"10419950126690","body":"Jesse Helms: Mr. President, the impression will not go away: The $4.9 trillion Federal debt stands today as a sort of grotesque parallel to television's energizer bunny that appears and appears and appears in precisely the same way that the Federal debt keeps going up and up and up.

I happen to have a lot of respect for my colleague from New York, and he has the guts to really stand up and say that one of the reasons he is voting against some of these judges is the question of ideology. I think he is dead wrong on that, but the fact is, I respect him for at least being upfront and stating what he believes. He has also said we need to have balance on the courts. I am not so sure that is a bad concept, but I believe whoever is President, we have to have that President's choice of judges. That is one thing we do when we elect a President. Unless you can find some really valid reason for voting against these judges, that I think has to be more than ideology--at least that is my view--then you should vote for those judges, which is a practice I have followed throughout the Clinton administration and throughout the Carter administration, as a matter of fact. I think it is the correct practice. I still respect my colleague for his beliefs, for his forthright statements. I want to correct the record on a few things. No. 1, with regard to balance, there is a lack of balance in many circuit courts of appeals today one way or the other. In the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, 17 of the 23 judges are Democrats; 14 were appointed by none other than President William Jefferson Clinton. In the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, the majority of them are Democrats. These are two very important circuit courts. In the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, it could very easily have been that way. It comes down to whoever is President. That is one of the things we do when we choose a President: We choose the person who is going to pick the judges for the next 4 years. And I believe, unless you have a legitimate reason--and it has to be a very legitimate reason for opposing those judges--you need to vote for them. I heard the distinguished Senator from Vermont tonight say Judge Smith rules too much for corporations. Give me a break. He has been on the bench 14 years. He has ruled for everybody during those 14 years. And, by the way, occasionally corporations are right. And if they are right, as judges in this country they ought to rule in their favor if it is a nonjury trial. They ought to be fair in their instructions if it is a jury trial and in the conduct of the trial if it is a jury trial. Brooks Smith has had that type of reputation. With regard to another comment of my friend from New York, he continues to repeat a myth that arose out of the Clarence Thomas proceedings. I happened to be there during those Clarence Thomas proceedings, and that myth is that he said he never discussed Roe v. Wade. That is not what he said. He was asked directly, and he said: I never debated it with my philosophy classmates. That is a considerably different answer. And from that, they extrapolated he never discussed it, and he wasn't asked any further questions about it by the same person who asked that question. The fact of the matter is, some ideologically disagree with Justice Thomas. Many on our side disagree with Justice Thurgood Marshall. I happened to have respected him greatly. I didn't agree with a lot of the things he wrote, but I also respected him. Clarence Thomas is writing some of the most literate, intelligent decisions on the Supreme Court right now. Let me say the danger of the position of my friend from New York, in saying ideology counts, is: Whose ideology? Because I have seen some very conservative judges get on the bench and become very liberal judges almost overnight. I have seen some very liberal judges get on the bench and become very conservative judges--maybe not overnight but certainly in time. I have to ask you, if you start talking ideology, whose ideology? There are differences on the Democratic side on ideology. There are differences on the Republican side on ideology. Are we going to have a single litmus test to bar somebody from serving just because they may be against Roe v. Wade or may be pro-life? Are we going to have a litmus test against somebody serving because they once participated as a corporate lawyer? A terrible thing to do, I guess. No, we should not do that. If we took that attitude, that Roe v. Wade is paramount and preeminent in all judicial considerations, there would have been very few Clinton judges. As I say, he came very close, virtually was the same as the all-time confirmation champion, Ronald Reagan. So that is the danger, in my belief and in my philosophy, of the position of the distinguished Senator from New York. I respect the position. I respect his openness. I respect his forthrightness. I respect him personally. He is very intelligent, a good lawyer--some would say a great lawyer. I would say that. I enjoy being with him on the Judiciary Committee. But his doctrine is a dangerous doctrine because--whose ideology? People have tried to stereotype me the whole time I have been in the Senate. I just got finished writing a book that will be published this fall. It is going to be called ``The Square Peg.'' Guess who the square peg is. The fact is, that book is going to show I don't particularly fit in any category. Neither does the Senator from New York. In some respects, he is a very conservative Senator. In other respects, he is very liberal. I have had the same thing said about me. Does that mean neither of us could serve on any court because we might be conservative on some issues, we might be liberal on other issues, that offend some in this body? No, it should not mean that. Look, if a person is out of the mainstream, that is another matter. But I have seen the argument come up time after time the judges are outside of the judicial mainstream. That is pure bunk, to be honest with you. They do not get through this process where they are nominated by any President of the United States by being outside of the mainstream. They just do not. Some are conservative and some are liberal. This President has nominated some very liberal judges. He has nominated some very good conservative judges. He has nominated people in between. He has nominated Democrats. He has nominated Republicans. But it is dangerous to say that anybody's personal ideology ought to determine whether a person serves on the bench if that person is otherwise qualified. I hope my colleague who is forced to sit there and listen to me at this time as the Presiding Officer will reconsider at least some aspects of his position because he may be chairman of the Judiciary Committee someday. When he is, he is going to find that in the interest of fairness, you have to presume and give the benefit of the doubt to the President's nominee, especially unless you can show that they are outside of the mainstream of American jurisprudence. I have to tell you that I haven't seen many--in my whole time in 26 years in the Senate and confirming almost every judge that currently sits on the Federal bench--that I would consider coming close to being outside of the mainstream of American jurisprudence. By the time they get through the vetting process at the White House, the vetting process of the FBI, the vetting process of the American Bar Association, and when they wind up with a well-qualified rating from the American Bar Association, you can't say they are outside of the mainstream of American jurisprudence, nor can you say that because they differ with you ideologically you have to vote against them. I happen to love my colleague. I just hope he will reconsider because I don't want him leading those who are less mentally equipped down the primrose path of partisan politics. I yield the floor to my dear colleague and friend from Florida, who has really fought that good battle on S. 812, which is something I very much respect.","word.count":1425,"sep11":0.904494382022472,"years":2002.76404494382,"days":2764,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.00735027916183823,"Topic 2":0.0993089002333011,"Topic 3":0.0359897087409733,"Topic 4":0.00563747902308894,"Topic 5":0.019362287160829,"Topic 6":0.00477452928279781,"Topic 7":0.00489362061294761,"Topic 8":0.274546436802511,"Topic 9":0.533975245347724,"Topic 10":0.0141615136339899},{"id":"10519980072228","body":"Dick Durbin: So, in other words, I recall a gentleman I worked for in Illinois by the name of Cecil Partee, who used to say, ``In politics, for every position you take there is a good reason and a real reason.''

Con. Res 353, the FY 2003 Congressional Budget Resolution. The budget resolution is fiscally irresponsible. It spends more than 86 percent of the Social Security surplus and uses up the entire Medicare surplus. There are only six years left before the baby-boom generation begins to retire, and now is not the time to deplete the Social Security and Medicare surpluses. Over the past eight years we have had budgets culminating in real debt reduction, and a growing surplus that did not rely on Social Security or Medicare. The budget resolution before us today, quickly creates an on-budget deficit of $974 billion over five years according to the Congressional Budget Office. The tragic attacks on September 11, 2001, the short and shallow recession, and the continuing war on terrorism taken all together did not precipitate the budget deficit. Mr. Chairman, while I support the war on terrorism, and increased homeland security, I did not support the irresponsible tax cut passed last year. The fact is, it consumed approximately 43 percent of the budget surplus and led to our current poor fiscal health. This budget does not lead to debt reduction or Social Security and Medicare solvency and it does not ensure that our other national priorities are met. Last year, the leadership went down the primrose path by enacting a tax cut that cost our country nearly 2 trillion dollars. But before this year is out we must get the budget back on track. Further, for the first time in years, the budget resolution is only a five-year budget instead of a ten-year budget. It remains in deficit throughout the next five years, which leaves us to infer the damage that will result in the second five years. In effect, this budget cloaks the large amount of Social Security and Medicare surpluses that will be spent after FY2007 and it allows the Leadership to avoid deciding whether to sustain the sunset provision of the tax cut passed last spring or extend the tax cuts at an additional cost. This lack of a ten-year plan leads me to believe that either the House Leadership has no long-term plan of recovery or they have a plan that will not stand scrutiny under the public eye. Regardless, this resolution offers no targets, no objectives, and no strategies to return to budget surpluses. In addition, this budget resolution attempts to make the deficit appear smaller by authorizing non-defense, and non-homeland security discretionary spending at almost five percent below the level necessary to maintain current levels of services. Perhaps, even more disappointing, the resolution cuts funding for the bipartisan No Child Left Behind Act recently signed into law, as well as other cuts in education, health care, and environmental protection. Mr. Chairman, I am saddened that we are being forced to vote on this irresponsible budget resolution without any opportunity to create a bipartisan fiscally responsible budget. As Members of this great institution, we often deliberate important issues that effect our own and our children's futures. During debates of this nature, I frequently ask myself one simple question; will the vote I am about to cast make the nation and our society better and safer for my two sons, Johnny and Matt, as they live, learn and grow in the 21st Century. For once, lets put their future first, ahead of Washington politics. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose the budget resolution for the fiscal year 2003.","word.count":582,"sep11":0.533707865168539,"years":2002.39325842697,"days":2632,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0601264280127302,"Topic 2":0.11093885784627,"Topic 3":0.0492268789023783,"Topic 4":0.351477018597271,"Topic 5":0.02368306141609,"Topic 6":0.00810507162970621,"Topic 7":0.14863988053023,"Topic 8":0.0201679564853296,"Topic 9":0.162918630257126,"Topic 10":0.0647162163228693},{"id":"10619990046234","body":"Chuck Robb: Mr. President, I thank Senator Kennedy for his leadership on this and all of the issues that relate to education that we deal with in the Senate. I commend him particularly for this amendment that deals with teacher quality and recruiting and training the people who go into the teaching profession. I think it is clear from the experience in my State--that is the experience that I come from and understand a little bit, at least--that we have too few funds available for the training of teachers, people who are already in the workforce who need additional training, and people who are going into teaching. Clearly the Federal funds made available for that purpose meet a real need. Despite the fact a lot of money is spent on education nationally--I certainly concede a lot is-- there are other pressures on local school boards. There are other pressures on States that tend to result in too little of the money going to train the teachers and going to upgrade their skill levels. This amendment would ensure that at least a portion of the Federal funds we are providing to States for education go to this vital activity. I think the amendment is absolutely crucial. I hope every Senator will vote for it. When you look at all the factors that affect education, I think there are many studies which have concluded correctly that the factor, if you have to pick one, that is most significant in determining the quality of a child's education is the quality of the teacher and the training of that teacher to provide that instruction. This amendment goes directly to that. It says we need to keep our priorities straight when we spend public money. We need to be sure the funds go to what is most important in terms of improving the education of the children involved. That means training the teachers. I compliment Senator Kennedy very much for this amendment. I am very pleased to speak for it, and am very pleased to support it. I think this goes to the heart of what we are trying to do. It goes to the heart of the concern I hear all over my State from a lot of people about the inadequacies of our educational system. We have a sad circumstance in my State. I have encountered something which we call a ``permanent substitute.'' I go to school districts and they say: OK, you are trying to ensure that more of the accredited teachers are actually accredited to teach in the subjects they are teaching. That is not our problem. Our problem is we have people teaching on a semipermanent basis in our classrooms, and we call them ``permanent substitutes.'' They not only are not qualified in the subject area they are being asked to teach, but they are not really qualified to be teaching. They haven't been accredited. This is a sad commentary. You have to go through licensing procedures to be a hairdresser in our State. You have to go through licensing procedures to pursue virtually any career. We need to be sure we impose accountability on the teaching of professionals as well. Teachers themselves want to see this happen. This is not an antiteacher proposal. This is something teachers themselves want to see more funds available for in training and upgrading their skills. This is an amendment I strongly support. I commend Senator Kennedy for proposing this amendment. I hope all Senators will review it carefully and will determine to support the amendment when it comes up for a vote.

We are here to speak about, why is it that the world is not doing more to stop the Sudanese Government troops and their allied military, the Janjaweed? Together, they have raped, tortured, maimed and burned entire villages to cleanse the area of African Muslims resulting in close to 50,000 deaths. Another 1.5 million persons have been forced from their homes into camps where they remain vulnerable to attacks by the Janjaweed, who are among the police guarding the camps. The world cannot continue to condone this genocide. We can also not continue to condone the presence of human rights abusers on a commission that is charged with protecting human rights because it is ridiculous and unconscionable to think that the very perpetrator of a genocide could also be the enforcer of human rights. But that is exactly what is happening by allowing Sudan to continue to serve on the United Nations Human Rights Commission. That is why I stand behind this bill to suspend the Sudan from the U.N. Commission on Human Rights and for the U.N. to launch a formal inquiry into its acts of genocide in Sudan. Let us hope the world will begin to work harder to end the atrocities by, first, suspending Sudan from a commission it fails to respect, and second, by standing behind the efforts of the African Union to stop these atrocities. We are here today to simply speak about why it is that the world is not doing more to stop Sudanese government troops and their allied militia, the Janjaweed. Together they have raped, tortured, maimed, and burned entire villages to cleanse African Muslims from the area-- resulting in close to 50,000 deaths. Another 1.5 million persons have been forced from their homes and into camps, where they remain vulnerable to attacks by the Janjaweed, who have been hired as police to guard the camps. The world cannot continue to condone this genocide. We can also not continue to condone the presence of human rights abusers on a Commission that is charged with protecting Human Rights. It is simply unconscionable to think that the very perpetrators of genocide could also be the enforcers of human rights. But that is exactly what is happening by allowing Sudan to continue to serve on the United Nations Human Rights Commission. Numerous reports provide evidence of the Sudanese government's involvement in actively committing atrocities in Darfur. However, the Sudanese government continues to deny any connection to the atrocities carried out by the Janjaweed and simultaneously, has done little to stop them. By insisting that no genocide is taking place and repeatedly denying any responsibility for protecting their own people, the Sudanese government has demonstrated that it is not fit to serve on the United Nations Human Rights Commission. What is needed now is action from the international community. First, Sudan's membership on the United Nations Human Rights Commission must be suspended. The universal declaration on human rights states that, ``everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person'' and that no ``state, group or person has any right to engage in any activity or to perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms.'' The Sudanese government, through its involvement in perpetrating the genocide in Darfur, and its inaction in doing anything to resolve the humanitarian crisis, is in violation of the basic principles of the United Nations Human Rights Commission. It, therefore, cannot remain a member. Second, the international community must offer increased support to the African Union, which has been a leader in attempting to resolve the conflict in Sudan. In addition to leading peace talks, the African Union has led a small contingency of troops to Darfur to monitor the cease-fire and serve as observers. The African Union must be congratulated on these efforts. Additionally, support for their efforts must be increased. It is essential that the African Union's force be enlarged and allotted a robust mandate to protect Darfur's civilians from new attacks. We can no longer sit on the sidelines and pretend that nothing is going on while the Sudanese government commits crime after crime against humanity. Murder, rape, forced displacement--these are clearly not the tools of human rights supporters. That is why I stand behind this bill to suspend Sudan from the U.N. Commission on Human Rights and for the U.N. to launch a formal inquiry into the acts of genocide in Sudan.","word.count":781,"sep11":3.10955056179775,"years":2004.9691011236,"days":3549,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.797146139081125,"Topic 2":0.0697911266312188,"Topic 3":0.0143524853848028,"Topic 4":0.0297789233718954,"Topic 5":0.014870908119218,"Topic 6":0.014909319167638,"Topic 7":0.0125684300284429,"Topic 8":0.0246737632737701,"Topic 9":0.0155742326369889,"Topic 10":0.00633467230490019},{"id":"10419950000647","body":"Rosa L.

One major investment bank failed. Another is filing for bankruptcy. As we know, Bear Stearns was propped up because of Government money. Lehman Brothers is being purchased by another bank. It is hard to comprehend that Bear Stearns is no longer what it was. Lehman Brothers is, in effect, gone. The name may be saved, but that may be all. We have other companies that we are watching very closely. One of the companies was saved by a competitor, and the Federal Reserve is now saying they must liberalize access to its discount window. By all accounts, this was a remarkable turn of events for Wall Street, our Nation's financial markets, and the world's financial markets. When all the smoke of these major financial shakeups has cleared--and we don't know when that will be--our job remains the same as always; that is, the Members of Congress, to do everything we can to help the American people make it through these trying times. What we are seeing on Wall Street today is yet more fallout from the Bush and now McCain economic policies that have failed our country. The Bush administration failed to police lenders and neglected to protect consumers. That led to the subprime crisis and cost millions of American families their homes and continues to wreak havoc on neighborhoods and financial institutions throughout America. This Bush- McCain ``anything goes'' approach, which the Bush administration has called free market economics but has amounted to nothing more than willful neglect for American families, has resulted in, I repeat, millions of lost jobs, millions of lost homes, with an enormous price tag for the American taxpayer to accompany that. If there ever was a reminder of our country's desperate need for new economic leadership, what more do we need? This is it. Today, Monday, with what happened around the financial markets to our great country, with all the bad news today, Senator John McCain said the fundamentals of our economy are strong. Think about that. I don't know what that means. I don't know if anyone knows what that means. For whom is the economy strong? It is not strong for homeowners in Nevada. It is certainly not strong for homeowners in Florida, Arizona, California, and most every other place in America. It is not strong for wage earners who are spending more of their paychecks than ever to buy gas to get to work, and then they have to come home at day's end. School districts are having a difficult time because busing is now an integral part of a school district. Trucking companies are in desperate shape, all because of the high price of fuel. It is not just middle-class families that are saving less and spending more on groceries, clothing, and health care; it is throughout our society. The economy certainly isn't strong for the 606,000 Americans who lost their jobs this year. This is 606,000 people, and you have John McCain saying the economy looks good. I really don't understand what he means, that the fundamentals are good. The economy is not strong for fixed-income seniors, which the Presiding Officer's State of Florida has more than any other place in the union. Certainly, in Nevada, we are the most rapidly growing senior population. It is not strong for them or especially for those in the Northeast because they have so much heating done with fuel oil. The prices will go up by at least 50 percent--some say 75 percent--this year. There may be places in America where the economy is strong, such as country clubs and boardrooms at firms that haven't folded. For the rest of America, this economy is not strong. It will not solve itself, no matter what President Bush and John McCain say. Fixing this mess will take real leadership and a change of direction. During this work period, I hope Congress will show some leadership, with some direction from the President, which we don't have, by passing another economic stimulus plan that creates jobs and invests in our economy. We have a lot to do in the next 2 weeks. That is all we have left until the due date for us to leave here. I hope we can leave here, but I don't know that we can. Everybody should understand that we may do the unthinkable and have to have votes here on Friday and maybe even on Monday. We have to get essential work done. The Defense authorization bill--we need to complete that legislation. There will be no rollcall votes on this today. The managers have worked most of Thursday and Friday. Of course, today they are available and have been available to come up with an agreement on amendments before the cloture vote on the bill. If the managers of the bill don't get an agreement on how to move forward with amendments, we will have a cloture vote in the morning. We have no choice. Senators have until 4 o'clock today to file first-degree amendments to the bill. This Defense authorization bill is an important piece of legislation. I don't know how else to phrase its importance. We know the security of our Nation depends on things other than this Defense authorization bill. We know we are importing 70 percent of our oil. That is important to the security of our country. For a basic understanding of how to treat our military, this bill is it. These two experienced legislators have worked together for decades on this committee. They have put forward some extremely important issues, including the pay raise for the troops and so many other things, to maintain the integrity of our military. Not to pass a Defense bill--how can we leave here and not do that? There are 51 Democratic Senators, and every one of them will vote for this legislation. We need help from the other side. Now, did everyone have the opportunity to offer all of the amendments they wanted? The answer is yes. Did they get a chance to vote on them? No, but that is not our fault or the managers' fault. I hope unanimous consent can be reached on a list of amendments and that we will dispose of those as quickly as we can. This would allow Senators to have their voices heard, which could perhaps allow us to pass this without another Republican filibuster. We are probably at about 95 filibusters now, Mr. President. Once we complete this bill, then we are going to have to move to our energy legislation--first of all, the tax extenders. That is so important. We have an economy that we have talked about a little bit today, about how very shaky it is. If we extend the tax credits for renewable energy, we would create hundreds of thousands of jobs. These are not just jobs where the Sun shines a lot; these are jobs everywhere in America. In my little hometown of Searchlight, NV, renewable energy has hit there. There is a company that is going to put in windmills there. It takes a while, with environmental impact statements, but they have gotten permission in the Federal agencies to do this. That would happen all over America today. But what has happened is that people who have these projects are backing out of them because they don't have the tax credits. You cannot have people investing huge amounts of money for a tax credit of 1 year or 6 months, and the legislation that will be brought before the body will have multiyear, long-term tax credits. That is what we need. That is going to happen. We have worked out an arrangement with the Finance Committee, as I understand it, that it will all be paid for, which I think will be acceptable to both Democrats and Republicans. Then we are going to have to do the other tax extenders, with AMT and other problems. We cannot pay for all that. I certainly cannot tell the House of Representatives how to do business, and they don't tell us how to do ours, but I hope they will allow this vote on what we are going to send them. The Presiding Officer and this Senator from Nevada served in the House of Representatives. When we served there, the leaders we had there never, ever tried to pass legislation just with Democrats, even though we had a significant majority when we served in the House. We always looked to Tip O'Neill and Jim Wright, who were our leaders, and they would go to the Republicans and try to get enough votes to pass it. I hope we can do it. This is passable. We need to do this on the tax credits and tax extenders. Mr. President, I have expressed to everybody, and I say it here today, that even though I don't think there is going to be immediate relief from drilling, we are going to have some drilling votes here. It is the consensus of the American people, and both Democrats and Republicans, that we should have some drilling votes. We are going to do that. Senator Bingaman came up with a proposal that he worked on for weeks. We will do that, and then we will move to what the Republicans want. We will vote on that, and then we are going to have the bipartisan proposal of the Gang of 10. In the meantime, we will get from the House, I think, a bill they will pass over there dealing with energy. As I understand it, it won't have any of the tax extenders on it, but it will have a number of important issues to people over here. Then there are a lot of things we need to deal with, which I have talked about briefly. I hope we can get direction from the President. We can call it a stimulus bill, supplemental appropriations, emergency funding--call it whatever you want, but we have real problems out there in our country that deserve Federal attention. We hope we can get something done there. Then we have the continuing resolution we have to do so we can fund the Government. I can only speak for myself and my counterpart, Senator McConnell, will have to speak for himself, but I think it is our initial hope that we can fund the Government until sometime in February. But if not, then we will have to come back here for a lame- duck session. But we have to fund the Government.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Menendez substitute because I believe that its provisions, like those in the Shays-Maloney bill, better reflect the recommendations contained in the bipartisan 9/11 Commission Report: To improve our intelligence gathering and analytical capabilities and create ``an enhanced system of checks and balances'' to adequately protect civil liberties. I regret, however, that the options before us today fail to fully embrace available technologies to modernize our driver's license and identification systems. Some States are taking action, for example, as some of my colleagues may have read in today's Washington Times and Washington Post; a plan to use embedded chip technology is currently under consideration in the Virginia legislature. Still, the pace of change remains slow and problems in our driver's license system persist. The holes in our system continue to support a thriving black market for fake IDs, create security risks that are national in scope, and therefore warrant adequate Federal resources to repair. The September 11th hijackings illuminated many holes in our domestic security, for example 13 of the 19 hijackers were able to obtain driver's licenses or ID cards, some from black market ``brokers'' who often charge $2,000 for a single fake license. Utilizing chip technology and biometric identifiers will make a quantum leap in the efficiency of the system and make it significantly harder for criminals and terrorists to obtain fake licenses. Unfortunately, neither side of the aisle took full advantage of this opportunity to utilize on-card biometric technology to repair holes in the system. In light of the currently available technologies, the bills being considered on the House floor today simply do not go far enough. The on-card biometric technology we need to adopt in our driver's license system is not entirely new. Private companies and government agencies currently utilize embedded chips in their ID cards. The smart cards have been in use for years in the military with the Common Access Card, or CAC, and Congress sanctioned the use of on-card biometric technology in the US-VISIT visa program. Both the 9/11 Commission Report and its predecessor, the Markle Foundation Task Force Report, hailed on-card biometrics as an excellent example of how technology can be used to improve the integrity of a number of identification documents. Why not use it on our driver's licenses? The legislative solution I have proposed retains traditional State authority over non-commercial driver's licenses, but recognizes that disparate standards, outmoded technologies and inadequate security features create risks that are national in scope and therefore justify Federal resources and technical assistance. Many states are open to adopting the technology, but they need Federal assistance to implement it. Mr. Chairman, we must not delay any further. The time to act has come. A driver's license is a dangerous tool in the hands of a criminal, or worse, a terrorist. It allows them to easily travel on our roads, open bank accounts, rent vehicles, and take domestic flights. The driver's license has come to represent more than authorization to operate a motor vehicle; it imparts a stamp of legitimacy and is often taken as unquestionable proof of identity. Possession of a driver's license allows terrorists to easily travel and blend into the population. Of course there are many out there who fear new uses of technology. Civil libertarians, conspiracy theorists and absolutists will attempt to characterize smart cards as a threat to individual privacy. In fact the opposite is true. By reducing identity theft , controlling access to personal data through encryption and proper regulations, and making it easier to create a digital paper trail on government employees who access your data, smart cards will actually reduce privacy violations. Smart cards will not allow the government to track people's movements; the chips don't work that way. The best government could do in tracking your movements is maintain records of where and when you are asked to show your license, something it already does by writing down your driver's license number. Of course it is difficult to completely allay the concerns of civil libertarians and privacy advocates, lest we do away with all forms of identification. But smart cards will not create invasion of privacy risks that do not already exist today. They will, however, significantly reduce the risk of identity theft, and correct current widespread abuses in the system. As an added benefit, the technology will make it easier for law enforcement officials to do their job by eliminating wasted time filling out paperwork, but it will not magically transform every law enforcement officer or civil servant into a voyeur or jackbooted thug bent on harassing you at every turn. Mr. Chairman, I urge this Congress to take the next logical step and implement smart card and biometric technology in driver's licenses and ID cards. I look forward to working with relevant committees in advancing this important policy. In light of the serious problems that persist, we can't afford delay.","word.count":115,"sep11":2.14606741573034,"years":2004.00561797753,"days":3206,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.00685563869696894,"Topic 2":0.0294396113523388,"Topic 3":0.00294495415300565,"Topic 4":0.00734103067759137,"Topic 5":0.00159056392103252,"Topic 6":0.00284534482192788,"Topic 7":0.0395464656939557,"Topic 8":0.0119881037216997,"Topic 9":0.894145792703826,"Topic 10":0.00330249425765397},{"id":"10820030009350","body":"Rick Boucher: What is interesting, too, Mr. Speaker, is that those who have stepped back from the fray, some of the Arab nations, like Saudi Arabia, have now discovered that they are targets; that you cannot, by staying away from this fight that the Americans have taken on, because we face our threats head on and take them on, they thought somehow they could stay out of the battle and they could stay away from the brutality of the terrorist groups. But they have discovered now they cannot do that. Jordan is discovering it cannot avoid this conflict. And I think there is another thing, too, that the world understands, and perhaps more leaders in the world need to be educated on this. We won World War II. We could have enslaved Germany and Japan. And certainly after what Japan did to us with the surprise attack at Pearl Harbor, the Japanese people were told by their military leaders to expect us to be as brutal to them as they had been to other people. They decapitated our POWs. They killed about a third of them. They killed 100,000 people when they took Nan-King, China. They speared live people on their bayonet courses. They captured Chinese civilians. They did all these brutal, horrible things, and they warned their people, they are now going to do to us what we have done to them. But American GIs walked down the streets of Tokyo and handed out Hershey bars. That character has not changed. When we look at the guys walking down the streets of Baghdad with a bunch of kids standing around them, we see the same character. In fact, many of those guys are the grandchildren of people who served in World War II and the children of people who served in Vietnam. That takes me to one thing, too, that I thought was very relevant, and that is the fight over the Presidency and Senator Kerry's participation in the Vietnam War, for which he should be credited, but also the accountability that he should take for what he said about his fellow GIs. If we were to take three of the statements Senator Kerry has said, the one where he said 80 percent of us were stoned on dope 24 hours a day; the one where he said that we murdered 200,000 people, that was two of those statements; and the one where he said that we ravaged the countryside, cutting off limbs and murdering people in a manner, quote, reminiscent of Ghengis Khan, if Senator Kerry had said that our GIs in Iraq, as they were driving up that country, if he had come on television and said the American soldiers in Iraq are stoned 24 hours a day, 80 percent of them; that they have murdered 200,000 Iraqis, and they are ravaging Iraq in a manner reminiscent of Ghengis Khan, the American people would be picketing his office by the tens of thousands, and he would be on his way out immediately. So if we just juxtapose and take off that word Vietnam from the statement he made in 1971, where he said American GIs were ravaging Vietnam like Ghengis Khan and had murdered 200,000 people, if we took out Vietnam and put Iraq on it, I think Americans today can understand why a lot of Vietnam veterans feel no close kinship to Senator Kerry. Because those guys that were driving up there through the heart of Iraq taking that shot and shell and heading for Baghdad, those kids were the same guys we had in Vietnam. Many of them were the sons and grandsons. Same character, same characteristics, same sense of honor, and doing the same great thing for the people. Lastly, I remember the pictures of the people, of all the hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese who tried to swim after the Americans after we left Vietnam. I remember also the pictures of the people being held in the Hong Kong camps who were now going to be forcibly repatriated back to what I guess Mr. Kerry's cohorts would call the people's working paradise in Vietnam. They were holding on to the guards and they were shrieking and they were beside themselves. They would do anything and had to be sedated to be finally put on the planes to be carried back to Communist Vietnam. That showed, to a large degree, the character of the Americans that had been in Vietnam. If we had been bad to the people, they would not have tried to swim after us after we left. And they are today in our populations by the hundreds of thousands. So I thought about that when I watched that embedded news following our kids in the 1st Marine Division in Iraq and following the 101st Airborne and the 3rd Army and the 4th Infantry Division. Same people, same GIs, same good people.","word.count":301,"sep11":1.61797752808989,"years":2003.47752808989,"days":3018,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.683048000892837,"Topic 2":0.240313369330343,"Topic 3":0.00530667146274811,"Topic 4":0.00770977162686599,"Topic 5":0.00777816055554492,"Topic 6":0.0233921079294583,"Topic 7":0.0142232087580175,"Topic 8":0.0102869810457247,"Topic 9":0.00581317235897063,"Topic 10":0.00212855603949007},{"id":"10920050002234","body":"Kendrick Meek: Madam Speaker, let me follow up on what my friend from Ohio just said.

That debate and that discussion revolves around the issue of immigration and immigration reform, and it has many, many implications for who we are as a Nation, where we go from here, and how successful we may be in trying to achieve whatever goals we establish for ourselves. It is connected to an even more significant challenge to the United States, and that is the reestablishment of the idea of exactly who we are, of what we are, what principles we espouse as a Nation, of what principles we can adhere to as a people. This part of the debate is an extremely important one, hard to bring up, hard to articulate. Certainly it is impossible to do so in a bumper-sticker fashion. It does require some degree of analysis that goes beyond the 30-second or 60-second sound bite, but I believe it to be a very important debate and discussion to undertake. If we are to believe the polls that have been taken for the last decade or more on the issue of immigration, Americans generally believe that, number one, we should, in fact, enforce the law against people coming here illegally. That means enforcing our borders, making sure to the extent possible that people do not come into this country without our permission, people do not come here that we do not know about, and that we make people come into this country through a normalized and legal process. The United States of America is unique in many ways. One way is that we accept more people into this country every single year legally, through a legal process of immigration and also temporary visitor status, than any country in the world. We are and have been always a beacon of light to the world, a beacon to which many people are attracted. It is peculiar, to say the least, that even with this policy, this very liberal policy of immigration and legal access into our country through temporary worker status, we still have and allow for millions of people to enter this country illegally. We do not know who they are. We do not know why they are coming. We do not know how long they are staying, and we do not know where they are once they are here. Now, most Americans will say this is a bad policy to pursue, that it is not good for America, it is not good for our future, and that we should establish the concept of the nation-state and defend that concept with essentially defending our borders. Beyond that many people suggest, a majority of Americans even suggest we need to reduce legal immigration until such time we can get this problem under control. Every poll says that is what America wants. Now, a dilemma is then created by the fact that this is the will of the people, and it has been for a long, long time. It is not new; it did not just happen after President Reagan said he wanted a guest worker/ amnesty program and that created quite a furor. It has been the case for years that that is what the American people want. They want borders enforced, they want controls on immigration, and yet this body and more peculiarly, even cities and States throughout the Nation, which one would think would be more reflective of local citizen input than even the Congress of the United States, which we know has always been historically way behind the curve in terms of popular sentiment, but one would think that we would see reflected in city councils and State legislatures, one would think we would see far more of a reflection of the position that I have just described that is held by a majority of people in the country. The most difficult question we have to answer, why is that the case? Why do our elected officials seem to be paying little attention to what most Americans feel? There are a number of answers to that question. They are not necessarily pleasant to discuss, but they are true. That is for the most part we see legislatures and the Congress of the United States and even city councils that are very responsive to pressure and pressure groups and less responsive to the general will of the people if it is not reflected through these pressure group-type of organizations. For the most part, politicians in the United States have concluded that they can address this issue by essentially finessing it, by agreeing theoretically with people when they are in an atmosphere, an arena in which doing so would be to their political advantage. They can agree there is a problem with immigration and that we should do something about it and we should stop illegal immigration. Everybody will mouth the platitudes connected to that concept. But they believe also that they can finesse this issue by essentially using the rhetoric to mollify a certain part of their constituency while simultaneously doing things to attract another group; and these are very powerful groups in many ways, certainly very vocal groups which press for open borders, for relaxation of law enforcement, and have a totally different opinion about how this country should actually develop. For the most part, they are trying to serve two masters here. Most politicians are trying to serve two masters, and they have been successful in doing this in many ways because for the most part people in the United States when asked how do they feel about immigration come down on our side, but are not organized in political pressure groups designed to actually force politicians to acknowledging it. They are simply voters and citizens who go to work every single day and have other things on their minds. It is also true that the parties themselves, the Democrats and the Republicans, are both inclined to do exactly what I say that individual politicians do, and that is pander on the one side to immigration, pro- immigration groups, and on the other side placate those people who are concerned about it, placate them through rhetoric, but not through action. They are trying to play this dicey game, and sometimes it works. We have seen throughout the land the development of a very interesting phenomenon whereby foreign countries have used their consular offices in the United States to lobby States and city governments to get them to accept for purposes of identification something called the matricular consular ID card that is given to a person not by the United States of America but by a foreign government. And then that government comes to an American city, county, or State and says please accept the card we give out as proper identification. Now of course Members have to understand that the only reason that the card is necessary is because we have millions and millions of people who are living here illegally. Those are the only folks to whom such a card would be important. If a person is here in this country legally, of course, they have a document which we have given them, a visa, a passport stamp, something that the United States of America has said this allows you to enter our country. Even if you are not here as a citizen, you are a legal alien resident. That is the term. So the only people who need the matricular consular are illegally present in the United States, and everybody knows that. The governments that are pushing it, and the cities and States that are accepting these things know that they are only helpful to people who are here illegally, and they are only helpful if a city or State agrees to accept that card, thereby making it very difficult for people who actually enforce immigration law in this country. Making it very easy, on the other hand, to live here if you are here illegally. You will get all of the benefits of anyone who is here legally. You will be afforded a variety of privileges that have heretofore been allowed only to those people who were citizens of the United States or at least here with the permission of our government. That is happening throughout the country. We have seen it. We have seen cities capitulate. We have actually seen cities, it is bizarre as you can imagine, we have seen cities that actually allow people to vote if they are not legal residents of this country. The Mayor of this city, Washington, D.C., the District, proposed this several months ago for D.C. He said that anybody who is here as a resident should be able to vote regardless of whether or not they are citizens. Again, if we put this up for a vote, a vote of the people, the specific issue to allow people who are here illegally to vote, how many places in America can you imagine that would pass? Maybe in D.C., that is true, but not too many other places in this country would say that is okay; but cities and States are doing it. In the next few days we will be debating a number of appropriations bills, one which will fund the Department of Homeland Security, the Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill. I will offer a series of amendments to that bill. I will tell Members right now those amendments will fail on the House floor. They have done so in the past. That certainly will not stop me from introducing them again. But I suggest, every one of the amendments that I propose, if I proposed them to the American people in the form of some initiative process or some way to let all America vote, I know and certainly all polls tell us they would pass. One, I will propose that no city that has established a sanctuary policy, that is a policy that allows people to come into that city who are here illegally and be protected from the Federal Government's attempts to actually enforce immigration law, where cities that will pass le","word.count":4441,"sep11":2.82865168539326,"years":2004.68820224719,"days":3449,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.11044685392583,"Topic 2":0.0131454914239123,"Topic 3":0.137831867999199,"Topic 4":0.00807157033622001,"Topic 5":0.00838508213507554,"Topic 6":0.161980099190089,"Topic 7":0.00507781856811026,"Topic 8":0.54021815548147,"Topic 9":0.00975005428772529,"Topic 10":0.00509300665236785},{"id":"10720010065703","body":"Kay Bailey Hutchison: Without objection, it is so ordered","word.count":401,"sep11":0.0280898876404494,"years":2001.88764044944,"days":2452,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.885817338699326,"Topic 2":0.0484639762390024,"Topic 3":0.0074788719824153,"Topic 4":0.0158415234575938,"Topic 5":0.00824983766538264,"Topic 6":0.00712997521163013,"Topic 7":0.0056467213857337,"Topic 8":0.0109583305402974,"Topic 9":0.0073260810402071,"Topic 10":0.00308734377841184},{"id":"10720010074370","body":"Larry Craig: Madam President, let me speak for a few moments on the issue of railroad retirement, the stimulus package, and the business before the Senate. Our assistant Republican leader is on the floor and wants to speak to the motion to proceed, so I will be brief. I rise in support of railroad retirement and have been a cosponsor of that legislation for the last several years. There is adequate time to deal with this issue. We can deal with it now following the stimulus package or certainly we can deal with it next year. The Democratic leadership has chosen to bring it up and force the issue at this time. It is an important piece of legislation. There are 75 cosponsors in the Senate. The Senate Finance Committee has worked some on it. The House has worked on it and passed it. Is it a perfect piece of legislation? No. It goes a long way to fix a flawed system, a system at this time that is in deep trouble, a 65- year-old system that has been treated poorly in the past in many respects and will not serve the retirees or the railroad system effectively well in the future. As a result of an effort on the part of management and labor to bring this issue together, they have worked hard to do so. There are many on my side who disagree and some on the other side who disagree. This issue does not find unanimous support in the Senate. I would hope issues of such critical nature could find unanimous support, but that will not happen. It is important this issue be addressed. I hope the Senate can work its will. I will support efforts to bring it to the floor. At the same time, I hope the Democrat leadership understands a recession has been declared in this country by the institutions that measure our economics and measure the output of our economy. If we are in recession--and we are--we ought to deal with a stimulus package that will bring investment and job creation back to the marketplace. We ought to be understanding that we are at war. We ought to move expeditiously, as the House now is, to deal with the DOD package to make sure our men and women in harm's way are adequately funded, and that all of the issues of post-September 11 are dealt with in the appropriate fashion. That doesn't mean we have to stay here for the next 3 weeks to get that done. We do our timely work now; we come back in late January and do the balance. This is an issue that could have been dealt with in late January, as can agriculture, as energy, I hope, will be with a date definite and a vote up or down to pass. If energy is not dealt with in that fashion, and if the majority leader does not choose to give us a clear signal as to how energy will be voted on, energy will be an amendment to any amendable bill that comes before the Senate following the current effort. This bill will be amendable. Maybe energy fits well into a railroad retirement package. It is every bit as critical to a broader base of the American economy as this bill is very critical to a lot of people in my State and across the Nation. To reiterate, I support the railroad retirement legislation. I am one of the 75 cosponsors in the Senate. In the last Congress, when I was briefly a member of the Senate Finance Committee, I had an opportunity to participate in the hearings on the bill and vote in favor of passing it and sending it to the Senate floor for consideration. While I am a supporter of this bill, I can understand why some of my colleagues have genuine problems with it. Does this bill take a flawed system and make it perfect? No. However, does this bill take a flawed system and dramatically improve it? Yes. I am here today to urge my colleagues: Do not let the perfect be the enemy of the very, very good. It is no small feat that rail labor and rail management came together, reasoned together in good faith, and devoted a great deal of energy, expertise, and old-fashioned innovation to improving a 65-year-old system in a bright and forward-thinking way. They have fashioned a remarkably good bill. It removes a 65-year-old requirement that assets of the system be invested solely in Federal instruments. It permits the kind of investments that any other industry pension plan might make. As a result, over time the system will bring in more revenue, and that will permit better benefits for retirees and surviving spouses, while reducing the contributions needed from rail employers. It is important to remember that this bill also provides for the possibility that the returns on investments might be less than history suggests they will be. If that should occur, it would trigger an automatic adjustment mechanism requiring more contributions from the industry. This protects the federal government and the nation's taxpayers. On the other hand, if returns are greater than projected, both labor and management will be able to reduce contributions further. The new Investment Trust created by the bill will not include any government employees and will not be appointed by any. Trustees will be subject to ERISA fiduciary standards. They will be able to hire professional pension investment advisors. Congress will annually receive a report on the results of the investment efforts. Let me also address the so-called ``cost'' of this bill. I agree with the House of Representatives that changing the investment mix is not an outlay, but just a new means of financing the government's obligations under the system. Those who take balanced federal budgets seriously should have no reason to back away from this legislation. Mr. President, the thousands of working men and women, retirees, and surviving spouses who will benefit from this legislation have waited patiently while this bill has been reviewed again and again. They have waited long enough. This bill is an enormous step in the right direction, and one the entire Senate should support. I yield the floor.","word.count":1042,"sep11":0.221910112359551,"years":2002.08146067416,"days":2521,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0182977083339066,"Topic 2":0.0185348013056602,"Topic 3":0.0220092194743679,"Topic 4":0.421977388183488,"Topic 5":0.00161879274315772,"Topic 6":0.00689855616188645,"Topic 7":0.0125250611993864,"Topic 8":0.0583163414697077,"Topic 9":0.436500804275949,"Topic 10":0.00332132685249018},{"id":"11020070094174","body":"Barbara A.

There is some indication that maybe the problem is they don't like the fact there are some Banking conferees.

It's an amazing achievement. No other sitting Senator has cast more than 15,000 votes. Senator Thurmond, who is no longer with us, cast the next highest total of 16,348 votes. Mr. President, Senator Byrd has had a long and distinguished career in the United States Senate. He was first elected to this body in 1958. Only Senator Thurmond served longer, but Senator Byrd may soon pass that record, too--he's only got two more years to go. He became the Democratic Leader in 1977, holding that position for six consecutive 2- year terms, three terms as majority leader, and three as minority leader. He also served as President pro tempore--third in line in the order of succession to the Presidency, after the Vice President and the Speaker of the House--from 1989 to 1995 and 2001 to 2003. The Senator from West Virginia is also a master historian. His four- volume, 3,000 page history of the U.S. Senate has been called ``the most ambitious study of the U.S. Senate in all of our history.'' He is a passionate advocate for understanding our history, not only among Senators, but for the entire country. In 2000, the Senator's efforts led to the creation of the Teaching American History Grant Program-- commonly referred to as the Byrd grants--to encourage better teaching of American history in our schools. I was fortunate to follow his lead with a bill I introduced last year, the American History and Civics Education Act, which Senator Byrd co-sponsored. The Senate passed it unanimously last year, 91 to 0. I hope the House will act on it soon. I'm sure one reason the Senate was prepared to support such a bill is that we have all learned the value of our history from one of history's great teachers: Senator Robert C. Byrd.

Focus: HOPE was established in 1968 by the late Father William Cunningham and Eleanor Josaitis. The riots of 1967 had a deep impact on the entire Detroit metropolitan area. For all the damage the riots did to our communities, one positive and lasting impact was that they served as a catalyst for the creation of Focus: HOPE.

That was not the case when this measure left the Senate, nor was it apparently the case in the conference committee prior to the intervention of the Administration. Members of the conference committee have noted that bipartisan negotiations on this measure in committee had been productive prior to the insistence by the White House that the provisions extending relief to multiemployer plans be greatly restricted, leaving thousands of businesses and 9.4 million workers high and dry. Particularly disturbing are reports that while multiemployer plan relief was drastically reduced by the conferees, special consideration was provided for at least one large corporation that contributes to a multiemployer plan. The Wall Street Journal today reported that ``the final provisions also showed the remarkable influence'' of that corporation, noting that it ``used the bill to pursue its own agenda'' and that the provisions in the conference report were ``tailored to provide the most help'' to the fund to which the company contributed. This tailored assistance stands in stark contrast to the lack of relief to the thousands of smaller employers and the workers they employ. Mr. President, I supported the pension relief package that the Finance Committee crafted a few weeks ago. I am pleased that some of the provision in that measure remain in the conference report, and that with the expected passage of this legislation many plans will get the relief they need. But I regret that while conferees reportedly tailored multiemployer relief to help at least one large corporation, they abandoned the multiemployer relief that helps thousands of small businesses and their workers.

It is incredible, absolutely incredible that the current tax law provides simplified tax forms for all Americans except those over 65. This is nothing other than age discrimination on the part of the Federal agency, the IRS. We are told that this injustice stems from an earlier era where all Americans retired at 65 and the 1040EZ had no place to report retirement income. That is no excuse. It is no excuse for not providing a short form for our seniors. If a 1040EZ does not do the job, then we ought to have a separate form that does. Again, that is what this bill does today. This legislation creates the 1040S for seniors that is a simplified tax form. It will provide our seniors with a short form similar to the EZ that all the country can use; and amazingly enough, it results in tax savings. Tax savings and Federal dollar savings for the IRS. There are an estimated 11 million Americans over the age of 65 who currently file the standard 1040 form without taking one itemized deduction. They would be delighted to be able to use a new short form if one were available. We know that the current EZ form costs the IRS about half as much to process as the standard 1040. So we can reasonably expect that we will save 50 percent of the cost of processing associated with the 1040S. Are there any objections to the bill? Apparently not. I am delighted to have the support from both parties, from both sides of the aisle; but we are not willing to admit the fact that this is something that we have to get done today. Some believe that this form will make it easier for seniors to file their taxes, but it might be at the expense of making it harder for the IRS to audit their returns through an automated system. I do not think that is the case; but if it is the case, then I am going to side with the senior taxpayer over the Federal tax collectors each day and every day. Some believe that we ought to do nothing. Just wait, just wait for the IRS to make the changes themselves, that given time, given time, they will do what is right. They will do what they ought to do. They will create a form. We have been waiting 24 years. Why is this bill necessary? We have had a 1040EZ for 2 decades without having a single, simple tax form for seniors. Really a violation of the Civil Rights Act. The Treasury says they are still studying the matter. We have crafted this bill with the help of the Committee on Ways and Means, working with Treasury, to ensure that the bill guarantees a truly effective short form by 2005, a date certain, 2005. We have done so without leaving any loophole. Do not allow the IRS to avoid moving forward to produce anything less than a simple form for seniors equal to the simple form employed by all other taxpayers. We have amended the bill to remove all excuses for creating a true short form and provide the force of law against an action spanning years, and indeed decades, by bureaucrats. It does not take the IRS 2 years to audit seniors. It does not take them 2 years to place liens on their homes. It should not take 2 years to draw up a simple form to make it a little easier for seniors to figure out their tax obligation; 2 years can be an eternity for someone in their sunset years. So if the IRS is truly planning on finally coming out with this short form for seniors, fine. This bill will not hurt a thing. But if they are planning on more stalling, they just got a kick start from the Congress. We are resolved that before this session is over, we will have a law in place that guarantees our seniors will no longer be subject to the blatant age discrimination that they have suffered for years through not having access to a short filing form like the rest of their fellow Americans. My colleagues, it is pretty simple. It is time that we pass the Simple Tax Act For Seniors, H.R. 4109. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.","word.count":842,"sep11":2.79494382022472,"years":2004.65449438202,"days":3437,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0722065721327367,"Topic 2":0.347876419834407,"Topic 3":0.0760383025524879,"Topic 4":0.194409419209561,"Topic 5":0.0248576044749251,"Topic 6":0.05131117528834,"Topic 7":0.0222939443914097,"Topic 8":0.0258236998830986,"Topic 9":0.0285843639649579,"Topic 10":0.156598498268076},{"id":"10519970008154","body":"Jesse Jackson: Mr. Chairman, with the greatest personal respect for my colleagues from Illinois and Missouri, I oppose the gentleman from Illinois' amendment to increase funding for this program from the $42 million included in the bill to approximately $150 million per year. While I agree that providing transportation for welfare recipients to get to jobs is critical, I question whether increasing the funding for the pilot program contained in this bill is the best approach to achieving this worthy result. This pilot program promotes new and innovative approaches to providing transportation and makes funding available to nontraditional transit grant recipients in addition to public transit agencies. There is concern among some in the transit community that a new program that is large and proscriptive is not only unnecessary but would take flexibility and control away from transit agencies whose very mission it is to provide access to jobs. There also are significant transportation resources for access to jobs activities under a number of federally funded social services programs already in place. These include the Department of Health and Human Services Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, the Department of Labor's Welfare to Work program comprising $3 billion over 2 years and the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Bridges to Work program. Should the pilot program contained in this bill prove to be successful in conjunction with these many other programs of Federal agencies, we can then reevaluate whether to increase the funding in future transportation legislation.

Mark's life has been about service to others. Whether as a teacher in the bowery of New York, a counselor to troubled teens in Boston, an aide to our beloved Fritz Mondale, or State economic development leader working to bring quality jobs to his constituents, or a Senator, Mark Dayton has consistently answered the call of public service throughout his long and outstanding career. He has been a champion of the right to quality and affordable health care for all Americans, and I know how frustrated he has often been by our inability to make greater progress on this critical domestic issue. Sadly, it will be harder to get there without him, but I am optimistic that we will still be able to accomplish it, and I have no doubt that Mark will continue with his commitment and compassion to help lead the charge from outside the Senate. As a Senator, he had an indispensable role in our effort to expand the availability of prescription drugs. His heart went out to the senior citizens in Minnesota whose only hope to afford the drugs they desperately needed was to cross the border into Canada. Fortunately, in its effort to build a legal fence to keep them out, the drug industry more than met its match in Senator Mark Dayton. Even my constituents in Massachusetts loved Mark, as they boarded buses from Boston to Minnesota to catch the lifesaving bus to Canada and get their medicine. Mark also has had the courage to stand against the administration when it launched the tragic and misguided war in Iraq. He never wavered in the Senate from what he believed was right, and we will all miss the skill and eloquence, the decency, honor, and generosity he brought to our Senate debates. We regret very much that he won't be here with us in the debates ahead, and we wish him well. Perhaps he will be able to make that Arctic trek to the North Pole that he had to put on hold when he came to the Senate 6 years ago. But I know that whatever new course he chooses, he will continue to be a strong and vital voice in improving the lives of others. As Robert Kennedy said, ``Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring, those ripples build a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.'' Throughout his brilliant career, Mark Dayton has sent forth many ripples of hope, and I'm certain he'll send forth many more in the years ahead. We'll miss you, Mark.","word.count":505,"sep11":5.37359550561798,"years":2007.23314606742,"days":4355,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.336884703522224,"Topic 2":0.0186101740604019,"Topic 3":0.0127155748128133,"Topic 4":0.183688376946395,"Topic 5":0.00350762539018769,"Topic 6":0.25372135619244,"Topic 7":0.00854762608488193,"Topic 8":0.112792153727199,"Topic 9":0.0653938924807654,"Topic 10":0.00413851678269173},{"id":"10619990000693","body":"Other: Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes.","word.count":107,"sep11":-2.65730337078652,"years":1999.20224719101,"days":1496,"party":"Other","chamber":"","Topic 1":0.904258286363758,"Topic 2":0.0152931463544266,"Topic 3":0.0404886503917743,"Topic 4":0.00967836575145252,"Topic 5":0.00536988738361837,"Topic 6":0.010186718819168,"Topic 7":0.00250151456135925,"Topic 8":0.00776025458918497,"Topic 9":0.00292590706343187,"Topic 10":0.00153726872182677},{"id":"10920050016957","body":"Sheila Jackson-Lee: Mr. Speaker, the sound you hear on the other side of the aisle is the sound of flip-flopping.

The amendment deals with the issue of bid protest jurisdiction in the Federal district courts and the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. The amendment will expand the bid protest jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims. It should be noted, however, that this amendment in no way expands the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims beyond bid protests or changes the standard of review in any other area of jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims. Currently, the Court of Federal Claims only has jurisdiction over bid protests which are filed before a contract award is made. My amendment provides for both pre- and post-award jurisdiction. The Federal district courts also have jurisdiction over bid protests. Prior to a 1969 Federal court decision, however, the Federal district courts had no jurisdiction over Federal contract awards. A Federal district court, in Scanwell Lab., Inc. versus Shaffer, held that a contractor can challenge a Federal contract award in Federal district court under the Administrative Procedures Act. It is my belief that having multiple judicial bodies review bid protests of Federal contracts has resulted in forum shopping as litigants search for the most favorable forum. Additionally, the resulting disparate bodies of law between the circuits has created a situation where there is no national uniformity in resolving these disputes. That is why I have included provisions in this amendment for studying the issue of concurrent jurisdiction and have provided for the repeal of the Federal district courts' Scanwell jurisdiction after the study is complete in 2001. The chamber of commerce fully supports this language as do our colleagues in the other chamber.

Unfortunately, I will not be able to vote for the resolution or any of the five alternatives put forth before us tonight, because none of them have a good combination of debt relief and spending priorities. The Republican resolution offered by Mr. Kasich shortchanges important domestic programs by cutting non-defense discretionary spending by $6.9 billion over 2000 levels. This would mean that over 300,000 students will lose their Pell grants for college, and that almost 2,000 FBI and DEA agents will lose their jobs. In addition, the Kasich resolution does not provide near enough money for debt relief. Virtually all economists, including Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, have argued that there is almost no better way of improving the government's finances than reducing the debt. That is also why I am opposing the Democratic, Black Caucus, and Progressive Caucus alternatives, because they do not reserve enough money for debt reduction. In contrast, while I support the Blue Dog's position on using one- half of the surplus debt reduction, I believe that their high spending on defense--even higher than the Kasich resolution--jeopardizes other discretionary spending. Specifically, I am particularly opposed to the Blue Dog substitute because of the cuts in transportation spending. Under this proposal, and that of the CATS substitute and the Black Caucus substitute, it would not be possible to honor the commitments Congress made in TEA 21 and AIR 21 transportation bills, thereby risking the safety of millions of motorists and air travelers. I appreciate the hard work and effort that my colleagues put into their respective proposals, but unfortunately, I do not feel that any of these proposals have the right mix of savings for debt reduction and funding for our nation's infrastructure needs. Moreover, this and other recent budget resolutions have been composed of blue smoke and mirrors that do not reflect year-spending agreements, Rather, it is unfortunate that the budget resolutions have been and will continue to be breached during appropriation's negotiations between Congressional leaders and the White House. Hopefully, this and future Congress will break that cycle and lead us into the 21st Century in a fiscally responsible manner.","word.count":369,"sep11":-1.50842696629213,"years":2000.35112359551,"days":1905,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.10223517006019,"Topic 2":0.102325854537889,"Topic 3":0.00555022032582689,"Topic 4":0.00514373095663313,"Topic 5":0.0135437213628605,"Topic 6":0.342470140123819,"Topic 7":0.00491586412396277,"Topic 8":0.264303691804881,"Topic 9":0.154547842683661,"Topic 10":0.00496376402027633},{"id":"10820030009450","body":"Jim McCrery: Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Utah is recognized for 5 minutes.","word.count":337,"sep11":1.61797752808989,"years":2003.47752808989,"days":3018,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0277986054788085,"Topic 2":0.295556397999542,"Topic 3":0.0632703461137073,"Topic 4":0.226284601834502,"Topic 5":0.238886282099374,"Topic 6":0.00849674647553323,"Topic 7":0.0224135689257506,"Topic 8":0.029817522622877,"Topic 9":0.0767748084275503,"Topic 10":0.0107011200223548},{"id":"10419960012916","body":"Speaker: Pursuant to House Resolution 409 and rule XXIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 2715.

The American people I believe have demanded welfare reform, and I am pleased that the Congress has not yielded in its commitment to pass much needed and long overdue comprehensive welfare reform. Our current welfare system is a death sentence. It is a death sentence to the human spirit, the family, and the hopes and dreams of millions of children in America. The welfare system today encourages dependency, facilitates the breakdown of the family, demoralizes the human spirit, and undermines the work ethic that built our Nation. For a third time this Congress has delivered legislation to address the failures of the welfare state and provide reforms that I believe will free the poor from being trapped in a cycle of dependency. This bill is the boldest statement we can make in the current political environment, and I am pleased that the President has finally pledged to keep his promise to end welfare as we know it. Mr. President, the imperative for welfare reform is manifest. The American taxpayers have spent more than $5.4 trillion since President Johnson declared a war on poverty. But after spending this massive sum, we are no closer to having a Great Society than if we had done nothing. In fact, the poverty rate in America has actually increased over the past 28 years. The reason for this is simple: Welfare has become a way of life. The modern welfare State is rife with financial incentives for mothers to remain unmarried. Eighty percent of children in many low- income communities in America are born in homes without a father. It is virtually impossible for a young unwed mother with no work skills to escape the welfare trap as we know it today. This has done nothing to stop the ravaging of our cities and the skyrocketing of violent crime. People have become dependent on welfare because it completely destroys the need to work and the natural incentive to become self- sufficient. For more than 30 years the message of the welfare state is that the Government will take care of you. It is a punitive form of assistance. It punishes those who want to work and want to succeed. It punishes those mothers who want to get married and have a husband to help raise the children. Where is the compassion in this present welfare program? It is not there. Only the beltway establishment would dare suggest that providing monthly benefits is more compassionate than fostering the natural inclination in every human being to reach your full potential. However, with the enactment of this bill, Congress will require welfare recipients to work in exchange for benefits for the first time. By imposing a 5-year lifetime limit on welfare benefits, the message of the reformed welfare state is that we will provide temporary assistance to help during hardship as you return to self-sufficiency. The bill we vote on today begins to repair a very badly broken welfare state in other ways. It puts healthy incentives in our welfare system. The generous package of welfare benefits available in America is a magnet for literally hundreds of thousands of legal and illegal immigrants. I do not believe this is just, and this bill properly denies welfare to noncitizens. Also, the Government will no longer tell young women, ``If you have children you are not able to support and you are willing to raise them without a father the Government will reward you and pick up the tab.'' That is the wrong message. This legislation allows States to end additional cash payments to unwed mothers who have additional children while collecting welfare. The bill also permits States to deny cash to unwed teenage mothers and instead provide them with other forms of assistance. It is good for children to see both their parents in the morning, and this bill provides the mechanisms that will make this the norm, not the exception. This legislation represents real welfare reform. The monster that was created over the last 30 years will not change overnight, but we take a significant step today. This bill ensures that welfare finally will benefit, not harm, its beneficiaries. I urge all my colleagues to adopt this landmark legislation.","word.count":722,"sep11":-5.24438202247191,"years":1996.61516853933,"days":575,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.901859314095376,"Topic 2":0.0321812437228657,"Topic 3":0.00648141517604868,"Topic 4":0.0183703869799882,"Topic 5":0.00649072943728844,"Topic 6":0.00687893593471075,"Topic 7":0.00601097113891312,"Topic 8":0.0113646529928145,"Topic 9":0.00753986450080046,"Topic 10":0.00282248602119378},{"id":"10519980087616","body":"Ron Wyden: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

The Senator from North Dakota and I have been debating this legislation now for a year and a half, probably at a much higher decibel level than either of us would have liked. The chairman of the committee, Chairman McCain, and I have been friends for almost 20 years now. For this freshman Senator--not even a full freshman, an arrival in a special election--to have a chance to team up on this important piece of legislation is a great thrill. I thank him and his staff for all of their courtesies. Before I make any final comments, I want to thank Ms. Carole Grunberg of our office who again and again, when this legislation simply did not look like it could go forward, persisted. And she, along with Senator Dorgan's staff and Senator McCain's staff, has helped to get us to this exciting day. I am particularly pleased, Mr. President--I will wrap up with this-- for the benefits that this legislation is going to have for people without a lot of political power in America. I think about the 100,000 home-based businesses I have in my State. I think about the disabled folks who are starting little businesses in their homes. For them, the Internet is the great equalizer. It allows people who think of themselves as the little guy to basically be able to compete in the global economy with the big guys. Unless we come up with some ways to make uniform some of these definitions and terms, which is what we have been trying to do in the last hour--and we have made some real headway and reached a success-- those little guys are going to find it hard to compete. So I look forward to continuing the discussions with our colleagues as we look to other questions with respect to the Internet. This, it seems to me, is just the beginning of the discussion rather than the end. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues now to support this modified amendment, to support the bill, and I yield the floor.","word.count":553,"sep11":-3.00280898876404,"years":1998.85674157303,"days":1373,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0464676306488722,"Topic 2":0.0247046848832642,"Topic 3":0.00534613494983447,"Topic 4":0.0379171734322434,"Topic 5":0.00130215533817164,"Topic 6":0.0326115288382445,"Topic 7":0.136043606412538,"Topic 8":0.00906109899995874,"Topic 9":0.704519913322045,"Topic 10":0.00202607317482727},{"id":"10519970062327","body":"Barbara Boxer: I am very pleased we could agree on language in the managers' amendment which authorizes new demonstration programs for technology skills training for American workers, provided that funding for such training does not diminish funding for existing federal job training programs.

I thank my colleagues for working with me to achieve that end. Still, while many employers in this country are doing a great deal to educate and train technology workers, the clamor for a large increase in non-U.S. citizens to fill high-skill jobs here seems clearly to point to a lack both in those efforts and in our public job training system. Therefore I believe we also need to be sure that those who will benefit the most from any adjustment in immigrant policy will help us to address the underlying problem.

There are also two other visitor centers in Morgan City, so it is not that there is not some process out there already to do that. Again, the point is not to eliminate this visitor center. The point is to say, shouldn't we have a priority--before we allow money to go for another visitor center where there is already one that has just opened 3 years ago, shouldn't we have the people who need housing taken care of?

This was the third International AIDS Conference which I have had the privilege to participate in: several years ago, Durban, South Africa; following that Barcelona, Spain; and now Bangkok, Thailand. My experiences at these conferences, especially very recently in Bangkok, confirmed the vital need for this amendment, which designates $800 million in emergency funding for the Global Fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. Together with the $400 million which the base bill provides for the fund, my amendment would increase the total United States contribution to the fund to $1.2 billion this coming fiscal year. Based on its projection of need, the fund estimates that it will require approximately $3.6 billion in fiscal year 2005. By bringing the total United States contribution to the fund to $1.2 billion, this amendment would provide one-third of that figure as laid out in the Global AIDS legislation. The funding will help treat an additional 2 million people for tuberculosis and an additional half million people for AIDS. Having spent this week, well, the last few days, actually, among the international leaders on the global pandemic, and also with people living with the virus, I can tell my colleagues that the international community is quite disappointed, to put it mildly, about the United States' failure to deliver on promised funding to date; and this amendment would help restore what many see as really the lack of United States leadership and credibility on the HIV/AIDS pandemic. This point was reinforced by Secretary of Health Tommy Thompson's decision to allow a delegation of only approximately 50 people to attend the World AIDS conference this year, down by 236 the year before in Barcelona. It is shameful, I believe, that this administration has prevented many of our best and our brightest scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health from gaining new insights from their colleagues in the international community and from sharing the research they have conducted on this pandemic with their colleagues in the global community. It is tragic that this administration's unilateralist and ideological tendencies have now spread, unfortunately, to the fight on HIV and AIDS. It is morally wrong to allow right-wing ideology to trump science when it comes to the administration's HIV/AIDS prevention policies. Their policies set aside 33 percent of all funding for abstinence only. That denies access to lifesaving technology, including condoms. Simply put, this is irresponsible, unethical, and inhumane. Emphasis should be science based, not ideological. It is unethical, I believe, that the antiretroviral treatment policies are focused more on protecting patents and big pharmaceutical companies than on the urgent need to get fixed-dose combination into the hands of those who need them. Emphasis really should be put on saving lives. And I think it is pretty disingenuous that the administration has proposed cutting our support for the Global Fund, given all these enormous problems that we have, to a measly contribution of about $200 million, rather than the $1.2 billion, which is desperately needed. I must thank the gentleman from Arizona and our ranking member, the gentlewoman from New York , for their unwavering commitment to helping to increase this funding and actually doubling the funding for this Global Fund twice as much as what the initial bill provided for. But, Mr. Chairman, I think we must go further in providing the resources. We have a battle before us to get this devastating and deadly pandemic under control. And why the fund? This fund is the best way to get the money out into the hands of the NGOs immediately. It is a multilateral approach. For example, $1 billion could leverage up to $9 billion to $10 billion from the private sector, from additional donor countries, and from foundations. We are the wealthiest country in the world. We should be leading the charge. This Global Fund is the best vehicle to show that type of cooperation to provide for the quick release of this money. I met with too many people, Mr. Chairman, who are living and dying with this disease. For example, I participated in one meeting with women leaders. There were maybe 50 to 75 women in the room. Over half of them were living with the virus. One woman happened to share a story with us, and she indicated that she had recently gotten married. She did not know that her husband was HIV infected. Four months later, after her marriage, lo and behold she has the virus. I could go on and on with stories about orphans and vulnerable children; stories about women who cannot negotiate abstention; stories about women who are subjected to violence; stories about women and children that need help in terms of antiretroviral treatment. The quickest way for us to address this pandemic is to get the money out, and to get it out quickly. The fund is headed by Secretary Tommy Thompson. It is directed by Dr. Feachem, based in Geneva, Switzerland. They know what they are doing in terms of establishing the criteria, and they know how to get the money out quickly. I would say the bureaucracy is not as stringent as it is through the bilateral programs. So, quite naturally, the money can get to where the people are more quickly and in a way that is more effective. So I would just ask for consideration of this very modest amendment. It is only $800 million more, and it will save millions and millions of lives. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.","word.count":276,"sep11":1.89044943820225,"years":2003.75,"days":3115,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0139565168074856,"Topic 2":0.0768888706809863,"Topic 3":0.00728574036687526,"Topic 4":0.0536190929395146,"Topic 5":0.00277675647943733,"Topic 6":0.435942364661153,"Topic 7":0.0461476520048936,"Topic 8":0.00969750302294519,"Topic 9":0.349987949986018,"Topic 10":0.00369755305069096},{"id":"11020070056192","body":"Thelma D.

These restrictions were first imposed pursuant to authorities found in section 5 of TWEA, following the declaration of a national emergency in 1950 in Proclamation 2914 , and continued annually, after the enactment of IEEPA in 1977, in accordance with section 101 of Public Law 95-223 . The most recent continuation of such TWEA authorities is found in Presidential Determination 2007-32 of September 13, 2007. In a proclamation, which I signed the same day as the order, I terminated, effective the following day, the exercise of TWEA authorities with respect to North Korea. The order I have issued continues the blocking of certain property and interests in property of North Korea or a North Korean national that were blocked as of June 16, 2000, and that remained blocked immediately prior to the date of my order.

I fully recognize the vital role the aviation industry plays in our nation's economy, but it is time for this congress to stop focusing solely on what's good for the airport industry and to start focusing on what's also good for the countless individuals who live near airports and are constantly subjected to the thunderous roar of giants jets overhead. While this measure does include provisions that address aircraft noise, I firmly believe that those steps are inadequate and do not properly address the issue of aircraft noise. Instead of addressing legislation seeking solely to expand this nation's airports, this Congress should also focus its attention on legislation that eliminates aircraft noise. One measure I have introduced would ban the two loudest types of airplane engines from all general aviation airports in the 20 largest metropolitan areas in the country. It is time that we shift our attention away from solely the expansion of airports and toward the problem of aircraft noise which hampers the quality of life for countless American citizens.","word.count":275,"sep11":-0.151685393258427,"years":2001.70786516854,"days":2388,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.155502522256397,"Topic 2":0.564426102241187,"Topic 3":0.0291946459441427,"Topic 4":0.0397090376903255,"Topic 5":0.0611195796567829,"Topic 6":0.0199291772396954,"Topic 7":0.0282971847742576,"Topic 8":0.0357298692642368,"Topic 9":0.0466006108507868,"Topic 10":0.0194912700821877},{"id":"10620000044672","body":"Harry Reid: Mr. President, I appreciate the outline of today's activities by the acting leader.

But I want to begin by paying special tribute to my colleague from Illinois for his leadership on the issues of mental health in the committee and working to try to get more mental health provisions incorporated into this legislation. I also want to add a special word about my Fellow in my office, Berre Burch. Our Fellows do enormous work for all of us. They don't get paid for it, but they are very committed and spend long hours. Berre Burch has been instrumental in working on many of these provisions on mental health in this bill, as well as many others. Mr. Speaker, I know we are in a tight budget year, and often programs are not included in bills such as this because of the expense that they have. But, frankly, Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to see that the mental health needs of our seniors are included in this bill, principally because they do help save us money. Not only do they help save us money in long-term care costs, but they also help save lives as well. Yes, lives. According to the National Institutes of Health, senior citizens commit suicide at a higher rate than any other age group in our country. Now, understand this. Suicide is already twice the rate of homicide in this country. People don't recognize that. For every murder in this country, two people take their lives. Now you can see that having senior citizens have the highest suicide rate of all is pretty startling. It runs in the face of our notion of what the golden years of a senior citizen's life should be all about. We all have been guilty about understanding what it means to be a senior citizen. A lot of us confuse dementia. We say that is part of being old. It doesn't have to be part of what being old is all about. We have proven, effective treatments to intervene with seniors and make sure that the depression that they may be suffering is something that is treated so that their golden years can actually be golden years, where they can live productive, happy lives. But what does this country do to our seniors? They put them away. They put them in senior high-rises. They take them away from their families. They don't support them in their communities. They are detached from the social networks in their communities and from the community bonds that keep them uplifted. Many of them lose their spouse. Many of them lose their independence. They have physical challenges. And all of this leads, very obviously, to anything that we would all acknowledge is depression. Who wouldn't be depressed under these circumstances? The fact of the matter is, Mr. Speaker, they don't have to remain depressed. They can get treatment. We can intervene and help them out of these very same challenges. Mr. Speaker, this is an issue that has been looked at over and over and over again. Surgeon General Satcher acknowledges it, the New Freedom Commission on Mental Health by President Bush acknowledges it, the White House Commission on Aging, all of whom say that there are many impediments and obstacles to senior citizens getting the mental health care that they need, none the least of which is stigma and stereotype. In my generation, mental health is no longer the stigma that it used to be. But for many senior citizens, when they hear mental health, they think that it is something wrong with them. They think it is something morally wrong with them. We need to tell senior citizens this is part of your health care. The brain is part of your body. When the brain has chemical imbalances, we need to treat those. But, Mr. Speaker, in our country today, even in this great time of prosperity and advancement in science, we still don't acknowledge the brain as part of the body. When it comes to insurance coverage, we don't have parity for mental health or for Medicare parity, which basically means if you have depression or any other mental illness, you are paying a higher copay for your insurance for mental health treatment, you are paying a higher deductible for your health insurance, you are paying a higher premium, because somehow mental health care is treated as if it is cosmetic surgery. It is treated like it is elective surgery. It is not treated as if it is the real physical health challenge that so many millions of Americans face and, tragically, so many senior citizens face on a daily basis. But it doesn't have to be this way. I appreciate the fact that many portions of my bill called the Positive Aging Act were included in this legislation. But I will continue to fight for mental health parity so that we can give all Americans access to mental health services, and I will continue to fight for the Positive Aging Act so we get all of the necessary community support systems in place to help treat our seniors with the dignity and the respect that our senior citizens have earned and that we ought to give them.","word.count":894,"sep11":4.89887640449438,"years":2006.75842696629,"days":4186,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0364967934237794,"Topic 2":0.0534801313550798,"Topic 3":0.0125362967609136,"Topic 4":0.0115285308897202,"Topic 5":0.121985814766258,"Topic 6":0.00421206940080005,"Topic 7":0.00217429022632359,"Topic 8":0.0639814286069137,"Topic 9":0.0119314421133489,"Topic 10":0.681673202456863},{"id":"10519980037120","body":"Jerrold Nadler: Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume I would simply observe, Mr. Speaker, that the gentleman from California apparently was unaware of the subject matter of this motion. We are not talking here about people who are irresponsible, if that is what it is; or perhaps just down on their luck; perhaps they did not have health insurance and needed an expensive operation; got laid off, whatever. We are talking here about people who pay their debts on time every month and for whom the credit card companies now want to say they cannot get credit because they pay their debts. That is what the subject of this motion is. So let us not talk about irresponsibility. And let us not debate about the balanced budget. That is a separate debate. Let us talk about what we are talking about, and what we are talking about is this motion to agree with the Senate amendment, which says that the credit card companies should not be able to charge extra or to eliminate credit all together to a credit card holder simply because he or she commits the terrible sin of paying their debt on time. That is the amendment. So let us not talk about responsibility here. This person is meeting his responsibility or her responsibility. Now, I would like to address the argument of the gentleman from Pennsylvania, who says that if the banks are not earning enough money from these people because they pay their debts on time, and they are not paying, therefore, interest charges; if we do not allow the banks to shut off credit to them; if we do not allow the banks to charge them a special extra fee, to penalize them for paying their debts on time, then that extra cost of the banks will be passed on to the consumer. Frankly, that is not true. In fact, it is nonsensical and history proves it. When we voted in the early 1980s to deregulate interest rates, we were told, hey, the inflation rate in 1979 was 17, 18 percent. We cannot have an interest rate ceiling of 6 percent. The bank is losing money. So we will deregulate the interest rate, we will let the banks charge 20, 21 percent and, of course, when general interest rates come down, the credit card interest rates will also come down. Well, the general interest rates came down. The current Federal Reserve rate is 5.25 percent, and they are thinking of lowering it further. Mortgage rates have come down, car loans have come down, everything has come down except credit card interest rates. They came down from 22 to about 18 percent, but they are way up there, and that is why the profitability jumped. And who in this country really believes that if we allow the banks to gouge people who pay their debts on time that this profitability will not simply go up? Who believes that banks will pass that savings on to the consumer? Who believes that they will lower the interest rates that they have held artificially high by semi-monopolistic practices for the last 15 years? That is absurd. I daresay if I proposed an amendment to mandate that the banks lower the interest rates to reflect this cost, people on that side of the aisle would say, that is terrible, that is socialistic, I do not know what it is, it is paternalistic. But the banks are not going to lower the interest rates. They have not for the last 15 years. It is way above their costs. And that is why from everything else they do they are making a profit in the 1 to 2 percent range. From credit cards they are making a profit in the 4 to 5 percent range because they are gouging the consumers now. They will continue to gouge the consumers. And this is one more way of gouging the consumers they have invented. And the gentleman thinks we should not prevent them from enjoying the fruits of their inventiveness on a new way to gouge consumers. So I hope we pass this; we accede to the Senate amendment, and at least have a little control here and a little sympathy for the responsible consumer who pays his debts. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.","word.count":728,"sep11":-3.03089887640449,"years":1998.82865168539,"days":1363,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0733804369242859,"Topic 2":0.121099286159387,"Topic 3":0.0171475684794236,"Topic 4":0.0098571609612669,"Topic 5":0.00539900018671304,"Topic 6":0.00643459934177983,"Topic 7":0.00960366910344798,"Topic 8":0.0114651238741439,"Topic 9":0.740976219240601,"Topic 10":0.00463693572895092},{"id":"10620000013905","body":"Silvestre Reyes: Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of awarding the Congressional Gold Medal to Pope John Paul II. It is difficult to talk briefly about a man who has done so much since being elected to succeed Pope John Paul I in 1978. So, let me make these few comments. Pope John Paul II has worked tirelessly to unite the people of different countries and different religions, regardless of their color or their politics. He did this as a youth, as a professor at Catholic University of Lublin, as the Archbishop of Krakow and continues to do so as the head of the Roman Catholic Church. He is said to be the most recognized man in the world. In fact he was named ``Man of the Year'' in Time magazine in 1994. But, that is not why I stand before you. I stand before you because this man has dedicated his life to the salvation of others. I still remember when he was chosen by the College of Cardinals. There was a great deal of discussion about him, not because he was selected to become the Pope, but rather because he was the first non Italian Pope since 1522 and because he was only 58 years old. Now, twenty-two years later, neither his birth place nor his age are part of the discussion. I think that there is a lesson for all of us in that fact. I support this award because Pope John Paul II has reached out to the people of this planet. He encourages fraternity and encourages people to live the gospel. And, in the final analysis, he has made the world a better place for us to live. I cannot think of a better reason for this body to give this or any award.","word.count":297,"sep11":-1.33707865168539,"years":2000.52247191011,"days":1966,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.898558049479486,"Topic 2":0.0335993917087812,"Topic 3":0.00706566980544307,"Topic 4":0.0166132427886236,"Topic 5":0.00698795784512085,"Topic 6":0.00821739278820028,"Topic 7":0.00557250368586004,"Topic 8":0.012714179797341,"Topic 9":0.00764579336062814,"Topic 10":0.00302581874051573},{"id":"10419950062302","body":"Peter A. DeFazio: Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor of legislation introduced by the majority leader to establish a National Commission on Medicare Reform. According to the Medicare trustees' report released last Wednesday, June 5, the Medicare hospital insurance trust fund will be bankrupt earlier than expected. In fact, the trustees, of which three of the six trustees are members of President Clinton's Cabinet, indicate that the trust fund may run out of money as early as calendar year 2000. Senator Dole's proposal is consistent with the recommendations of the Medicare trustees. The trustees recommend: We are now 2 years closer to insolvency of the Medicare trust fund than we were at this time last year. We lost a year trying to address the problem, and the program is 1 more year closer to bankruptcy than we expected. Yet, I regret, we are miles away from reaching an agreement on a solution. Given the very short time that Medicare will remain solvent, and given the large number of baby boomers who will be joining the Medicare Program in just a few years, we cannot afford more delay. It is time to put politics aside and find a solution. What is happening to the Medicare trust fund is pretty basic. The program is paying out more than it is taking in. This simple dynamic, if left unchecked, will lead Medicare to bankruptcy in less than 5 years. And, simply put, bankruptcy of the trust fund means there will not be money to pay the hospital bills of our senior citizens and disabled individuals reliant on Medicare. Again, I believe it is time to put politics aside. A Medicare Reform Commission is an important step in the right direction to bringing together a bipartisan, lasting agreement on resolving Medicare's fiscal crisis. The 1983 National Commission on Social Security Reform was an essential catalyst to resolving the then-looming bankruptcy of Social Security. The 1983 Commission brought together people in a cooperative bipartisan spirit. Ultimately, the work of the Commission laid the ground for a solution to the solvency crisis. I believe a Medicare Reform Commission might be able to do the same today. We are facing a crisis. A crisis requires action. We cannot be a government of empty promises. We must restore Medicare to robust health for our children and our grandchildren. S. 1857.

Mr. Speaker, at a time when large corporations and manufacturers are announcing layoffs and scaling back production, more and more regions of the country are learning what western New York already knows; that the small business sector can be the real economic engine for our communities. Small businesses generate the jobs that keep our cities and towns vibrant, they generate the opportunities that anchor our sons and daughters to family and home, and they foster the innovators who represent the brightest hope for our future. Last month I was pleased to host the Small Business Administration's 2002 Young Entrepreneur of the Year, a young man named Aaron Zach Philips from Rochester, New York. Although only 25 years old, Zach has achieved remarkable success. He is the president of Kink BMX, a manufacturer and distributor of BMX bicycle parts and related soft goods. Since 1999, Zach has doubled his company's growth annually with sales reaching nearly $1 million as of March 31, 2001. Zach now does business outside the United States and sells his product through distributors in Europe, Canada, Australia, and Japan. On every mailing logo, every label, every brochure or marketing tool he prints the words ``Rochester Made Means Quality Made.'' Zach embodies a growing trend that Congress must continue to foster. Small businesses now account for approximately 75 percent of all new jobs added to the economy and represent 99.7 percent of all employers. Small businesses provide almost one-third of the workers with their first jobs and initial on-the-job training in basic skills. The important role small businesses play in keeping our Nation competitive must not be overshadowed by corporate America's clout in this body. We must ensure that entrepreneurs like Zach are afforded the same attention and access to Washington that the large corporate interests enjoy. A quick look at the numbers show that small businesses form the backbone of our economy. They account for half of our domestic products and contribute more than 55 percent of the innovations in such sectors as manufacturing, technology and services. During the long boom of the 1990s, small businesses forged the way for high-tech expansion and growth. They now account for almost 40 percent of the jobs in the high- technology sector. One reason for this is that women and minorities are opening small businesses in record numbers. Women-owned businesses nearly doubled during the last decades. There are currently an estimated 6.2 million women-owned businesses, accounting for 28 percent of all privately held firms. These firms generate $1.15 trillion in sales and employ 9.2 million workers. The number of minority-owned enterprises nearly quadrupled in the last decade, and they generally outstrip the national average in business creation and receipts. Minorities now own 15 percent of American business, and 99 percent of these businesses are small businesses. Congress has addressed the needs of small business before. We have passed paperwork reduction legislation, such as the Paperwork Reduction Act, PRA, and the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act. Moreover, the last administration streamlined regulations by reinventing government and implementing many of the recommendations made by the White House Conference on Small Businesses. The measure before us today continues this effort to reduce unnecessary paperwork for small businesses. I know of no opposition to this measure. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.","word.count":568,"sep11":0.786516853932584,"years":2002.64606741573,"days":2722,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.152270943384091,"Topic 2":0.335516178663552,"Topic 3":0.0158962307762092,"Topic 4":0.0114370773064042,"Topic 5":0.447011335627648,"Topic 6":0.00561770150219514,"Topic 7":0.00581112030060677,"Topic 8":0.012895304413089,"Topic 9":0.00708976906063287,"Topic 10":0.00645433896557194},{"id":"10419950146603","body":"Byron Dorgan: Mr. President, if I might just make an observation, I was struck by the comments offered by the Senator from West Virginia and by the Senator from Nevada.

Dodd: Mr. President, I thank both my colleague from Vermont, the chairman of the committee, and the Senator from Pennsylvania as well. I arrived in this body in January of 1981 with a very engaged Senator from Pennsylvania as a new Member that day in January of 1981. The Senator from Vermont had already been here for a term. They do a tremendous job, and their voices are worth listening to on matters affecting civil liberties and the rule of law. I spoke at some length last evening and back in December on the issue of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act amendments and what I consider to be the most egregious provision in the Intelligence Committee bill: retroactive immunity for the telecommunications companies that may have helped this administration break the law. I have objected to that immunity on very specific grounds because it would cover an immense alleged violation of trust, privacy, and civil liberties. But even more importantly, immunity is wrong because of what it represents: a fatal weakening of the rule of law that shuts out our independent judiciary and concentrates all the power in the hands of one branch--the executive branch. We know there has been a pattern of behavior over the past 6 or 7 years. As I said last evening on this floor, had this been the first instance of an administration overreaching, candidly, I would have had some difficulty in objecting to the Intelligence Committee's proposal. If the alleged violation had been limited to a period of a few months, 6 months, a year even after 9/11, I might not have objected. But all of us in this Chamber know there has been a 6 or 7 year pattern of this administration's abuses against the rule of law and civil liberties. And this alleged violation went on not for 6 months or a year but for 5 years--and it would still be ongoing today had it not been for a whistleblower in an article in a major publication, which revealed this program's ongoing activities to literally vacuum--and I am not exaggerating when I say ``vacuum''--every telephone conversation, fax, and e-mail of millions of people in this country. I would object to retroactive immunity not just in this administration but in any administration, Democratic or Republican, that sought immunity to this extent, that sought to concentrate such power in the hands of the executive branch. The Founders of this great Republic strenuously argued for a process that concentrates power not in one branch but provides a balance of that power, a tension, if you will, between the judicial, the legislative, and the executive branches. To grant such power to one branch, as this bill seeks to do, is a dangerous step. And it would be no matter which administration requested it. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, as we have seen, was written precisely to resist that concentration. When we divide power responsibly, terrorist surveillance is not weakened; it is strengthened, Mr. President, made more judicious, more legitimate, and less subject to the abuse that saps public trust. I firmly believe any changes to this FISA bill must be in keeping with the original spirit of shared powers and the respect of the rule of law. If we act wisely, as every previous Congress has for 30 years when amending the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, then I think we can ensure terrorist surveillance remains inside the law--not an exception to it. The Senate should pass a bill doing just that. But the FISA Amendments Act, as it comes to us from the Intelligence Committee, is not that bill, Mr. President. Its safeguards against abuse, against the needless targeting of ordinary American citizens, are far too weak. The power it concentrates in the hands of the executive branch is far too expansive. However, the Senate also has before it a version of a bill that embodies a far greater respect for the rule of law, and that is the proposal before us at this hour, offered by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont. Both versions of the bill--both versions--authorize the American President to conduct overseas surveillance without individual warrants. Both of these bills allow the President of the United States to submit his procedures for this new kind of surveillance for the review of the FISA Court after those procedures are already in place. But only one version of the bill balances these significant new powers with real oversight from the Congress and the courts, and that is the Leahy amendment. That is the balance we need to strike. That is what every Congress has done for three decades--for three decades--with over 35 different changes to this bill, since its adoption in the late 1970s, passing every Congress almost unanimously, with the approval of Democrats and Republicans alike, balancing the tension between our determination to keep us safe from those who would do us harm with our need to protect the rule of law and the rights of the American people. That is the tension, that is the balance that we have struck over the last 30 years. After three decades of maintaining that long-held balance, we are about to deviate from it. The intelligence version of this legislation, I am afraid, is a bill of token oversight and very weak protections for innocent Americans. Specifically, the intelligence version of the bill fails on five specific counts. First, its safeguards against the targeting of Americans--its minimization procedures--are insufficient. The Intelligence Committee bill significantly expands the President's surveillance power while leaving the checks on that power unchanged. The intelligence version provides practically no deterrent against excessive domestic spying and no consequences if the court finds that the President's--any President's--minimization procedures are lacking. If his targeting procedures are found lacking, the President hardly has to worry. They administration can keep and share all the information it has obtained, and it can continue its actions all the way through the judicial review process, which can take months, if not years. It should be clear to all of us that real oversight includes the power of enforcement. The Intelligence Committee's bill offers us the semblance of judicial oversight--but not the real thing. Imagine, if you will, a judge convicting a bank robber and then letting him keep the loot he stole, as long as he promises to never, ever, ever do it again. That might as well be the Intelligence version of the bill. In fact, the Intelligence version would allow the President to immediately target anyone on a whim. Wiretapping could start even before the court has approved it. In the Intelligence Committee bill, oversight is exactly where the President likes it--after the fact. Don't get me wrong, Mr. President, when a President--any President-- needs immediate emergency authority to begin wiretapping, that President should have it. All of us, I think, agree with that. We find that obvious. The question is what to do in those cases that aren't emergencies-- because not every case is an emergency. In those cases, I believe there is no reason that the court shouldn't give advice and approval beforehand. President Bush disagrees. He believes in a permanent state of emergency. Second, the Intelligence Committee bill fails to protect American citizens from reverse targeting--the practice of targeting a foreign person on false pretenses without a warrant in order to collect the information on an American on the other end of the conversation. Reverse targeting, according to Admiral McConnell, the Director of National Intelligence, says: That is according to the Director of National Intelligence. He is absolutely correct, of course, which is why it is so vital the FISA bill before us contain strong enforceable protections against reverse targeting. Unfortunately, the Intelligence Committee version doesn't have one. Third, the intelligence version, by purporting to end warrantless wiretapping of Americans, might actually allow it to continue unabated. That is because the bill lacks strong exclusivity language--language stating that FISA is the only controlling law for foreign intelligence surveillance. With that provision in place, surveillance has a place inside the rule of law. Without it, there is no such guarantee, Mr. President. Who knows what specious rationale this or any administration might cook up for lawless spying? The last time, as we have seen, Alberto Gonzalez--laughably, I might add, if it weren't so tragic--tried to find grounds for warrantless wiretapping in the authorization of force against Afghanistan. Those are the legal lengths to which this administration has proved willing and able to go to in order to achieve its goals. As I mentioned last evening, Senator Daschle, the former majority leader, who was deeply involved in the negotiations of the authorization language to use force in Afghanistan, wrote an op-ed piece absolutely debunking the argument that any part of that negotiation included granting the administration the power to conduct warrantless wiretaps. He was offended by the suggestion that somehow we in this Congress, on a vote of 98 to nothing, gave the administration the power to conduct warrantless wiretappings. He was directly involved in those negotiations. It never, ever, ever came up. It is offensive that Alberto Gonzalez argued that Afghanistan justified warrantless wiretapping is offensive--but it is a good example, Mr. President, of what can happen if you don't have exclusivity. FISA is the vehicle, and has been for 30 years, by which we allow for warrants to be granted to conduct surveillance when America is threatened. What is next without strong exclusivity language? The Intelligence Committee version of the bill would leave that question hanging over our heads. Fourth, Mr. President, unlike the Leahy amendment, the Intelligence Committee version of the bill lacks strong protections against what is call","word.count":2912,"sep11":6.53370786516854,"years":2008.39325842697,"days":4768,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0284697962805893,"Topic 2":0.672030791122944,"Topic 3":0.232087162249465,"Topic 4":0.0134530636054112,"Topic 5":0.0148683665959829,"Topic 6":0.00801404090477029,"Topic 7":0.00875465703288943,"Topic 8":0.0100667075265748,"Topic 9":0.00918714650087307,"Topic 10":0.00306826818049938},{"id":"10920060044265","body":"John McCain: Mr. President, if the Senator yields for a question, then he maintains the right to the floor.

As the Senator from Oregon knows, there are several other pending amendments that we think are important as well, particularly having to do with earmarks. I note this morning in a Wall Street Journal-NBC poll, the No. 1 concern of Americans is earmarks. I find it very interesting that they are sick and tired of the absolutely incredible stuff we have loaded into this bill. The Senator from Oklahoma and I have an amendment about seafood marketing. The Senator from Oregon, I am sure, probably remembers that last year they spent some half a million to paint a giant salmon on a 737.

I make two other points after commending my colleagues on the bill overall. I am proud to be a cosponsor and supporter of this bill. There are two parts of the bill in which I was particularly interested. One is identity theft which has become an epidemic. When your identity is stolen, it can take years to bring back your credit rating, even through no fault of your own. The criminals are getting very good at identity theft. I introduced comprehensive legislation in this regard much earlier this year. The chairman has added provisions very similar to those I have introduced. As a result, this bill does a good job. Right now, becoming a victim of identity theft is as easy as saying your ABC's. With this legislation, it will be tougher. My hometown, New York City, has the unfortunate distinction of being the identity theft capital of the world. I am glad we were able to do something quickly in that regard. Second, on credit scoring, this is another issue on which the Senator from Colorado and myself worked long and hard. We thank the chairman and ranking member for incorporating that into the legislation. The bottom line is, consumers have been kept in the dark about what their credit score is and how it is computed. This legislation, by adding the Schumer-Allard provision, lifts the veil of secrecy over credit scores. When a bank is going to charge you more for your mortgage, which could mean hundreds and hundreds of dollars every quarter, much more money every month, now you will be able to find out why and if there is incorrect information as to why you are being charged more. Maybe it is because you have a whole lot of credit cards, for instance, even if you pay your bills on time. You will be able to correct it. This is fine legislation. I am speeding things along here because I know people want to move quickly. I thank the chairman.","word.count":370,"sep11":2.20224719101124,"years":2004.06179775281,"days":3226,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.784164894192099,"Topic 2":0.0106237788080692,"Topic 3":0.00761028822726243,"Topic 4":0.014445312306207,"Topic 5":0.00778783242203878,"Topic 6":0.145673946728975,"Topic 7":0.00374739158269546,"Topic 8":0.0128130860186677,"Topic 9":0.0118937505877338,"Topic 10":0.00123971912625163},{"id":"10920060057933","body":"Ted Stevens: Mr. President, we join the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed, with his distinguished military career, who has raised this issue. Some time ago, we had reports on this matter of the reset funding and the goal of about $17 billion for that purpose. I personally visited with Secretary Rumsfeld and Deputy Secretary Gordan England and Admiral Giambastiani about this and asked they check how much was needed for this reset operation and urged them to deal with the Office of Management and Budget so we would not have any problem over the total amount. If you examine the bill, as we have it now, with the moneys we added last night, and the money that is already in the bridge account, there is the $17 billion there that was requested by the military. In my trips to Iraq, I visited some of the places where they are up- armoring large trucks and up-armoring some of the humvees and saw some of the activities they were pursuing in order to get better armor on some of the helicopters. All of this is part of the process, and it is not something new. After the Persian Gulf war we had two separate requests for funds for the reset activities. And ``reset'' is a word of art in the military; that is, to literally reset the force and the equipment so it is usable and ready in the event of another operation, should that be necessary. But again, we had several sums suggested. And when we went to the OMB and to the Department, they came back with the figures we offered the Senate last night on a bipartisan basis. I think they are sufficient at this time to carry us through. We will have a supplemental in the spring. We all know that. The bridge is to carry us forward through the period until we look at what might be the requirements for the operations going on in some 120 countries. As I said yesterday, in terms of our people in uniform, they are in 120 countries as we speak. So this is an enormous problem to assure that the equipment and all of the systems are brought up to absolute the best state possible. But again, Senator Reed has put forth his comments about this necessity from his military background. We appreciate that, and we agree with him. We agreed with him, and, as a matter of fact, the moneys we added last night were in addition to what the Senator was seeking because they cover some other activities beyond what he was talking about.","word.count":435,"sep11":5.01685393258427,"years":2006.87640449438,"days":4228,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0399425957935983,"Topic 2":0.00447077446268588,"Topic 3":0.00355072910714032,"Topic 4":0.00340932935071552,"Topic 5":0.00984742795157977,"Topic 6":0.0021521664916336,"Topic 7":0.0012271898842106,"Topic 8":0.885642723720781,"Topic 9":0.00471951964194952,"Topic 10":0.0450375435957056},{"id":"10720010022129","body":"Joe Baca: Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss a serious disease or illness that affects a great many in our country. It is Alzheimer's disease. I have been a longtime advocate for increasing research for treatment and cures for Alzheimer's. I was particularly touched by a recent article in Time Magazine by Patti Davis, President Ronald Reagan's daughter, discussing her family's battle with Alzheimer's. I include that for the Record. The article referred to is as follows: We learn about the disease by looking into the eyes of victims--and During the August recess, I had the opportunity to speak to the Houston Alzheimer's Association's educational symposium in Houston with Dr. Rachel Doody, who has a well-known research program at Baylor College of Medicine in the Texas Medical Center. The number of people at that event, it amazed me. It was the first time I had the opportunity to address that group and see how many people were interested. The battle that we have affects far too many Americans. More than 4 million Americans, one in ten over 65 and nearly half those over 85, suffer from Alzheimer's disease. With the aging baby boom population, unless a cure is found, 14 million Americans will have Alzheimer's by 2050. I personally have been touched by Alzheimer's when my mother-in-law was diagnosed with this disease several years ago. I know firsthand the incredible toll Alzheimer's has on not only that person, but also the family. As a family member, I know the heartache of watching a vibrant and active and independent loved one become lost in a world of confusion, isolation, and despair. I know the frustration that there are so few treatments and no cure to this disease. As a policymaker, I am concerned by the staggering economic burden of this illness. The U.S. society spends at least $100 billion a year on Alzheimer's. Neither Medicare nor most private health insurance covers the long-term care many patients need. Alzheimer's disease is costing American business $61 billion a year: $36.5 billion is the cost to business of caregiving, and the rest is the business share of the cost of health care and long-term care. While I am proud that the National Institutes of Health spends almost $599 million on Alzheimer's disease research, that number seems insignificant in light of the cost of this disease. We must do more to study the causes and risk factors of Alzheimer's and to develop a new way to diagnose the disease, and to develop new methods for treatment and caregiving. Five years ago, Congress made a commitment to double the budget of the NIH so more money could be invested to find a cure for many diseases, such as Alzheimer's. I have been a longtime proponent of doubling the funding for NIH, and hope we will be able to achieve our goal of doubling the NIH budget in this, the final year of that commitment. But there are other things Congress can and should do to aid in the fight against Alzheimer's. We must ensure that the individuals who care for people with Alzheimer's have the resources they need to keep their family members at home as long as possible. We should pass legislation which allows individuals to deduct their long-term care expenses from their income tax and would help alleviate some of the financial burdens on the family caring for a loved one with Alzheimer's. We should pass legislation which would provide respite care for these caregivers. These are just a few steps Congress should take. I urge the leadership to take up these bills and do everything we can to support the millions of Americans who suffer from Alzheimer's. I would like to close with a quote from Patty Davis's article in Time magazine of last week: ``Perhaps the next time Members of Congress assemble to decide how much money to set aside for Alzheimer's research, they should be asked to listen to silence differently as if it were a jail sentence. Maybe then we would then look into their hearts and know that if stopping a disease that is stalking so many is not a top priority, maybe we have lost our collective heart as a Nation.''","word.count":417,"sep11":0,"years":2001.8595505618,"days":2442,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.746514949327888,"Topic 2":0.0844070894213396,"Topic 3":0.0183637780457605,"Topic 4":0.0390154274246368,"Topic 5":0.0187238754093806,"Topic 6":0.0175150798849644,"Topic 7":0.0146157205104219,"Topic 8":0.0319025652509988,"Topic 9":0.0203689196321107,"Topic 10":0.00857259509249873},{"id":"10619990011878","body":"David Dreier: Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time. Mr. Speaker, before any of us can speak on this floor, we first have to take an oath to defend the Constitution of the United States. That Constitution was created by our Founding Fathers because they had a huge suspicion of power, especially executive power. That is why they created an Article I of the Constitution, the Congress of the United States, an independent branch of Government. And to keep it independent and to make certain that we would never have excess power in the hands of the executive, they lodged in this institution the power of the purse. Today if we pass this proposal, we are walking away from our constitutional obligation to defend the power of the purse. The chairman of the Committee on Rules is absolutely right. There is absolutely nothing partisan about this debate. This is a debate about power and the use and misuse of power and how you best maintain checks on that use of power. I think there are two fundamental problems with this proposition. First of all, because we create a joint resolution instead of a concurrent resolution when the budget resolution passes, that means for the first time the President imposes himself right in the middle of Congress' obligation to define its own budget resolution. So the President gets two kicks at the cat: once when he submits his budget and then another when he puts together a huge budget summit out at Andrews or some other place like they have been in the past, and the President will come to totally dominate that debate. And every rank and file Member of this place will be on the outside looking in, passing notes in, hoping that a handful of people on the inside will give them an occasional listen. We do not want to do that. Secondly, it will enhance the power of the Senate vis-a-vis the House. The House has a Committee on Rules but the Senate runs on unanimous consent and a system of holds, and in order to get anything done in the Senate, the Senate leadership is going to be vulnerable to having any Senate chairman come to them and say, ``I'm not going to vote for your budget resolution unless you add my authorization bill to the budget resolution,'' and you will have a huge incentive to have everything but the kitchen sink added in the Senate. Secondly, we have another problem with this proposition, and that is 2-year budgeting. Right now every year, every agency of government has to justify every action to the people's representatives. What will happen if we move to a system of 2-year budgeting is that we will move to a system of permanent supplementals and it is far more difficult to control spending on supplementals than it is on regular appropriation bills, because again in the House we have a germaneness rule, but in the Senate there is no germaneness rule. And so they can add virtually anything they want. That in my view weakens the House vis-a-vis the Senate; it allows Senators to add amendment after amendment and project after project. House Members will not have that same privilege or opportunity. And most of all, it makes the agencies of government even more independent of legislative power than they are right now. Because once you have passed an agency budget, they have their money for a 2- year period and they do not have to come to this House for anything. Now, Members will say, ``Well, but if you have supplementals, they'll have to come back here for those.'' That is true. But supplementals are always to add money to their programs. They are programmatic supplementals. They have nothing whatsoever to do with agency staffing levels, agency bureaucratic structure, and so they will have been able to pocket what they want on the administrative end of their budgets, and that means that they will be far more immune to the legitimate Congressional questioning of their actions than they are right now. I think in the end that makes this institution fundamentally weaker in constitutional terms than it is right now, both vis-a-vis the executive branch of government and vis-a-vis the other body. I think both actions would be a mistake. I would urge the House to cast a bipartisan ``no'' on this proposition when we get the opportunity.","word.count":131,"sep11":-2.39325842696629,"years":1999.46629213483,"days":1590,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0859110342140489,"Topic 2":0.111446963291207,"Topic 3":0.017799980341295,"Topic 4":0.0402183205812679,"Topic 5":0.00421281819195168,"Topic 6":0.00965589870881196,"Topic 7":0.503319368706013,"Topic 8":0.0207099565398057,"Topic 9":0.202149986972903,"Topic 10":0.00457567245269625},{"id":"10519980046937","body":"Trent Lott: Mr. President, this morning the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 2 p.m. At 2 p.m., the Senate will resume consideration of S. 1173, the so-called ISTEA legislation, which is the surface transportation authorization bill.

This has been a remarkable program that has gone on. And I want to add my compliments to the staff, all the staff on the minority who worked on it, as well as Peter Yeo and Pearl-Alice Marsh and David Abramowitz, Kristin Wells, Heather Flynn with Chairman Don Payne, Christos Tsentas with Congresswoman Lee, as well as Mark Synnes with legislative counsel, Naomi Seiler and Jessica Boyer from the Oversight Committee staff, and on the Senate Foreign Relations majority staff, Brian McKeon and Shannon Smith. These are people who not only helped put this bill together, not only invested huge amounts of their time in working with the outside coalition forces, who have been working on the ground on these issues in Africa and other places, and also dealt with the administration, these are people who, when I got thrown into this issue, helped educate me. And I'm very grateful for all they have done to make this happen.","word.count":353,"sep11":7.04494382022472,"years":2008.90449438202,"days":4950,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0208174535674073,"Topic 2":0.0429513237519606,"Topic 3":0.00832371367224836,"Topic 4":0.0744742247057838,"Topic 5":0.0173412494157936,"Topic 6":0.0139523571009005,"Topic 7":0.0366053258595892,"Topic 8":0.117020350263582,"Topic 9":0.608778254115266,"Topic 10":0.0597357475474689},{"id":"10519980001748","body":"Jim Gibbons: Mr. Speaker, yesterday the announcement was made that an independent counsel will be appointed to investigate Interior Secretary, Bruce Babbitt.

I think the President must think the American people are stupid. For 7\\1/2\\ years we have had two oilmen in the White House, with Republican majorities in Congress for 6 years, and we have seen gas prices go from $1.46 when President Bush took office to over $4--to about $4 now; it went over $4 at one point--per gallon. Now he would have us believe, after that 7\\1/ 2\\ years--Republican majorities for 6 of those 7\\1/2\\ years and having the oil industry write the energy policy with Vice President Cheney in the White House--now he would have us believe, in fact, that we are responsible for this. It is a good lawyer's game. When you don't have the facts on your side, when you don't have the law on your side, you pound on the table and create a diversion. That is what they have done--tried to create a diversion. The American people are a lot smarter than that. The fact is, Democrats cannot act as we want to on the energy crisis because the Republican Party simply won't allow us. We have a slim majority in the Senate, and by Senate rules, the Republicans can filibuster to require us to get 60 votes for anything. That really means, in essence, for those watching, they have the ability to block any legislation they want, and they have used that power to the hilt. Over 90 times they have used this procedural tactic to block much needed legislation. Even though we are in the midst of an energy crisis, they are still blocking everything. At first they said they were blocking us from our work because they wanted a vote on opening our shores to oil drilling--something I don't support--but the majority leader said OK. We will give you a vote on opening our shores to oil drilling. Then the Republicans said: Oh, that is not good enough either. Instead, they claimed to want to vote on opening the shores to oil drilling, a vote on nuclear power, a vote on oil shale development, a vote on their larger package of proposals, and guess what. The majority leader said earlier this week: OK, you can have a vote on all of that. Yet, somehow, every time the majority leader offers the other side votes on exactly what they want, they keep saying that is not good enough. They simply won't take yes for an answer. I hear their speeches. They all mention speculation. Well, we have had testimony that, in fact, speculation in the marketplace could raise oil by $50 per barrel. We even saw a company that was just taken by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission being charged with having manipulated the marketplace--made $1 million in 11 days and increased gas and oil prices. Yet they won't let us go to speculation. They say one thing, they do another. The big issue they keep talking about is production, but the Republicans don't want production. They simply don't want us to have progress. That is their game plan. They have a political equation, and it is: Don't let anything be achieved. On five separate occasions, they have had the opportunity to vote for energy production. They have had the opportunity to keep the rapidly developing wind and solar industries growing at an accelerated pace, but instead they decide to play politics. The Republican Party doesn't seem to take renewable energy seriously. It is true that renewables are essential for our environment, essential for our economy. What these industries really represent are an opportunity to produce massive amounts of domestic energy cheaply and at least 100,000 new high-paying jobs in America. Now, if you don't think renewables are serious business, just ask landowners in Texas, Minnesota, Iowa, or Wyoming who are, in fact, receiving $3,000 to $5,000 per month for allowing a windmill to be sited on their property or ask oilman T. Boone Pickens, who is plowing billions of dollars of his own money into wind energy and a plan to use renewables to end our addiction to oil. Now, somebody who has made a lot of money in oil doesn't all of a sudden plow billions of dollars of his own money into renewable energy unless he thinks there is going to be a payoff at the end. He understands. In my home State of New Jersey we have windmills in Atlantic City, where the casinos are, generating a lot of electricity. Last year we installed enough turbines to power over 1.5 million homes. The solar power industry is growing at over 40 percent a year. These technologies work. They are working now. They are in high demand. They produce an enormous amount of energy. We need to accelerate and expand that. If we extend the wind and solar tax credits so these industries can continue their rapid growth, we could add 150 gigawatts of installed capacity within 10 years. Now, what does that mean? That means that we would have enough electricity to power over 37 million homes. At that rate, by 2030, we could get over 25 percent of our Nation's electricity from wind and solar power. The package of tax credits that the Republicans continue to block-- blocked again today--represents a solution also for the high price of oil. There is a large tax credit for the purchase of plug-in hybrid vehicles--cars, for example, such as the Chevy Volt, which will be able to run on electricity for the first 40 miles after being plugged in. That means a full three-quarters of all trips--all trips--driven by Americans would not use a drop of gas. If projections by some of the experts hold true, and half the cars on the road in 2030 are plug-in hybrids, we could easily cut our use of oil by 10 percent, and some would suggest that we could even displace much more. And by this time, we would be producing enough renewable energy to power all these cars and still have electricity to spare. If we want cheap gasoline and we want to be free from imported oil, we need to pass the tax credit extensions, and we need to build plug-in hybrids, solar panels, and winds turbines, to name a few. It is that simple. It is time for our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to stop exploiting our energy crisis for big oil's gain and let us vote on the things that will actually produce energy. Instead, they insist on holding up everything for an absurd plan that, according to the Energy Information Agency, will not produce energy at all for 10 years and, in 2030, will only produce enough additional gasoline for the equivalent of a few tablespoons per American car. Let me try to put their plan into perspective. Since April of this year, Americans seeing the high cost of gas have actually reduced their consumption by 800,000 barrels of oil a day more than we did year ago. This is the most significant and sudden drop in oil since the 1970s. But what happened, even though we have reduced 800,000 barrels of oil every day? Prices went up. In recent weeks, in response to record oil prices, Saudi Arabia produced an additional half-million barrels of oil more each day. What happened? Prices went up. So how does the Bush-McCain drilling plan compare to these recent events? Well, based upon the Bush administration Energy Information Agency's own analysis, if we open all our shores to oil production, the first drop of oil would not be seen for almost a decade, and offshore oil production would peak in the year 2030. Then it would peak at only 200,000 barrels a day. So, in fact, if 800,000 barrels a day in reduced consumption combined with an increase of 500,000 barrels a day in extra production hasn't lowered gas prices one bit, it is clear that the production of 200,000 versus a combination of 1.3 million barrels in reduced demand or increased production--200,000 barrels in the year 2030--is going to do absolutely nothing about gas prices. In fact, the Energy Information Agency says that adding those 200,000 barrels per day in production in 2030 will lower the price of gasoline by less than a penny per gallon. Let me repeat that. The Republican production plan to open all our shores to drilling and risk the environmental consequences we saw, for example, in the Gulf of Mexico during Katrina and Rita, with 700,000 gallons of oil spilled and 7 million spilled on land by the facilities that bring that oil to the marketplace, would not lower gas prices but about a penny in 2030. Let's compare these numbers with what renewables have to offer. Remember, if we pass the renewable energy tax extender credits, we could produce massive amounts of electricity from renewable technologies. We hear this constantly being discussed by the Republicans, but they don't let us vote on it. Remember that the tax extenders will help us rapidly deploy plug-in hybrid technology so we can use this electricity for transportation. By some projections, this means that by 2030, the same time period they are drilling off the shore with the risk that comes to a $200 billion coastal economy, we could replace 2 million to 3 million barrels of oil per day with electricity. Compare 2 million to 3 million barrels to a measly 200,000 barrels per day by the drilling. Some, such as the DOE's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, projected we could actually displace 3 times as much, or 6.5 million barrels per day by 2030 versus 200,000 barrels in this big drill, drill, drill. I don't quite get it. You can save the equivalent of 6.5 million barrels every day in energy by pursuing the renewables that they say they support but don't vote for or you can have 200,000 versus 6.5 million by virtue of drilling 30 years from now. So this, of course, means that for us to achieve this, we need to get beyond the Republican efforts to stop us from maintaining the tax incentives we have. It means we actually have to get serious about our energy policies and start a serious effort to run our transportation fleet on electricity. That is what voters have to decide on this fall. Do they want to vote for the party of big oil, the party that saw the dramatic increase in gas over the administration's lifetime, where they wro","word.count":2154,"sep11":7.06179775280899,"years":2008.92134831461,"days":4956,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0139562216120497,"Topic 2":0.0369576455848947,"Topic 3":0.0243351985921396,"Topic 4":0.264109785378394,"Topic 5":0.00387438529437792,"Topic 6":0.00911939471117218,"Topic 7":0.00580383131335638,"Topic 8":0.121478462739427,"Topic 9":0.499317839386045,"Topic 10":0.0210472353881424},{"id":"10419950115810","body":"Frank Lautenberg: I thank the Senator from California for her willingness to give me just a couple minutes.

But the fact is when that committee began to move forward to produce such a bill which provided those increases for education, they were cut off at the pass by the most reactionary elements in the majority party caucus. Those elements went to leadership and said, if you appropriate one dime for education above the President's budget, we are going to bring down the labor, health, education bill. They further said that, until you produce an education funding level freeze at the level of last year for education, that they would not support any other appropriation bills. That is why we are wrapped around the axle. Let me continue with other categories. Title I, the No Child Left Behind Act promised that we would have an increase in funding of at least $4 billion this year. Instead, they got a $1 billion increase financed by other cuts in other education programs aimed at the same children. Then if we take a look at handicapped education, we increased them annually by over $1 billion over the last 3 years. We wanted to do so again on a bipartisan basis, both sides of the aisle.

I think there is too much violence for all of us. But constitutionally, not being able to, that would be one particular defect, as I see it, in the approach that has been brought out in hearings heretofore, and hearings heretofore incidentally back in 1993 that we had the present Attorney General study S. 470, which is now before our committee, a bill by Senator Inouye, myself, and others. And Attorney General Reno attested to the fact that she thought it would definitely pass constitutional muster. There is another feature with respect to this--and I am not just nit- picking because, if they call the amendment and we vote it, I would still vote for the amendment, I say to the Senator. Do not worry about that. But what happens is you have a fee in here, also. When we had a fee 2 years ago, Senator Bentsen--no, this was 4 years ago, because 2 years ago he was the Secretary of Treasury--but 4 years ago when we had a similar hearing, he said, ``Wait a minute, the fee belongs in the Finance Committee,'' and someone later on would raise that point. I would still vote for it. There are these kinds of misgivings. I remember the distinguished chairman of the Communications Subcommittee on the House side--the distinguished Presiding Officer would know and be familiar with the honorable Congressman Ed Markey, of Massachusetts. He had what he called then the V-chip. They are calling this the choice chip. He ran into these similar problems. But it is not my argument. So we have had problems. Like I said, how long, America, are we going to consider and do nothing because there is a problem for every solution? I would prefer--it would be up to the sponsors of the bill; I am confident our distinguished chairman would prefer--to take these perfecting amendments, with a matter of a fee there, and otherwise, to have a hearing on this and guarantee we will bring out a bill of some kind that we think is constitutional. I do not want them to think it is a putoff. I do know there is an inherent danger here that I immediately feel, having been in this particular discipline now for a long time. I started off last week in the opening statement I made that evening--I think it was last Wednesday evening--that any particular entity or discipline in communications has the power to block the bill. I can see the broadcasters, when they see fees, running around trying to block this bill. That, again, is not necessarily a valid argument against the amendments of the Senators from North Dakota and Connecticut. But there are these inherent dangers that immediately arise. I can think of several others. I have the opportunity to distinguish what we have pending before the committee. I implore the authors to go along with it, but if they want to vote, I am convinced the majority leader is ready to vote for them. Is it the desire of these Senators, irregardless, as my Congressman Rivers used to say down home, irregardless, you are going to want to vote one way or the other, period, because I do not know whether it is our duty to argue further, I say to the chairman. I yield the floor.","word.count":797,"sep11":-6.41011235955056,"years":1995.44943820225,"days":160,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.00752460947798632,"Topic 2":0.122284735084751,"Topic 3":0.106617049320628,"Topic 4":0.00879587574330664,"Topic 5":0.0412965263857288,"Topic 6":0.0157057853575979,"Topic 7":0.647002018928809,"Topic 8":0.00781300386480938,"Topic 9":0.0402100292660973,"Topic 10":0.00275036657028558},{"id":"11020070007345","body":"Jeff Miller: As I look at your chart, it occurs to me that that's Federal spending.

I rise to honor the work of activist, legendary civil rights leader, the Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth. For more than 60 years, Reverend Shuttlesworth has fought passionately for racial equality and social justice in our great country. Born in Birmingham, AL, Reverend Shuttlesworth became involved in the civil rights movement as a young pastor. He organized sit-ins and boycotts. He challenged the injustice for decades of Birmingham's Jim Crow laws, despite attempts on his life, and there were many by the Ku Klux Klan. In spite of repeated arrests, attacks by police dogs and firehoses, Reverend Shuttlesworth simply refused to back down. In 1957, Reverend Shuttlesworth joined the efforts with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Ralph Abernathy to form the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Members of the SCLC fought side by side to increase educational opportunities, to promote voter registration, and to promoting equality of opportunity for African Americans throughout the country. In 1961, Reverend Shuttlesworth took up the pastorate of Revelation Baptist Church in Cincinnati, OH, and continued his campaign for racial justice. Bringing the same fearless opposition to segregation he had displayed in Birmingham, he joined forces with other Black ministers to make William Lovelace the city's first African-American judge. For greater than a half century, Reverend Shuttlesworth spoke out against injustice. He has worked to increase minority representation in city government, he has expanded minority hiring by the local police department, and worked to improve access to housing in Over-the-Rhine, an area of Cincinnati, for needy families and throughout Hamilton County. Reverend Shuttlesworth has made great personal sacrifice, risking his life, risking his own health and the health of his family, so every American, without regard to race, would have access to equal opportunity to succeed. I announced my campaign for the Senate in 2005 at the church of Reverend Shuttlesworth in Cincinnati. I consider him a friend. I have met him many times over the last 15 or so years. He took me one day to a small room in his church, a room he called a museum. It was a room dedicated to the civil rights movement. It had so many wonderful examples of his courage, his bravery, his accomplishments, and the accomplishments of so many people he worked with to promote social justice, to promote economic justice, to promote civil and human rights. For that, I am especially proud of Reverend Shuttlesworth. I am especially proud of the role he plays in Cincinnati, always battling for racial justice. I am proud the Birmingham, AL, airport has named their international airport after the Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.","word.count":465,"sep11":7.06460674157303,"years":2008.92415730337,"days":4957,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0322872108377623,"Topic 2":0.0363833727300395,"Topic 3":0.0112933355454014,"Topic 4":0.0163258002890754,"Topic 5":0.0485424666151779,"Topic 6":0.0268268290434946,"Topic 7":0.734275039934521,"Topic 8":0.0704785931098564,"Topic 9":0.00389039674101384,"Topic 10":0.0196969551536581},{"id":"10820030072750","body":"Jon Corzine: Mr. President, I rise to honor the magnificent life, and the legacy, of Celia Cruz, and to introduce legislation to award her posthumously our Nation's highest civilian award, the Congressional Gold Medal. This award would be an appropriate tribute to Ms. Cruz's life, given her innumerable accomplishments in the world of entertainment, her work as an ambassador of Latino culture, and her many contributions to American society. Celia de la Caridad Cruz Alonso was born on October 21 during the 1920's. She died on July 17, 2003, at her home in Fort Lee, NJ. Over a prolific 50-year career as an entertainer, Celia Cruz, the ``Queen of Salsa,'' recorded more than 50 albums. Each was a showcase of her talent, flair, and the passion she brought to her work. Her collaborative efforts ranged from work with legendary salsa artist Tito Puente, pop star David Byrne, and hip-hop producer Wyclef Jean. Through those cross-cultural efforts, Cruz's music reached over four generations of fans, and helped break down ethnic and cultural barriers. Celia Cruz's gifts as an entertainer were recognized throughout the world, and she won hundreds of awards, most notably a 1990 Grammy Award and Billboard Magazine's ``Lifetime Achievement Award'' in 1995. In 1994, Ms. Cruz was recognized by President Clinton with a National Endowment of the Arts award. While best known for her work as an entertainer, Celia Cruz was much more than a singer to her fans, especially to Latinos in America. She touched the lives of millions. The outpouring of sorrow that accompanied the news of her passing underscores that point. More than 100,000 people turned out to pay their respect, and honor the memory of Celia Cruz at her wake in Miami, FL. More than 75,000 people lined the streets of Manhattan--some crying, many singing and fondly recalling Ms. Cruz's life--as her funeral procession made its way from the St. Patrick's Cathedral. The enormous outpouring of support that accompanied news of the death of Celia Cruz provides some indication about the special nature of this amazing woman. Her story is that of a girl from meager means in Havana, Cuba who eventually grew up to become a ``queen.'' Celia Cruz was one of 14 children raised in Havana's Santa Suarez district. As a child, she could be heard by neighbors as she sung her siblings to sleep. She received her first award in a competition on the talent show La Hora Del Te on Radio Garcia Serra, in which she won first prize. Her first break came in 1950 when she took over as the lead singer with Cuba's Sonora Matancera. Cruz's first recording was a 78 rpm single released with Sonora Matancera in January 1951, entitled ``Cao Cao Mani Picao''. On July 15, 1960, Cruz and members of her band fled Cuba for the United States, to escape the regime of Fidel Castro. They were able to get out by convincing Castro's officials that the group was simply going on another tour abroad. Enraged by the singer's choice to pursue freedom, Castro never forgave Cruz for this and refused to let Celia return to Cuba--even as her mother was sick and when her father passed away. In the 60's, Celia Cruz and Pedro Knight, her husband and a member of the band, decided to make America their permanent home and Celia Cruz became a citizen of the United States. During that time, Celia Cruz transformed from a gifted, charismatic Cuban-American singer to a woman who would become the ``Queen of Salsa.'' In 1966, she teamed up with the legendary Tito Puente and together they released eight albums. Although her classic style, the origins of salsa, did not immediately appeal to Latin youth during the 1960's, Celia Cruz returned with a vengeance after a stint in the Operetta ``Hommy,'' in the early 1970's. By 1973, Latin pride had begun to take hold in American cities with large Latino communities--particularly in New York, New Jersey and Florida. In New York, Latin musicians had begun to mix classical musical styles from Puerto Rico, such as Bomba and Plena, with classical musical styles from Cuba, such as Mambo and Son, combining them with the trombone for a more urban sound. This combination created what is now known as salsa--and Celia Cruz was a pioneer of the genre. Ms. Cruz signed with Fania Records, one of the major salsa record labels of the time, and in the summer of '74 released Celia &amp; Johnny, the first in a series of collaborations with Johnny Pacheco. Building upon the success of these albums, Cruz then recorded albums with other top leaders on the Fania roster, like Willie Colon, Papo Lucca and Ray Barretto, whose bands each had their own trademark sound. She toured with the Fania until 1988. While Latin music has historically been predominately dominated by male artists the talent of Celia Cruz could not be ignored. Her flamboyant clothing, charismatic presence, proud voice and her trademark ``Azuuuuuuuuuuuuucar!'' tag line became legendary. In addition to her lucrative recording career, Cruz also had roles in several American films such as Salsa, the Mambo Kings and the Perez Family. She was a true pioneer. As I mentioned earlier, Celia Cruz received hundreds of awards as a result of her contributions to music, most notable the Grammy Award and the National Endowment of the Arts Award from President Clinton. Her contributions to society and her contributions to Latino culture have also been well recognized. Among those the Presidential Medal in Arts from the Republic of Colombia and the Hispanic Heritage Award's Lifetime Achievement Award. Other notable recognitions bestowed upon Ms. Cruz include an honorary Doctorate of Music from Yale, a star on Hollywood's ``Walk of Fame,'' and the keys to the cities of Union City, NJ; Miami, FL; Dallas, TX; and New York City. Those recognitions are all noteworthy, and the life of Celia Cruz warrants each and every one of them. But of the hundreds of awards won by Celia Cruz, there is one award that she did not receive, but most certainly deserves the Congressional Gold Medal. This award is considered our Nation's highest civilian honor, and has been awarded to a rare and esteemed group of individuals. Notable recipients include George Washington, Sir Winston Churchill, Bob Hope, Robert Frost, Joe Louis, Mother Teresa, and most recently Tony Blair. The standards for considering legislation authorizing Congressional Gold Medal state that, among other things, ``the recipient shall have performed an achievement that has an impact on American history and culture that is likely to be recognized as a major achievement in the recipient's field long after that achievement.'' Celia Cruz, music pioneer and the acknowledged ``Queen of Salsa,'' certainly fits the criteria to receive the Congressional Gold Medal. Celia Cruz, ambassador of Latin culture, impassioned voice of freedom, and American is what the Congressional Gold Medal is about. This award would properly honor the legacy, and the life, of Celia Cruz. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation, and ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:","word.count":1197,"sep11":1.92415730337079,"years":2003.78370786517,"days":3127,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.144288899845241,"Topic 2":0.101457500954286,"Topic 3":0.0133717797360748,"Topic 4":0.389851080987647,"Topic 5":0.00609301575118456,"Topic 6":0.10419906413796,"Topic 7":0.0508062618449691,"Topic 8":0.0225107501242908,"Topic 9":0.0951595363734537,"Topic 10":0.0722621102448938},{"id":"10820030013793","body":"Butch Otter: Mr. Speaker, on the occasion of Memorial Day, I rise to recognize a fallen soldier from my district, First Lieutenant David R.

Although I never had the opportunity to know Lieutenant Bernstein, what I have read about his life demonstrates what a tremendous and exemplary young man he was. He was a member of the West Point swim team for his 4 years at the United States Military Academy and enjoyed running, bicycling and competing in triathlons. He was also an accomplished student as exhibited by his selection as his high school valedictorian at Phoenixville High School and finishing fifth in his class at West Point.

My expectation is, most of our colleagues will understand that this, as a follow-on to the Freedom to Farm bill, is not progress but in fact it retards the opportunity for family farmers in this country to make a living. I say to Senator Conrad, one of the things I want to ask is: Our country now is trying to find out how we provide a lift to the American economy because we had a very soft economy prior to these terrible terrorist acts that occurred on September 11. The economy was very soft and troubled going into that point. But, in fact, the farm economy, the economy in which family farmers live, has been soft and troubled and collapsing for 4, 5 years. So when you talk about giving a lift to the American economy, family farmers out there on the land have been working through a virtual depression for 4, 5 years now. It is interesting; we are talking about two things in Congress: One is a stimulus plan to try to lift the economy, and the second is security. In both cases, it seems to me, these proposals fail. Stimulus. This isn't going to be a stimulus. This is going to be a lodestone. It is going to weigh down further family farmers. The family farmers have been foot soldiers for this country's economy for a long while. They produce the best food, at the lowest price, for consumers around the world. We are lucky to have them and ought to be proud of them, but they are being bled by an economy that says our food has no value, even as half a billion people around the world are desperately hungry. But the point I want to make is, the Senator talked about Europe. Europe understands food. Europe understands it from another point, which is the other thing we are working on: Security. Part of the issue of food is security. Introduce bioterrorism agents into the food supply and you have really big trouble. How do you do that? Perhaps as a national newscast talked about recently, in a feedlot containing 200,000 cattle. That is why a broad network of family farms, disbursed across our country, represents security of America's food supply. So there is a significant security interest here that the Europeans have understood for a long while that we ought to start understanding. Finally, I make the point that the Senator talks about the bill introduction that the President says he now supports. That bill is a bill that offers 5 feet of rope to somebody drowning in 10 feet of water. Thanks for the gesture, but it is really insignificant and does not matter very much. What we have to do with the leadership of Senator Conrad, myself, and others who care about the future of family farmers, is to take what the House of Representatives passed--which is better than this, I might say, and better than current law--and then add to it higher loan rates for wheat, higher loan rates for barley, and a series of other things that really make it a bill that is friendly to family farms. I am talking now about families who produce America's food supply. I was not going to speak to this, but I heard Senator Conrad make some comments. He is right on the mark; assertive, strong, but right on the mark on these issues. I am proud to work with him on these matters. This is life or death for the economic and financial future of many families who have invested their hopes and dreams on a farmstead somewhere in the Dakotas or up and down the heartland of the country.","word.count":642,"sep11":0.103932584269663,"years":2001.96348314607,"days":2479,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.299964095022033,"Topic 2":0.269490363769362,"Topic 3":0.00985953394315597,"Topic 4":0.0230505418005066,"Topic 5":0.146521797329143,"Topic 6":0.147022931483525,"Topic 7":0.00445499354416982,"Topic 8":0.0773323136533311,"Topic 9":0.0149228203738693,"Topic 10":0.00738060908090326},{"id":"10419960012003","body":"Sander M.

I didn't come prepared to answer these questions, but I actually think I am prepared to answer them. The remarks with regard to the need to balance the budget. I agree, and I have a plan to balance this budget. I don't want to balance it by raising taxes. I want to balance this budget by controlling our spending. That is the issue. That is what the American people want. That is what I want. That is what we would do if we were a family balancing our budget or a small business balancing our budget or a large business balancing our budget. We would take a look at our spending. Of course, we would work on the revenue side. Our revenue side has been growing. It grew 14.5 percent more than anticipated last year because we kept the taxes down. So I would suggest my colleagues on the other side of the aisle join with me. I will be introducing a piece of legislation. It is called the CUT legislation, which means cut unnecessary tab. Cut the unnecessary tab of this Federal Government. It is going to be a new process that has never been offered to this Congress before, Mr. Speaker. It is a process that will allow for a privileged motion to come to the floor under an open rule that would be a rescissions bill once every quarter. Once every quarter, leadership will have the first 10 days of each quarter to offer a recissions bill. If they do not do that, any Member can offer a rescissions bill under a privileged motion. And if the Speaker recognizes them, they can bring forward a shell bill or a bill that has a thousand cuts in it, for that matter, but it will allow every single line item that has been appropriated by this Congress to be brought back before this Congress and removed from the budget under rescissions. When an appropriation bills leaves the House and goes to the Senate, and the Senate works their will on the appropriation bill and it comes back to conference and we agree and do final passage on an appropriation bill, it then goes to the President for his signature. From the instant that that bill is enacted, and generally from the instant that the President's signature and ink goes on that bill, it will be subject then to rescissions that will happen four times a year in this Congress. Four times a year Congress will take up a rescissions bill, and it will allow any Member to bring an amendment that will be ruled in order, provided it is in the proper sequence in the structure of the rescissions bill, which will allow actually for rescissions of all appropriations that have gone out that haven't been expended. So every Member then will have that opportunity to have their attempt at a line item veto. And when that budget is done and when the expenditures are spent, then a majority of this Congress will have had their say on every single line item. If they object to a particular issue, like say, for example the Cowgirls Hall of Fame would be one that comes to mind, they would simply bring an amendment that would be added to the rescissions bill, put it up, debate the amendment, and we would vote that amendment up or down. If the amendment succeeds and it is to strike the funding for the Cowgirls Hall of Fame, then that would become part of the rescissions bill that would come off this floor, presumably pass and go over to the Senate for them to act on it. Now, whether they do or not is an open question as well, Mr. Speaker. But certainly the public would put some pressure on the Senate to do the right thing and do the responsible thing. That is one way to control earmarks. It would allow Congress to address every single earmark and rescind, if they chose, those earmarks that are not appropriate spending. So the pork and the fat that is in the bill, particularly the appropriations that come in in conference that don't have a vote on the House or the Senate, unless they are part of the overall conference report, those kinds of appropriations then could be singled out in our rescissions bill and we could strike the unnecessary spending. It would be something that would empower the rank-and-file members of this Congress and help them offset some of the powerful tactics of the appropriations people when they sit down in conference and put these appropriations in the bill. It is appropriate. It is something I believe our Founding Fathers would agree with. It is something that will control, to some degree, the overspending of our budget. Now, one can argue that it is entitlements that are the big part of this, and I will agree. Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and interest, those four items, are swallowing up more than half of our budget. Our discretionary portion of the budget is getting smaller and smaller. But we can still address the overspending in our discretionary budget. And this doesn't mean we can't address our entitlements. I am for going down that path of addressing the entitlements too, Mr. Speaker. Now, my CUT bill will be introduced sometime in the next 2 weeks, and that means Cut the Unnecessary Tab of Congress. It is new. I think it is unique. I do not think anything has ever been offered like this in Congress before. I don't want to go so far as to say that it is revolutionary, but I will go so far as to say that I believe it is necessary. It is necessary for us to shine some sunshine on the things we do here in this Congress and let the people see how we do business, and put people up in this Congress for a vote so we can read their voting record and determine where they really stand. So these kind of nights when you hear this rhetoric go on over and over and over again, that we are spending too much money and we are irresponsible and the national debt is going up and up and up and up, I would say to the people that have been making those statements night after night down here, what is your plan? What plan do you propose, other than raising taxes? You are talking like we don't respond to you. We respond to you. I am responding to you right now and asking you to join me in my CUT bill. We will do something responsible. We will slow down Federal spending and make everybody in this Congress accountable, to have a vote on potentially every single line item in the entire $2.7 trillion budget. That is a responsible thing for us to do, and I am asking for support on both sides of the aisle. I actually think there will be some significant Democrat support on the other side of the aisle, and I am confident there will be significant support here on the Republican side of the aisle. That is one thing we can do. Now, this foreign debt issue. Well, foreign debt just comes two ways. One is if we have deficit spending and then we are borrowing to keep this government going. All of that debt isn't foreign debt. A percentage of it is, and I have seen the numbers. It isn't a shocking piece that is foreign debt. But we have foreign countries that invest in U.S. Treasury bills because they believe in our currency. So you can declare that to be foreign debt, and I won't deny it. And I am not comfortable with an ever-growing foreign debt. Another way we can get foreign debt is to have a negative balance of trade. A year ago it was a minus $617.7 billion in a negative balance of trade. A lot of that is because of oil and another big chunk of it is because of China. Those two things added together, I believe, are nearing about $400 billion between those two categories all together. That was a year ago, minus $617.7 billion. This last year, it was just reported out a month or a little more ago, a minus $725 billion imbalance in trade deficit. So whenever we come with a trade deficit, that means that there are companies and countries, foreign companies and foreign countries that will hold collateral of the United States. We buy more than we sell, so that deficit becomes collateralized in collateral here in the United States. I know at one point the Japanese owned Rockefeller Plaza. So that would be an example. They have since sold it, but that kind of collateral is held here in this country and it grows: $725 billion. This kind of growth rate of our trade deficit, we are approaching that point where it will be $1 trillion a year. And if you do $1 trillion a year for 10 years, you have got, miraculously, $10 trillion in debt. These numbers continue to grow. It can't go on forever. We need to reverse that. Unlike my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I have a plan to address that as well. And it is not a difficult plan to understand. It is one that serious economists will not disagree with, and it is called the fair tax. The fair tax is a national consumption tax. And what it does is it recognizes that what you tax, you get less of. Well, we're taxing all productivity in America under this policy that we have today under the Internal Revenue Code: The corporate income tax and the individual income tax and all of the taxes we have that roll around that. I propose under the FAIR Tax, H.R. 25, to take all tax off productivity in America. Ronald Reagan said what you tax you get less of. So I want to take all tax off of all productivity. We will more than double the economy in this country in 10 to 15 years. If we do that and put the tax on consumption, then we are providing the incentive for savings and investment. To take the earnings, put it in savings and investment. People will decide when they will pay the taxes. But the important part is to untax productivity so we get more productivity. When that happens, gross domestic product jumps and doubles. People have 56 percent more money in their pockets because we are not withholding from their paycheck and they go out into the retail businesses and spend money. The tax is collected there, and it comes into the national treasury and","word.count":5879,"sep11":4.67977528089888,"years":2006.5393258427,"days":4108,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.885300920434384,"Topic 2":0.0374173881360242,"Topic 3":0.00824343922134951,"Topic 4":0.0192918543454985,"Topic 5":0.00799658963899327,"Topic 6":0.00894610487798861,"Topic 7":0.00642803613657816,"Topic 8":0.0143727673702551,"Topic 9":0.00852406356903352,"Topic 10":0.00347883626989498},{"id":"10519980056049","body":"Judd Gregg: I rise today to discuss efforts that were made to insert assumptions into the Budget Resolution that would hurt the Commerce, Justice, State, and Judiciary Subcommittee. Those assumptions sought to amend the securities legislation that we negotiated with the Senate Banking Committee and House Commerce Committee in 1996. Specifically, they assume reductions in NASDAQ transaction fees. The result being that the Appropriations Committee pick up the cost of $73 million. Prior to 1996, the 6 fees were paid by corporations to register securities. Some interests felt that the 6 fees had grown too large. During negotiations with the White House and the authorizing committees it was agreed that over the next ten years 6 fees would be reduced. The creation of the NASDAQ transaction fees was a concession made to the CJS subcommittee as part of a larger compromise that led to a phasing out of the Section 6 registration fees. The intent was to minimize the impact on the Appropriations process. Since 1934, Section 31 transaction fees had been imposed on exchange listed securities but not on those sold in the Over the Counter market. As part of the agreement in 1996, extending the section 31 fee to the OTC market allowed the 6 registration fees to be reduced while retaining adequate fee collections to support and offset the SEC's appropriation. In arriving at the compromise that resulted in the ten year funding mechanism, it was acknowledged that surpluses over the SEC's funding would likely exist until the end of the ten year schedule.

I stated that this amendment language is based on a very big precedent established in 1992 in this body with a joint committee of Members of Congress to look at the rules in both Houses, to look at the processes in both Houses. There is a precedent. There is not a problem with the debate clause. I think that is not a prudent argument to be against this. The Justice Department will eventually get this if, in fact, we find out there was a crime. I also make the point that nobody knows right now where this occurred. At least I don't. Nobody knows what the facts are, so the assumption we are making that we would be involved in investigating the House is--we do not know that. At least I certainly do not know it, and I have kind of been looking at this for quite some time. So it is an assumption that we are going to have, necessarily, an investigation of the House. We may be having an investigation of the Senate. The fact is, we have a good precedent for this. This was a Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress, H. Con. Res. 192, in the 102nd, and it looked at everything. It didn't just look at one specific thing. So there is precedent for it. More important is the separation of powers issue. What we are saying to the American public is we do not have the power to control our own body and that we have to ask the Justice Department to come in and do it. If there is a criminal violation, they certainly ought to be involved in that, but we do not know that yet. First of all, these are the rules of the Senate. They are not law. We are asking them to investigate the rules of the Senate, not a law; therefore, we are giving power to the executive branch, we are asking the executive branch to come in. My great worry--there is no question, Senator Boxer's amendment will do this. It will get an investigation, if they will come and do it--there is no way we can force them to come and do it--and we will get to the bottom of it. But I am worried about the integrity of the body, saying to the American public that we cannot police ourselves; we cannot do it; we do not want to take the heavy lifting it is going to take. And I do not believe a four-by-four panel of two Democratic Senators, two Republican Senators, two Democratic Congressmen, and two Republican Congressmen-- and this committee has the right to not do any of this in public if they do not want to. The committee totally gets to do this. Nobody wants a circus. I am even reticent that I am actually here making this point. I think it is a pox on our body that this happened, but I think it needs to be addressed. My hope is that people will not take a partisan viewpoint on how they vote. My hope is they will think about the institution of Congress, they will think about the separation of powers, they will think about the difference between laws and rules of the Senate and rules of the Congress. Then, if a referral needs to be made to the Justice Department, we would do that, but that would most appropriately come from our Ethics Committees, not from this committee--after a referral from this committee to the Ethics Committee. The chair of the Ethics Committee cannot say whether they are looking at this right now. They may be. They may not be. We do not know. The Justice Department cannot say whether they are or not. So we do not know what is happening. The point is, something needs to happen. I worry that when we tell the American public we are not capable of looking into our own dysfunction, that, in fact, what it says is that we give up power to the Justice Department to look at how we enroll bills and whether we violated the rules under how we do it. I have a real concern with that. I have tremendous concern with that, especially since we made such a large issue of separation of powers in this Congress. I will make one other point, and it is not to demean the Senator from California. If this were important to the committee, why was your amendment not part of the committee mark? If, in fact, the committee was enraged over this, why was this not a part of the original committee mark?","word.count":787,"sep11":6.76685393258427,"years":2008.62640449438,"days":4851,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.426269403160949,"Topic 2":0.183339453928442,"Topic 3":0.0116269632674045,"Topic 4":0.0241469915628951,"Topic 5":0.0371720517080729,"Topic 6":0.0219186328166711,"Topic 7":0.00755923282096174,"Topic 8":0.0702810972449436,"Topic 9":0.0425245488012243,"Topic 10":0.175161624688437},{"id":"10820030056850","body":"Dick Durbin: Mr. President, I yield myself 8 minutes My amendment would condition the acquisition of interceptors 21 through 30 for the ground-based midcourse national missile defense system on the implementation of operational evaluation and testing under the auspices of the director of testing in the Pentagon. I will try to give a brief explanation of where we are with this system that is to be deployed. It is a combination of existing elements and some brandnew technology. The existing elements, first, the defense support system, a satellite system, is a cold war system designed to pick up the initial lift-off of missiles. That is in place. Then there is a group of Aegis ships that are out around the potential threat area of North Korea. That is a relatively new application of these ships. They were designed to intercept and detect cruise missiles and aircraft. Now we are attempting to expand that to track, at least partially, the flight path of an ICBM coming from a threat, specifically North Korea. Then there is the Cobra Dane radar, an older radar system. It is not particularly well adapted at discriminating, so it is therefore not the best radar we could have. The administration has canceled the X-band radar system, which is better. Then there are the interceptors with the kill vehicles on top. The subject of this amendment is the interceptors. For many years, this ground-based system was designed to deploy 20 interceptors. Today, we are taking five for this deployment. But 20 was a rather significant number for technology that has not yet been proven. What the administration did this year is say, well, we want to go beyond that 20; we want 40. We want to buy 10 more, 21 through 30, and have long lead-time acquisition funds for 31 through 40. Well, the Congress in its wisdom already terminated the long lead time for 21 through 40, but we still have to budget this money for 21 through 30. I don't propose to take that money away. I want to simply fence it, make as a condition to spend that money that this system will begin testing and evaluation. We had a vigorous debate about imposing this operational testing scheme. The result was now the Secretary of Defense is required to promulgate some criteria for operational testing and conduct these tests by October of 2005. My amendment differs, and I think significantly so. It says we cannot depend upon the Defense Secretary's criteria and evaluation--a self- evaluation by the Missile Defense Agency. We need to get this program back into the traditional system of operational testing and evaluation, which is conducted by an independent agency in the Pentagon which designs, supervises the tests, and makes sure the tests will do what we want to do: deliver to the field a system that actually works. I don't think it is unreasonable. In fact, I think it is entirely appropriate to say that before we buy these additional interceptors--10 more--we are at least in a situation where this rudimentary system has been entered into operational testing. Let me specifically highlight the issue of the interceptors. The operation of the interceptor and kill vehicle is brand new. Neither has been tested in an interceptor test. We have not tried to fly them with a kill vehicle even against a target. Yet we are buying 10 more of them. It would be prudent to say let's wait and at least do a few tests with these new interceptors and kill vehicles. The new version of the kill vehicle, by the way, where the warhead would actually impact the incoming enemy missile, has never even been flight tested. We don't know what it will look like. In fact, problems with the kill vehicle have delayed the scheduled flight test from March until July 31 of this year; and, frankly, we are weeks away from that and it is entirely plausible that this would be delayed even further. So we are deploying a system in which we have not yet even tested in flight one of the most critical aspects of the system, let alone the fact that the rest of the system has been cobbled together by existing pieces of technology being used in new ways. That is a strong argument, in my mind, to say how serious are we about saying this is deployment. But it is more compelling, in my mind, to say at some point we have to get operational testing and evaluation--not some improvised form by the Secretary of Defense being implemented by the Missile Defense Agency but a traditional system where the director of test and evaluation at the Pentagon does evaluation and testing. This amendment would do that. It would take no money away. It would simply say we cannot spend the money on the next 10 interceptors--21 through 30--until we have entered the traditional mode of operational test and evaluation. This amendment makes a great deal of sense. There are examples of how useful operational testing is. The Patriot PAC-3 system--probably the closest analogy to this, even though it is a theater missile system--is designed to go against targets that are not as fast and don't leave the atmosphere. But it is the same hit-to-kill technology. In fact, I was bemused years ago when they would show the film clips of how successful we are in this new technology, and they would use PAC-3 film clips about the hit-to-kill technology. The PAC-3 system was being tested developmentally. Then it went into operational testing and it failed four consecutive operational tests against a realistic target, one in which you try to simulate the conditions of battlefield use. Even though it was successful in the developmental tests, it failed four consecutive operational tests. Why are we buying missiles today that have the potential of duplicating the PAC-3 experience? Frankly, we could be in the unenviable position where the first time we try to fly this against a potentially real target, it fails. We have to have operational testing and the PAC-3 is a very good example. These operational tests are extremely useful in finally coming up with a system that is much more reliable. So, as a result, I urge my amendment strongly. It doesn't take the money away. It simply lays out as a condition that we not spend it until we at least have operational testing. By the way, we are already buying 20 missiles. I reserve the remainder of my time.","word.count":5609,"sep11":1.6123595505618,"years":2003.47191011236,"days":3016,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0949212489171093,"Topic 2":0.0313806432373894,"Topic 3":0.0120550908220297,"Topic 4":0.028939809099164,"Topic 5":0.00499532358852696,"Topic 6":0.00956166788905268,"Topic 7":0.429556692331122,"Topic 8":0.069573939173544,"Topic 9":0.314088891321347,"Topic 10":0.0049266936207145},{"id":"10720020010633","body":"Gene Taylor: Reclaiming my time, Mr. Chairman, I would tell the gentleman that that is a sham, and the sham is that the Republican Party paid down public debt.

The United States has not had a nonproliferation policy, per se. As a matter of fact, if we look at the administration, this administration has moved to build new nuclear weapons called bunker busters. They have moved to discourage efforts at nuclear disarmament. They have, in the first days of their administration, canceled the antiballistic treaty with Russia. This administration does not have a commitment to nonproliferation, and the world knows that. Iran knows that. That is why it is very difficult for us to be able to simultaneously discourage Iran from acquiring nuclear technology, and at the same time speak to the imperative of a bilateral progress with India. The United States has to have a consistent policy with respect to nuclear nonproliferation. This country cannot speak out of one side of its mouth and tell Iran and North Korea, don't you dare go in that direction, don't you dare try to acquire nuclear technology, because we cannot see whether you can separate civilian and military, and on the other hand give a blessing to that same kind of an arrangement with a country that, yes, we have a great relationship with; yes, it is the longest and the oldest democracy in the world; yes, there is a lot to be said about the people in the Indian Government being responsible people. My point here is not in any way to diminish the role that India has in trying to develop social and technological progress in the world, but it is to speak to our responsibility as citizens of the United States to ask: What is the impact of any agreement that we have with India on the rest of the world? And I would say that with this administration not being willing to talk to Iran with respect to Iran's nuclear ambitions, with this administration not being ready to talk to North Korea with respect to North Korea's nuclear ambitions, this is a dangerous time to be approving such an agreement, because it will be seen as a license to other countries which have nuclear ambitions to proceed whether they are talking to the United States or not. The imperative of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty at its inception was not to manage proliferation, but it was to do away with all nuclear weapons. Read the treaty. We are at a moment in human history where we have not found a way to be able to resolve our differences without war. Witness the failed policies of this administration with respect to Iraq. Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction, but we chose to attract Iraq anyway. Policies of unilateralism, of first strike breed the same kind of policies around the world. It is premature for us to be promoting an agreement with India when we have not shown the capacity as a Nation to take a direction which prizes diplomacy, which shows that we can use the science of human relations to be able to avert conflict. We have to show a capacity to demonstrate that war is not inevitable; we have not done that. And so when we are on the threshold of approving a new nuclear agreement with India, notwithstanding our good relations with that country, we cannot do that without looking at the impact that will have on the rest of the world.","word.count":750,"sep11":4.26685393258427,"years":2006.12640449438,"days":3961,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.133617751148756,"Topic 2":0.0612832805040517,"Topic 3":0.00143531049334231,"Topic 4":0.698648540718933,"Topic 5":0.00172580809296384,"Topic 6":0.0017770367327028,"Topic 7":0.0014919123134062,"Topic 8":0.00179004054828769,"Topic 9":0.0949321943956576,"Topic 10":0.00329812505189834},{"id":"10620000009018","body":"Benjamin Gilman: Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr. Speaker, this resolution is extraordinarily important for the people of Belarus, for their liberty and their freedom. I want to thank our ranking minority member on the Committee on International Relations, the gentleman from Connecticut , for introducing this measure which calls it like it really is in Belarus, pointing out quite simply that the regime of Belarusan President Alyaksandr Lukashenka is unconstitutional and illegitimate. It points out that the Lukashenka regime uses the very worst of Soviet-style tactics to repress political opposition and democratic government and to deny the people of Belarus their fundamental human rights. It points out that the Lukashenka regime is, in short, nothing less than a dictatorship, pure and simple. Mr. Speaker, I have been pleased to join the ranking member as an original sponsor of this resolution, not just for those important reasons, but because it also points to some very troubling facts with regard to the foreign policy of Belarus' neighbor, Russia. First, as this measure notes, the Government of Russia has been pursuing a reunification with Belarus and is actively pursuing such reunification just as we speak. Such a reunification is inappropriate and I believe an affront under international law for the following reasons: The president of the Belarusan parliament is an illegitimate one, having been dissolved by the President, and no such negotiations should be conducted with it or, much less, agreements ratified with it. Any such reunification of results in Russia extending its military nuclear forces to cover Belarus would, I believe, be a violation of Belarus status as a nonnuclear state under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Mr. Speaker, the second important point raised by this resolution regarding Russia is the fact that Russia has been providing considerable financial support, billions of dollars worth of such support, to that dictatorship in Belarus, and at a time when the Russian government is getting hundreds of millions of dollars in aid from our Nation to pay its costs for reducing its arms under the START- I Treaty, at a time when the Russian government is seeking billions of dollars in debt forgiveness from foreign governments, including our own Nation, at a time when the Russian government has received billions of dollars in loans from international financial institutions, and at a time when our Nation is turning over to the Russian government hundreds of millions of dollars in monies earned from the sale of donated American food in Russia, it is nothing less than shocking that the Russian government is spending millions of dollars to support a brutal dictatorship in Belarus and to fight a war in Chechnya that has killed thousands of innocent civilians. Mr. Speaker, I believe that this resolution should be a wake-up call to our President that now is the time to take action, appropriate action, that Russia cease its support for Lukashenka and his dictatorship. This resolution calls on the President to raise the issue of Russian financial support for the Lukashenka regime and to report to the Congress on the steps undertaken to persuade it to end that kind of support. Once again, that simply has to come to an end, and our Nation should make it clear that we not going to support further IMF loans, debt forgiveness or other forms of assistance of importance to the Russian government until it ends this kind of support to Belarus. Mr. Speaker, let me state in closing that there are some important issues that, regrettably, are not raised in this measure, including the mysterious incident in September of 1995 in which a Belarusan helicopter gunship shot down an American hot air balloon involved in an international race, killing two American civilians; Lukashenka's eviction of our American ambassador from his official residence, in violation of international diplomatic conventions; and, finally, reports that the illegitimate government in Belarus may be engaged in the proliferation of advanced military technology to other such regimes around the world. This comprehensive resolution does not go into those issues, but, as I have noted, it makes it clear that now is the time to halt Russian support for the Lukashenka dictatorship, and it does indeed do a great service to the repressed people of Belarus simply by stating the obvious, that the government of Belarus is nothing but a dictatorship. Mr. Speaker, it is time for the Russian government to cease its financial support for the regime in Minsk, to halt its moves to reunify its government and military with Lukashenka's regime and its Armed Forces, to respect the sovereignty of Belarus, and to join us in sincerely working for the cause of true democracy in that suffering country. Mr. Speaker, I fully support the passage of this resolution. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.","word.count":805,"sep11":-1.39325842696629,"years":2000.46629213483,"days":1946,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0439657572908027,"Topic 2":0.0390195230732552,"Topic 3":0.0108722313581545,"Topic 4":0.0183863074998809,"Topic 5":0.0101653723131312,"Topic 6":0.624388540282515,"Topic 7":0.159665018038186,"Topic 8":0.0662929816832813,"Topic 9":0.0248268902813051,"Topic 10":0.00241737817948708},{"id":"10920060057536","body":"Conrad Burns: Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Galt family from my home State of Montana. The Galt family first came to Montana in 1910 settling in Judith Basin County. They have been leaders in their communities ever since. One member of the Galt family paid the ultimate sacrifice for his country at the young age of 24. U.S. Army CPT William Wylie Galt was awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously for his brave actions in 1944. The Medal of Honor is the highest award for valor in action against an enemy force that can be bestowed upon an individual serving in the armed services of the United States. Captain Galt's citation reads: In 2005, the Base Realignment and Closure Commission, BRAC, decided to permanently close Galt Hall U.S. Army Reserve Center on Gore Hill in Great Falls, MT, and relocate units to a new Armed Forces Readiness Center near Malmstrom Air Force Base across town. The U.S. Army Reserve Center on Gore Hill was dedicated to Captain Galt in 1958. I believe it is a fitting tribute to name the U.S. Armed Forces Readiness Center in Great Falls, MT, ``The Captain William Wylie Galt Great Falls Armed Forces Readiness Center'' to carry on the history of this brave Montanan. Captain Galt may be gone, but with the naming of the Armed Forces Readiness Center in Great Falls after him, the memory of this true hero will live on and remind us that freedom is never free.","word.count":249,"sep11":5,"years":2006.8595505618,"days":4222,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.237428378649402,"Topic 2":0.00872216648712097,"Topic 3":0.21991749645596,"Topic 4":0.00869329676971653,"Topic 5":0.312404082196976,"Topic 6":0.0138577260489174,"Topic 7":0.000573439112574656,"Topic 8":0.0712624286350494,"Topic 9":0.000810726388188861,"Topic 10":0.126330259256095},{"id":"10519980012601","body":"Jack Kingston: Mr. Speaker, I will move on Here we have a situation where Dan Burton's big crime, even though he has broken no law, but he is being accused of disclosing doctored tapes.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong support of H.R. 3249. It is very important legislation to remedy retirement enrollment errors. I want to add my very strong thanks to the chairman, the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Mica] and to his staff for the enormous work that they have done on this legislation. I also want to thank the gentleman from Maryland [Mr. Cummings], the ranking member. I want to also thank the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight chair and ranking member, and also the Committee on Ways and Means. So my colleagues can see, this has been a very important bipartisan effort involving a number of committees but emanating from problems that Federal employees had and in the subcommittee markup. At the Subcommittee on Civil Service hearing last year, we heard some horror stories of those who were placed in the wrong retirement system. We cannot make up for the pain caused by these errors, but we can indeed prevent more errors from occurring and provide as fair a remedy as possible, which is what this legislation before us does. We must move forward quickly to remedy the errors of the past and to prevent future suffering, especially as more employees discover they are in the wrong system during the current retirement open season. Many, possibly thousands, of Federal employees who have been hired since the inception of FERS have been erroneously placed in CSRS. Many of them do not even know that they are in the wrong system, and serious financial consequences that await them if no legislation is enacted are going to be tremendous. Those who have discovered their retirement errors have been deprived of critically important retirement and tax benefits and they have been subjected to severe strain and they have incurred tremendous legal expenses. So, Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us truly makes whole those Federal employees who have already been corrected, many harmed really, such as one of my constituents, Barry Schrum. Under this bill, employees may choose to remain in the retirement system in which they were mistakenly placed or to be covered by the system in which they should have been placed. If an employee chooses FERS, this legislation makes them whole by making up lost earnings in their thrift savings plans in those accounts. I am pleased that this legislation will ensure that agencies are not unduly burdened by this legislation in making employees whole again. So again, I want to congratulate all involved, particularly the leadership that came from the chairman and the ranking member of the subcommittee and the staffs that have made it all possible. Very important legislation. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.","word.count":463,"sep11":-3.22752808988764,"years":1998.63202247191,"days":1293,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.130102189263653,"Topic 2":0.221367776109365,"Topic 3":0.0171044907034149,"Topic 4":0.472332004259385,"Topic 5":0.00476774903800565,"Topic 6":0.0102571867831033,"Topic 7":0.0475483706320328,"Topic 8":0.0335654579223668,"Topic 9":0.0508790301525983,"Topic 10":0.012075745136075},{"id":"10619990031102","body":"Ken Calvert: Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 4975, and that H.R. 4975 be re-referred to the Committee on Government Reform.","word.count":351,"sep11":-2.04494382022472,"years":1999.81460674157,"days":1714,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0495533415738053,"Topic 2":0.393301879418139,"Topic 3":0.239761002568581,"Topic 4":0.0139317684108912,"Topic 5":0.0831669539238499,"Topic 6":0.015828496983766,"Topic 7":0.172348380778192,"Topic 8":0.00668567845007695,"Topic 9":0.021861323074599,"Topic 10":0.0035611748181002},{"id":"10820030045465","body":"James Jeffords: Mr. President, on December 9, 2003, I filed Report 108-220 to accompany S. 1879, a bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to revise and extend provisions relating to mammography quality standards.

This report discusses only matters concerning the national emergency with respect to Iran that was declared in Executive Order 12957 and does not deal with those relating to the emergency declared on November 14, 1979, in connection with the hostage crisis. 1. On March 15, 1995, I issued Executive Order 12957 to declare a national emergency with respect to Iran pursuant to IEEPA, and to prohibit the financing, management, or supervision by United States persons of the development of Iranian petroleum resources. This action was in response to actions and policies of the Government of Iran, including support for international terrorism, efforts to undermine the Middle East peace process, and the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them. A copy of the Order was provided to the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate by letter dated March 15, 1995. Following the imposition of these restrictions with regard to the development of Iranian petroleum resources, Iran continued to engage in activities that represent a threat to the peace and security of all nations, including Iran's continuing support for international terrorism, its support for acts that undermine the Middle East peace process, and its intensified efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction. On May 6, 1995, I issued Executive Order 12959 to further respond to the Iranian threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The terms of that order and an earlier order imposing an import ban on Iranian-origin goods and services were consolidated and clarified in Executive Order 13059 of August 19, 1997. At the time of signing Executive Order 12959, I directed the Secretary of the Treasury to authorize through specific licensing certain transactions, including transactions by United States persons related to the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal in The Hague, established pursuant to the Algiers Accords, and related to other international obligations and U.S. Government functions, and transactions related to the export of agricultural commodities pursuant to preexisting contracts consistent with section 5712 of title 7, United States Code. I also directed the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to consider authorizing United States persons through specific licensing to participate in market-based swaps of crude oil from the Caspian Sea area for Iranian crude oil in support of energy projects in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan. Executive Order 12959 revoked sections 1 and 2 of Executive Order 12613 of October 29, 1987, and sections 1 and 2 of Executive Order 12957 of March 15, 1995, to the extent they are inconsistent with it. A copy of Executive Order 12959 was transmitted to the Congressional leadership by letter dated May 6, 1995. 2. On August 19, 1997, I issued Executive Order 13059 in order to clarify the steps taken in Executive Order 12957 and Executive Order 12959, to confirm that the embargo on Iran prohibits all trade and investment activities by United States persons, wherever located, and to consolidate in one order the various prohibitions previously imposed to deal with the national emergency declared on March 15, 1995. A copy of the Order was transmitted to the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate by letter dated August 19, 1997. The Order prohibits the importation into the United States of any goods or services of Iranian origin or owned or controlled by the Government of Iran except information or informational material; the exportation, reexportation, sale, or supply from the United States or by a United States person, wherever located, of goods, technology, or services to Iran or the Government of Iran, including knowing transfers to a third country for direct or indirect supply, transshipment, or reexportation to Iran or the Government of Iran, or specifically for use in the production, commingling with, or incorporation into goods, technology, or services to be supplied, transshipped, or reexported exclusively or predominantly to Iran or the Government of Iran; knowing reexportation from a third country to Iran or the Government of Iran of certain controlled U.S.-origin goods, technology, or services by a person other than a United States person; the purchase, sale, transport, swap, brokerage, approval, financing, facilitation, guarantee, or other transactions or dealings by United States persons, wherever located, related to goods, technology, or services for exportation, reexportation, sale or supply, directly or indirectly, to Iran or the Government of Iran, or to goods or services of Iranian origin or owned or controlled by the Government of Iran; new investment by United States persons in Iran or in property or entities owned or controlled by the Government of Iran; approval, financing facilitation, or guarantee by a United States person of any transaction by a foreign person that a United States person would be prohibited from performing under the terms of the Order; and any transaction that evades, avoids, or attempts to violate a prohibition under the Order. Executive Order 13059 became effective at 12:01 a.m., eastern daylight time on August 20, 1997. Because the Order consolidated and clarified the provisions of prior orders, Executive Order 12613 and paragraphs , , , , and of section 1 of Executive Order 12959 were revoked by Executive Order 13059. The revocation of corresponding provisions in the prior Executive orders did not affect the applicability of those provisions, or of regulations, licenses or other administrative actions taken pursuant to those provisions, with respect to any transaction or violation occurring before the effective date of Executive Order 13059. Specific licenses issued pursuant to prior Executive orders continue in effect, unless revoked or amended by the Secretary of the Treasury. General licenses, regulations, orders, and directives issued pursuant to prior orders continue in effect, except to the extent inconsistent with Executive Order 13059 or otherwise revoked or modified by the Secretary of the Treasury. The declaration of national emergency made by Executive Order 12957, and renewed each year since, remains in effect and is not affected by the Order. 3. On March 4, 1998, I renewed for another year the national emergency with respect to Iran pursuant to IEEPA. This renewal extended the authority for the current comprehensive trade embargo against Iran in effect since May 1995. Under these sanctions, virtually all trade with Iran is prohibited except for trade in information and informational materials and certain other limited exceptions. 4. There have been no amendments to the Iranian Transactions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 560 , since my report of September 17, 1997. 5. During the current 6-month period, the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control made numerous decisions with respect to applications for licenses to engage in transactions under the ITR, and issued seven licenses. The majority of denials were in response to requests to authorize commercial exports to Iran--particularly of machinery and equipment for various industries-- and the importation of Iranian-origin goods. The licenses issued authorized certain financial transactions, transactions relating to air safety policy, and to disposal of U.S.-owned goods located in Iran. Pursuant to sections 3 and 4 of Executive Order 12959 and consistent with the Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act of 1992 and other statutory restrictions concerning certain goods and technology, including those involved in air-safety cases, the Department of the Treasury continues to consult with the Departments of State and Commerce on these matters. The U.S. financial community continues to scrutinize transactions associated with Iran and to consult with OFAC about their appropriate handling. Many of these inquiries have resulted in investigations into the activities of U.S. parties and, where appropriate, the initiation of enforcement action. 6. The U.S. Customs Service has continued to effect numerous seizures of Iranian-origin merchandise, primarily carpets, for violation of the import prohibitions of the ITR. Various enforcement actions carried over from previous reporting periods are continuing and new reports of violations are being aggressively pursued. Since my last report, OFAC has collected six civil monetary penalties totaling nearly $84,000 for violations of IEEPA and the ITR. 7. The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the 6-month period from September 15, 1997, through March 14, 1998, that are directly attributable to the exercise of powers and authorities conferred by the declaration of a national emergency with respect to Iran are reported to be approximately $1.3 million, most of which represent wage and salary costs for Federal personnel. Personnel costs were largely centered in the Department of the Treasury   , the Department of State   , and the Department of Commerce . 8. The situation reviewed above continues to present an extraordinary and unusual threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The declaration of the national emergency with respect to Iran contained in Executive Order 12957 and the comprehensive economic sanctions imposed by Executive Order 12959 underscore the United States Government's opposition to the actions and policies of the Government of Iran, particularly its support of international terrorism and its efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them.

I think the single strongest impression I had was that it brought to them a new impression of the Congress itself, a closer analysis of the Congress than they get in the daily newspaper or in their texts. The bipartisanship which was displayed with the group, both groups with which I spent time, was outstanding. The Members on the other side and I disagreed on issues, we disagreed and were not disagreeable in front of these students, and took on some pretty tough ones. It was a good experience for us, and, I hope, a good experience for the students.","word.count":167,"sep11":1.6123595505618,"years":2003.47191011236,"days":3016,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.308195969255836,"Topic 2":0.141683272785464,"Topic 3":0.0767739473656574,"Topic 4":0.013352435848223,"Topic 5":0.0153502048633627,"Topic 6":0.030692718797562,"Topic 7":0.0176137368467581,"Topic 8":0.342759189464478,"Topic 9":0.0411862493169283,"Topic 10":0.0123922754557308},{"id":"10920050004936","body":"John Spratt: Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

We could consider legislation to reduce the price of the drugs by allowing Medicare to negotiate with the pharmaceutical companies. That was a question my seniors had at the workshop. We should also consider legislation to extend an open enrollment period and give beneficiaries a one-time chance this year to change plans if they decide to instead of discussing ways to improving the clearly flawed plan, which does nothing substantive for our seniors.

Armey: Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce, on behalf of 14 Senators, the Adolescent Family Life and Abstinence Education Act of 1996 and, on behalf of 12 Senators, the Adoption Promotion Act of 1996. I am pleased to be introducing these bills with many colleagues from both parties, which I shall describe shortly. Mr. President, I am introducing two bills designed to bring Americans together on one of the most controversial, if not the most controversial matter facing the United States domestically today, and that is the question of abortion, pro-choice, pro-life. While we cannot achieve agreement on all aspects of that underlying controversy, I believe it is possible to make enormous steps forward on the issue of abstinence; that is, to try to curtail premarital sex, especially among teenagers, which results in unintended pregnancies, and to promote adoption through tax credits, to try to encourage those who are in the situation of unintended pregnancy to carry through to term. At the outset, let me provide my colleagues with a brief summary of the legislation. This legislation would support an authorization for $75 million annually to have abstinence education. While there is great concern about education dealing with matters of sex generally, there appears to be an exception when you talk about abstinence. Within the past several weeks, I have had the opportunity to visit the Carrick High School in Pittsburgh, where I met with students who are involved in an abstinence program and with officials of Mercy Hospital which has been the recipient of a $250,000 federal grant for abstinence education. The results there have been very profound. Later, I visited a program in Lancaster, PA, where young people are taking the abstinence pledge and are being counseled in how to respond to peer pressure with counter peer pressure. As I say, while we cannot agree on all aspects of the issue of abortion, pro-choice, pro-life, I believe when we talk about abstinence, that is an area of agreement. Similarly, on adoption, there have been many efforts to give tax breaks. This legislation is another effort, with up to a $5,000 tax credit for adoption, and up to $7,500 for adopting children with special needs. These two bills will supplement legislation which I have already pushed on prenatal care for pregnancies, again involving many youngsters in their teens. I saw my first one-pound baby more than a decade ago. It is really a startling sight, a child no bigger than my hand, carrying medical problems for a lifetime and costing up to $200,000 in medical care per child for just the first year. I believe this abstinence legislation, in conjunction with adequate prenatal care and the Healthy Start program, will go a long way toward avoiding teenage pregnancies and the complications that can arise, such as low- birth-weight babies. Mr. President, on March 28, 1996, I spoke on the Senate floor in support of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's Teen Pregnancy Prevention Week. During that week, communities throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania conducted special activities to promote pre-marital abstinence as the best, healthiest way to prevent teen pregnancy and the many other physical, emotional, and relational consequences of early sexual activity. On Friday, March 15, 1996, I had the opportunity to kick-off this important week at Central High School in Philadelphia, and during my remarks, I stated that I would be introducing two legislative proposals that deal with the important issue of teen pregnancy, one on abstinence education and one on promoting adoption. By way of background, nearly 200 years ago, the French writer Alexis de Tocqueville is said to have observed that ``America is great because she is good, and if America ever ceases to be good, America will cease to be great.'' Although de Tocqueville is long gone, his analysis is timeless. It is impossible to be a public official today, to travel throughout States such as Pennsylvania and elsewhere in the United States, without recognizing that America's problems are more moral than material. The news media offer us a monthly snapshot of leading economic indicators, but it may be that our leading moral indicators are more telling, such as the staggering number of teenage pregnancies, the national divorce rate, and the rapid rise in juvenile crime. As we have tried to steer towards a growing economy and a balanced budget, there has been a growing consensus that all our goals-- personal, economic, and national security--must rest on a restored ethic of personal responsibility. There has been an increased recognition that a crisis of values underlies the many public policy problems the Senate addresses on a daily basis. This has impressed upon me the need for people of strong moral commitments to enter public service and public debate, so that we may confront the underlying problems. On the critical question of the health of America's families, the grim statistics are well known, but worth repeating. These leading moral indicators suggest that the erosion of the American family continues unabated. For example, more than 50 percent of American marriages now end in divorce, meaning that millions of American children face at least some instability in their home environment. Then, there is the alarming number of teenagers getting pregnant in the United States. According to statistics released by the Centers for Disease Control in 1995, there were an estimated 835,000 teenage pregnancies in 1990. Further, the National Center for Health Statistics reports that in 1993, 12,000 girls under 15 years of age gave birth to a child. To me, this necessitates a strong response from public officials, the clergy, and concerned citizens. A leading moral indicator is the rapid increase in the number of unwed mothers. The percentage of teen births that occurred outside of marriage has risen from 48 percent in 1980 to 72 percent of all teenage births in 1993. According to my distinguished colleague, Senator Moynihan, within 10 years, unless we reverse current trends, more than half our children will be born to unmarried women. By comparison, the United States teenage birth rate--60 births per 1,000 females aged 15 to 19--is double the rate in other industrialized societies such as Australia and the United Kingdom. France and Japan report some of the lowest teenage birth rates, at nine and four births per 1,000 females, respectively. It is worth pausing to reflect on the enormous significance of these statistics regarding out-of-wedlock births. Marriage is obviously important as it relates to the benefits for children to have a strong family structure based on a commitment of mutual support and respect. On the subject of family values, I speak with considerable pride about the institution of marriage with my parents and my siblings. In addition to my parents' marriage of 45 years, my brother, Morton, and his wife, Joyce, were married for 51 years until his death in 1993. My sister, Hilda, and her husband, Arthur Morgenstern, celebrated their 53rd wedding anniversary in April. My sister, Shirley, was married to Edward Kety for 46 years until his death last summer. My son, Shanin, and his wife, Tracey, will celebrate their 10th wedding anniversary on June 29, 1996. So our family totals 248 years of marriage. In considering the troubling statistics on out-of-wedlock births, I believe there is much we can do to reduce the likelihood that an unmarried teenager will become pregnant in the first place. While I am personally opposed to abortion, I do not believe it can be controlled by the Government. I believe it is a matter for the woman and family, with appropriate guidance by ministers, priests, and rabbis. I do believe the government has a significant role in promoting alternatives to abortion. In my view, there is no reason why people on both sides of the abortion debate cannot work together to promote those alternatives. We can reduce teenage pregnancies by encouraging abstinence and personal responsibility. If a teen pregnancy does occur, we should promote adoption as a socially beneficial alternative. We can, and we must, confront our leading moral indicators head-on. We must press harder in the fight to reduce the alarming number of teenage pregnancies. And, when a child comes into the world as the result of an unintended pregnancy, we must do all that we can to ensure that it is raised in a loving, stable family environment. It is the American family, of course, to which these responsibilities chiefly belong. Nonetheless, I believe that the Government can play a role and that we in the Congress must seek out appropriate legislative means to advance this cause. Accordingly, I am today introducing these two bills which will strengthen the social fabric and family stability of our Nation. Before I go into greater detail on these two bills, I want to point out that I have benefited from thoughtful review and comments by a number of individuals with expertise on the issues of teen pregnancy, abstinence, and adoption, including Bill Pierce of the National Council on Adoption; H. Woodruff Turner and Katrina Schulhof of the Pittsburgh Adoptive Family Rights Council; David Keene of the American Conservative Union; Ms. Molly Kelly of Philadelphia; Larry Breitenstein of the Westmoreland County Childrens Bureau; Dr. Carol Jean Vale, President of Chestnut Hill College; Sister Roseanne Bonfini of Immaculata College; James Stark of the Fayette County Community Action Agency; Danelle Stone and Melissa Mizner of Catholic Charities Counseling and Adoption Services--Erie Diocese; Washington County Commissioner Diana Irey; Reverend Horace Strand, Sr. of the Faith Temple Holy Church and Christian School; Rev.

The professors denounced intelligent design as pseudo science and advocated what is bluntly called the materialistic approach to science. Mr. Speaker, I am appalled that any university seeking to discover truth, yet alone a university that is a Baptist Christian school, could make the kinds of statements that are contained in this letter. Is there position on teaching about materialistic science so weak that it cannot withstand scrutiny and debate? Intelligent design theory is upheld by the same kind of data and analysis as any other theory to determine whether an event is caused by natural or intelligent causes; just as a detective relies on evidence to decide whether a death was natural or murder, and an insurance company relies on evidence to decide whether a fire is an accident or arson. A scientist looking at, say, the structure of a DNA molecule goes through exactly the same reasoning to decide whether the DNA code is the result of natural causes or an intelligent agent. Today, qualified scientists are reaching the conclusion that design theory makes better sense of the data. Influential new books are coming out by scientists like molecular biologist Behe, Darwin's Black Box, the Free Press, and mathematician William Dembski, the Design Interference, Cambridge University Press, which point out the problems with Darwinian evolution and highlight evidence for intelligent design in the university. The tone of the letter I received seems to suggest that my congressional colleagues and I were unsuspecting honorary co-hosts in a conference on intelligent design. That is not the case. My good friend, the gentleman from Florida , chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution has considered holding a congressional hearing on the bias and viewpoint discrimination in science and science education. Ideological bias has no place in science and many of us in Congress do not want the government to be party to it. The gentleman from Florida approached several people, including the Discovery Institute, about plans for such a hearing. The people at Discovery suggested that instead we allow them merely to put on a modest informational briefing on intelligent design. That is exactly what happened, and we regarded the result as very valuable. Nevertheless, many of us continue to be concerned about the unreasoning viewpoint discrimination in science. This letter dismisses those who do not share the philosophy of science favored by the authors as frauds. It is ironic, however, that the authors do not ever actually get around to answering the substantive arguments put forward by people at the Discovery Institute. The authors support a philosophy of science they call materialistic science. The key phrase in the letter is that we cannot consider God's role in the natural phenomenon we observe. Yet this assumption is merely asserted without any argument. How can the authors of this letter be so confident that God plays no role in the observable world? Once we acknowledge that God exists, as these professors presumably do since they teach as a Christian university, there is no logical way to rule out the possibility that God may actually do something within the universe He created. In addition, the philosophy of science the authors talk about is just that, a philosophy. It is not itself science, even according to the definition of science put forward by the authors themselves. They state, for example, that all observations must be explained through empirical observations. I am not sure what that means but I do know this: This statement itself is not verifiable by observation or by methods of scientific inquiry. It is rather a philosophical statement. If they prefer it to the alternative that they suppose it advanced by the Discovery Institute folks, then the preference itself cannot be based on science. It is a difference of philosophy, but they are biologists not philosophers. They have no special authority in philosophy, even the philosophy of science. Even more egregiously, they say that God cannot be proved or disproved. Now there is a philosophical statement for you. Of course many philosophers agree with it, but there are philosophers of stature who disagree with it, too. Why should the philosophical viewpoint of a group of biologists enjoy privileged status? And then there was Darwinism. This letter treats Darwinism as a straightforwardly scientific position despite the criticism advanced by many responsible, informed people that Darwinism itself rests not on demonstrable facts but rather on controversial philosophical premises. In other words, serious people make a case against Darwinism, precisely the case that Baylor's biologists themselves are trying to make against intelligent design. Yet the Baylor biologists simply ignore these criticisms. One senses here not a defense of science but rather an effort to protect, by political means, a privileged philosophical viewpoint against a serious challenge. In digging into this matter further, it turns out that an international conference related to this topic, the Nature of Nature, was held recently at Baylor University. It was hosted by the Polanyi Center at Baylor and sponsored by the Discovery Institute and the John Templeton Foundation. A number of world-class scientists participated in the event, and contrary to the assertions made in this letter, advocates of intelligent design, as well as materialism, presented their ideas publicly. The authors of this letter have been part of an intense effort to close down that center, which was founded in part to explore these issues. I would like to insert the rest of this statement in the Record, as well as the letter from the professors at Baylor University. I would like to reference the words of the Israeli statesman, Shimon Peres: He said, ``Science and lies cannot coexist. You don't have a scientific lie, and you cannot lie scienifically. Science is basically the search of truth--known, unknown, discovered, undiscovered--and a system that does not permit the search for truth cannot be a scientific system. Then again, science must operate in freedom. You cannot have free research in a society that doesn't enjoy freedom. . . . So in a strange way, science carries with it a color of transparency, of openness, which is the beginning of democracy . . .'' Dr. Bruce Alberts, President of the National Academy of Sciences made a recent speech where he said ``Scientists, as practitioners, teach important values. These include honesty, an eagerness for new ideas, the sharing of knowledge for public benefit, and a respect for evidence that requires verification by others. These ``behaviors of science'' make science a catalyst for democracy. Science and democracy promote similar freedoms. Science and democracy accommodate, and are strengthened by, dissent. Science's requirement of proof resembles democracy's system of justice. Democracy is buttressed by science's values. And science is nurtured by democracy's principles.'' There seems to be a tension between science as democratic, welcoming new ideas and dissent--and science as a lobby group, seeking to impose its viewpoint upon others. As the Congress, it might be wise for us to question whether the legitimate authority of science over scientific matters is being misused by persons who wish to identify science with a philosophy they prefer. Does the scientific community really welcome new ideas and dissent, or does it merely pay lip service to them while imposing a materialist orthodoxy? Only a small percentage of Americans think the universe and life can be explained adequately in purely materialistic terms. Even fewer think real debate on the issue ought to be publicly suppressed. I ask my colleagues to join with me in putting aside unfounded fears to explore the evidence and truthfulness of the theories that are being presented by those on both sides of this debate. I want to thank Philip Johnson of the University of California at Berkeley. Robert * * * of Princeton University, and others is drafting this response.","word.count":310,"sep11":-2.29494382022472,"years":1999.56460674157,"days":1625,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0863935125247864,"Topic 2":0.0290308070049036,"Topic 3":0.00550210195674878,"Topic 4":0.0318808687886322,"Topic 5":0.0217497921867124,"Topic 6":0.00432522512540371,"Topic 7":0.229635041930062,"Topic 8":0.0540186116710606,"Topic 9":0.0072174020510991,"Topic 10":0.530246636760591},{"id":"10920060003252","body":"Tim Ryan: Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman would yield, just as you were saying, this is what you were saying: only 5 percent of the cargo coming in is inspected.

Their own estimates, this is the U.S. Coast Guard and I know you have a Coast Guard, probably more than one facility, down in Miami, in the intercoastal for sure, but this is what the Coast Guard estimates that they may need, $7 billion in order to secure and meet their obligations through the Transportation Security Act. Here is what Congress has appropriated, $900 million, not even $1 billion. We need to be here. Here is where we are. Now, what have the Democrats tried to do? We have been very aggressive and assertive and proactive in trying to make sure that we meet the obligations to protect and secure our own ports. This is just a laundry list. I am going to run through them real quick here. November 28 of 2001, Dave Obey from Wisconsin tried to put $200 million in grants for port security and studies. Republicans knocked it down 216-211 in a party-line vote. April of 2003, another Obey amendment for $722 million to increase security. Again, 221-200. All the Republicans prevented us from increased port security. Again, Democrats, June 17 of 2003, Obey again, $500 million, shot down, party-line vote. June 24 of 2003, Obey again, Republicans blocked consideration of that amendment by a vote of 222-200. All of the Republicans are voting to prevent the increase in funding just by a few hundred million dollars. It is not like we want to even say we are going to go for the whole $7 billion that we need, but we are trying to slowly increase the funding for this so we can make sure that we are protecting our ports. Again, in September 17 of 2003, Obey, Sabo and Senator Byrd tried to increase funding to enhance ports by $475 million. Republicans defeated that amendment on a party-line vote.

Mr. Speaker, we have a real problem here because it seems that every time that the Democrats want to increase funding even marginally to protect our ports, there is a Republican party-line vote that prevents us from doing that.

Freedom of religion is the first part of the first amendment. The United States was founded for religious freedom. The Pilgrims came here in 1607 for that purpose, as did my father Harry Specter, who literally walked across Europe with barely a ruble in his pocket in 1911 seeking a new life for himself and a family which he hoped to have, and religious freedom, because the Cossacks rode up and down the streets of Batchkurina, a small village in Ukraine, in Russia, where my father's brother, Mordechai Spectorski, had fought with the Cossacks, and they were looking for Mordechai Spectorski, who had fled the city. And, the Cossacks continued to look for members of the Specter family. My father immigrated to the United States, as did my mother Lillie Shanin, leaving a small town on the Russian-Polish border at the age of 5, coming to the United States in 1905. The legislation which has passed the House of Representatives has some sanctions in it. It provides that there be no weapons of torture sold, and provides limitations as to what U.S. taxpayer money can be given for, other than humanitarian purposes. And, it seems to me that if the legislation is to have any effect, there have to be sanctions, there have to be weapons in the bill--teeth--in order to promote compliance. I visited this past January in Saudi Arabia and talked to Saudi officials about concerns which I have and which others have had where Christians cannot display a Christmas tree in a window if it is visible from the outside, where Jewish soldiers are reluctant to wear their dog tags identifying themselves as being Jewish, a situation which is intolerable, where we have some 5,000 young men and women who are in Saudi Arabia to protect the Saudis. The situation in Egypt is very serious where there are Evangelical Christians who are being persecuted, where they land in jail if there is a conversion from Islam to Christianity. I was unable to visit the Sudan because of difficulties there, but visiting in nearby Eritrea, I heard stories about the persecution of Christians in Sudan. It is my hope that this legislation will be considered by the Senate in short order so that a firm stand will be taken to deal with the very serious issue of religious persecution worldwide. Again, I compliment the House and chief sponsor, Frank Wolf, and look forward to enactment of this legislation in the Senate. The bill passed by a vote of 375-41, which is well beyond the number necessary to be veto proof. The administration has been opposed to having sanctions in legislation, sanctions such as some of the ones proposed in the bill which I have offered and is pending in the U.S. Senate. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.","word.count":673,"sep11":-3.41573033707865,"years":1998.44382022472,"days":1226,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0410455983142368,"Topic 2":0.164297535006717,"Topic 3":0.078076027236275,"Topic 4":0.0103798915763918,"Topic 5":0.416560427641715,"Topic 6":0.0265019134551638,"Topic 7":0.179537617964562,"Topic 8":0.0231659763980553,"Topic 9":0.0566303411035154,"Topic 10":0.00380467130336819},{"id":"11020080036455","body":"Steny H.

Sometimes, we do not feel the need to discuss measures that have gone through committee and have passed the House, but since there has been so much misrepresentation about the legislation that passed the House on a bipartisan vote called the Medicare Modernization and Prescription Drug Act, and since the Presidential nominees are engaged in a spirited debate, I thought it would be worthwhile to take some time, one, to focus on what it is that the House actually did, but probably more important than the specifics is to put in context the way in which the prescription drug issue has been discussed. I think the first thing that people have to remember is that as the former majority, the Democrats controlled the House the entire time Medicare was law, up until 1994. Indeed, when President Clinton was elected in 1992, the Democrats controlled the House, they controlled the Senate, and they controlled the Presidency. I find it rather interesting that at a time when they could do anything they wanted to do, they did not talk about putting prescription drugs in Medicare for seniors. All right. Let us say that that issue is one which has matured only recently. However, let me tell my colleagues what I consider to be an even more telling fact. During the time the Democrats controlled the House and the Senate and the Presidency, they did not add any preventive care measures or wellness measures. Now, that I think is very telling, because it was pretty obvious even at that time that if we would do relatively aggressive screening on seniors for colorectal cancer, increase mammography, and especially tests for women with osteoporosis; and one of the real scourges is diabetes, and with education and early detection and treatment, we can make significant life-enhancing behavioral decisions; but none of those were part of a Medicare program that the Democrats offered. In 1995, the Republicans became the majority in the House and in the Senate. We offered a series of reforms adding preventive and wellness and suggesting prescription drugs. Well, as some people may remember, the 1996 election was based upon a series of untruths, frankly, that Republicans were trying to destroy Medicare, that Republicans never liked the program and could not be trusted with it. Well, as it is now historically recorded, in 1997, it was the Republican majority that, for the first time in the history of the Medicare program, put a preventive and wellness package together, and proposed a commission to examine the way in which we could successfully integrate prescription drugs into Medicare. Why? Because no one would build a health care plan, especially one for seniors today, that does not make medicines or prescription drugs a key part of the program. Now, what we have heard from this well from a number of our Democratic colleagues about the Republican prescription drug plan and its modernization of Medicare are frankly untruths. They have attempted to use what they have unfortunately historically done during campaign seasons with prescription drugs, and that is, they have tried to scare seniors into believing that Republicans would never believe, notwithstanding the fact that we have mothers and fathers and aunts and uncles and now, for me, even sisters who are on the verge of turning 65; I hope I do not get an irate phone call on that statement; but I have a real concern about making sure that Medicare is relevant to today's seniors' health care needs and especially tomorrow's. I mention that brief history because, as we talk about Medicare, suggested changes in Medicare, and the proposals that the Democrats have offered, including President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore in his race for the Presidency, and alternatives that Democrats may offer, I think it behooves all of us to stick to the facts; to talk about what the programs are. And there are differences between the Republicans' approach to reforming Medicare and providing for prescription drugs, and Democrats'. But one of the things we ought not to do is take the liberty with the truth. One of the things I think we need to put in focus is the fact that, unfortunately, according to recent news reports, Al Gore was unable to contain himself and made up stories; made up a story about his dog and his mother-in-law, which is already on thin ice, and comparing their use and price of drugs. I am sure it was quite a good story. He is good at telling stories. There is just one problem with it: It was not true; it is not true. He made it up. I think it ironic that as the press and some of my colleagues focus on some verbal stumblings on the part of our Presidential candidate, he does not make things up; and that when one is challenged with the pronunciation of a word, I think it is significantly different than when one is challenged with the efficacy of a statement. Al Gore lied. He was probably so overcome by the occasion that he felt he had to have a better story than the truth. And, actually, that is a perfect setting for the discussion of what the Republican prescription drug proposal and the modernization of Medicare is and the Democrats description of it. The first thing they have said frequently is that our program is not in Medicare; it is not even an entitlement program. That is, it is not part of the traditional Medicare. It is something new, it is a risky scheme, and it is probably not going to be available. During the debate, we were pleased to get a letter from the American Association of Retired People, and I do believe that in this instance it is better to rely on third parties describing what our program is rather than listening to us or to our opponents. Because what the American Association of Retired People said was, ``We are pleased that both the House Republicans and Democrat bills include a voluntary prescription drug benefit in Medicare, a benefit to which every Medicare beneficiary is entitled.'' That is where they get the name entitlement. ``And while there are differences, both bills describe the core prescription drug benefit in statute.'' So there should be no misunderstanding, Governor George W. Bush's basic plan is a Medicare plan. The Republican plan, the bipartisan plan, the plan that passed the House, was a Medicare entitlement program. AARP says so. Do not take our word for it. But what we want to spend a little time on tonight is the phrase that there are differences. Because if we do not have to worry about the fundamentals, that is they are both in Medicare, they are both an entitlement program, they are both voluntary, then maybe it might be worthwhile to stress what the differences really are. If once we have met the threshold that Republicans are not trying to destroy Medicare, that we are trying to improve Medicare, just as it was the Republican majority that added preventive and wellness and it was described as an attempt to destroy Medicare, let us spend a few minutes talking about how the plan that passed the House differs from the one that, for example, Vice President Gore wants to offer. And in that regard I am joined by two of my colleagues tonight, both of them members of the Subcommittee on Health of the Committee on Ways and Means, which has the primary responsibility in the House jurisdictionwise of the part A Medicare program and shares the part B Medicare program with the Committee on Commerce. We have worked long and hard. I was a member of the Medicare bipartisan commission that spent over a year examining the particulars. Both of my colleagues were close followers of that debate, read the material, and as we put together the plan that passed the House, we were focusing not on whether or not it was in Medicare but key things that I think seniors are concerned about, such as: Does it give me some choice? Do I get to choose or do I have to fit the plan I am told that I get? The idea that if someone cannot afford the drugs, how do we help them? Whether an individual is low income, or even if they are not low income, whether the cost of the drugs that they are required to take are so expensive that even that lifetime earning they have put away would soon be lost. Those are some of the key questions. But probably the most fundamental question, given the fact that we are going to put drugs now into Medicare, and we are at the very beginning of not an evolution but a revolution in the kinds of drugs that are going to be available to seniors, do we really want a one-size-fits-some government-regulated drug program; or would we rather have the professionals who do this every day for the other health care programs decide when and how we need to shift this mix to maximize the benefit to seniors? That really is, when we strip away all of the scare terms and the untruths about the program, the real question. The differences that AARP has said are in the two plans. And when we begin to focus on the differences, I think we will find that there are not only quantitative differences in the plans but there are clearly qualitative differences as well. Does the gentleman from Pennsylvania wish to talk about one or more of those differences?","word.count":1619,"sep11":-1.00280898876405,"years":2000.85674157303,"days":2085,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.104152017299675,"Topic 2":0.340987123478239,"Topic 3":0.010439357551524,"Topic 4":0.00530566256846992,"Topic 5":0.100656111616963,"Topic 6":0.321761921369521,"Topic 7":0.0605993624266447,"Topic 8":0.0114451591251876,"Topic 9":0.0406806820716094,"Topic 10":0.00397260249216664},{"id":"10419960015564","body":"Robert L.

Mr. President, Labor Secretary Herman summed up the challenge of today's economy when she declared at the National Skills Summit in April that in this country we have ``a skills shortage, not a labor shortage.'' Right now we have the lowest unemployment rate in this country in the last 30 years. But even as we celebrate this remarkable feat--and it is remarkable--we must remember that there are still some 13 million people in this country who want, but do not have, a full-time job. The Kennedy amendment would make full-time employment a real possibility for homeless veterans, young people, and for youths seeking summer employment. I appreciate that the Labor-HHS subcommittee's allocations were inadequate to fund at sufficient levels all of the programs in this legislation and I think they have done a good job with what they had to work with. But clearly Mr. President this bill retreats from our commitment to fund many critical education, training, and health programs. I am troubled that the bill before us does not adequately fund job training programs for homeless veterans. Veterans issues are especially important to me, and I know it is of great importance to my fellow veterans here in the Senate. The Kennedy amendment would allow 1,400 more veterans to receive employment placement and economic security than does the bill put forth by the Republicans. This appropriations bill severely under-funds many important programs, but none more critical than the youth job programs like Job Corps, Youth Opportunity Grants program, and the Summer Jobs program. Mr. President, Job Corps is the nation's largest residential education and training program for disadvantaged youth. This program takes head on the issues and the people who have been left behind in this period of economic expansion. While many Americans enjoy unprecedented prosperity, the nation's unemployment rate among African-American teenagers is 22%, almost double the national teenage unemployment rate. Twenty-six percent of those who dropped out of high school between October 1998-99 are unemployed. We cannot relegate these people to the margins of our society, especially during this moment of great national wealth. There are 120 Job Corps centers in 46 states, including three in my state of Massachusetts. Since 1964, Job Corps has given 1.7 million young people in this country the academic and vocational training they need to get good, entry-level jobs, join the military, or go to college. Job Corps offers GED or high school equivalency programs and training in various occupations, as well as advanced training and additional support services. Graduates of Job Corps go on to work in every field from automotive mechanics and repair, to business, and to health occupations. This amendment would allow Job Corps to serve more than 70,000 additional students and reduce staff turnover by offering Job Corps employees a more competitive salary. This amendment would also greatly increase funding for the Youth Opportunity Grants. These grants serve some of the poorest inner-city areas and Native American reservations in the country, where unemployment levels are well above the national average. Unfortunately, the Republican legislation would not allow the Department of Labor to expand this program. Last year, the Department of Labor was able to fund only 36 of 150 grants under the Youth Opportunity Grant program, two of which are in Boston and Brockton, Massachusetts. This amendment would allow the Department of Labor to fund 15-20 new grants, allowing us to provide job skills and real work experience to people who live in areas that have only heard rumors about our nation's economic growth, but have not seen it for themselves. I would also like to voice my support for increasing funding by $254 million to restore cuts in the Summer Jobs program. In late March I met with 20 members of the Boston Mayor's Youth Council, who raised money to travel to Washington. We met right outside this chamber on the Senate steps. The 20 young people that I met with spoke extremely eloquently and passionately about their experiences in summer jobs programs, and they asked me to speak on their behalf in Washington in support of the Summer Jobs program. Well, Mr. President, I intend to speak on their behalf. Approximately 85% of youths in the summer jobs program last year were between the ages of 14-17. Teens in that age group typically do not find private- sector work. But these young people were afforded the opportunity to learn job skills and responsibility. We have all heard teachers lament that students often greet lessons with cries of ``When are we ever going to have to use this again?'' Summer jobs make education relevant to teenagers, helping to reduce drop-out rates and fostering an interest in higher education. The Workforce Investment Act consolidates the Summer Jobs program and year-round jobs program into a comprehensive system of services for at- risk, low-income youth. But under the bill before us, 13,000 teens will be eliminated from this program. The Kennedy amendment would add back $254 million, allowing us the opportunity to provide summer jobs to 152,400 low-income students, 85% of whom would not otherwise be able to find summer employment. In March I received a letter signed by 22 mayors in the State of Massachusetts, urging me to fight for Summer Jobs program funding. In this letter, the mayors write ``The state has benefitted because with the young people working, negative behaviors that often result from idleness are prevented.'' Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the record following my statement. I know these programs are important and are working. And I know they should receive greater funding.","word.count":1396,"sep11":-2.3623595505618,"years":1999.49719101124,"days":1601,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.182670360740069,"Topic 2":0.0237709792661784,"Topic 3":0.00454188523674467,"Topic 4":0.00962658946518083,"Topic 5":0.00327414800067726,"Topic 6":0.00435556188455285,"Topic 7":0.754122036876717,"Topic 8":0.00752828150177774,"Topic 9":0.00881611799255434,"Topic 10":0.00129403903554766},{"id":"10920060024696","body":"Peter Hoekstra: You know, it is inspiring to see those folks and also knowing that, you know, whether it is an American or an Iraqi injured on the battlefield, that is the quality of care that they are going to get.

But they are also using that tactic to try to divide the country between Sunnis and Shiia.

I just am very grateful that you decided to take this hour to talk a little bit about the financial crisis, really, that our United States is in, and what we can do or what we must do in the near future to begin to get our financial house in order of our Nation. As you know, I am an economist by training and a former financial advisor and investment banker for 12 years before I came to the House of Representatives; and besides sitting on the Armed Services Committee and the Homeland Security Committee, I also sit on the Joint Economic Committee for the Congress, the economic committee that looks at the macro picture of what is going on in the United States. And, quite frankly, we take a look at our position vis-a-vis the rest of the countries of the world. In other words, how are we going to hold on to our financial status, our quality of life, our way of life as we know it? And I believe, every night when I go to sleep, I believe that this is the biggest issue that is facing us here in Washington, D.C., and as Americans. Earlier, Mr. Cooper showed a chart that said that we are telling the American people, this Congress, this Republican-led Congress is telling the American people that, in this coming year, our shortfall or what we are overspending by for the year will be $319 billion. And it says it right there. But the reality is, take aside our responsibilities that we have told people we are going to do for Medicare and Social Security for the future, the reality is that we spend much more than $319 billion this year. Without that Medicare and Social Security responsibility, we really spend $760 billion more than the money we take in. Now we sat down a while ago with the Comptroller of the United States as a Blue Dog Coalition, and he said to us that 70 percent of the deficit that we have on an annual basis is because we are not collecting the taxes we should be collecting from the American public. In other words, with the three sets of tax cuts that were given by President Bush and the Republican Congress, we have failed to take in the money we need to pay our bills. What we are basically doing is borrowing to pay, and at some point that comes due. It is like putting it on a credit card. At some point, the credit card company will come and tell you, okay, you have got to pay up. And, as you know, it becomes much more difficult than to have paid it as you went along. We, as Blue Dogs, believe that we should do pay as you go, that we should make tough decisions every year and decide how we are going to spend and how we are going to tax and bring in the monies we need, how we are going to cut spending, if we need to cut spending. But we haven't been allowed to do that. Each and every year, as Blue Dogs, when we get together and we make our budget and we think about it, Mr. Cooper, on the Budget Committee, others of us, and the reality is that every year the Republicans decide that it is not the year to get our house in order, our financial house in order. Now, you know, there are some things that people haven't even begun to think that will impact even more our deficit spending over the inability for us to pay our bills on an annual basis and, therefore, put it on the credit card. The Medicare part D, the prescription drug program that the Republicans voted in 2 years ago, okay, it hasn't gone very well. We all know that. We all wonder what they are doing with it, et cetera. They said it would cost $400 billion over 10 years. This is extra that they were going to spend. We now know it is going to cost at least $1.5 trillion if we meet the responsibility of that program. That is not factored into the budget deficit that we see coming in the future. Hurricane Katrina, that is not factored in. We have done really very little. We have already given about $83 billion towards Hurricane Katrina, but the two Louisiana senators from that State have a bill that says they want us to spend almost $300 billion more just for Louisiana to get the place fixed up. That is not counted in the deficits we see for the future. And the Iraq war, $1.5 billion a week of spending. How long is it going to take? We are already approaching almost $400 billion spent on that war by the end of this year. And I sit on that committee, the military committee. I don't think we are going to be out by the end of the year. You do the math. $1.5 billion a week. That is the operating cost of being bogged down in Iraq. Will it be 3 years, 5 years, 10 years, 20 years? Korea, at 50 years?

Founded in 1898, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association is the marketing and trade association for America's one million cattle farmers and ranchers. Small businesses, like cattle farms and ranches, are the heart of the American economy. The U.S. cattle industry is comprised of more than one million individual farms or ranches that provide our nation with a steady supply of safe, nutritious beef. Living on a small ranch in Ignacio, Colorado, I know the vast majority of U.S. cattlemen are family farmers and ranchers who are skilled stewards of their natural resources and trained caretakers of the animals under their care. Eighty percent of cattle businesses have been in the same family for more than 25 years and 10 percent for more than 100 years. Cattle ranchers form the largest part of the U.S. food and fiber industry, which, in turn, is the largest segment of the U.S. economy-- nearly 17.5 percent of the gross national product. Doing business in all 50 states, cattlemen contribute to thousands of rural economies and, directly and indirectly, add $153 billion to the national economy. It is also important to recognize that the beef industry provides 1.6 million American jobs, and the U.S. annually produces nearly 25 percent of the world's beef supply with less than 10 percent of the world's cattle inventory. In Denver, where the industry is commemorating 100 years of the cattlemen's association history, we have a unique opportunity for people all across America to join in celebrating the labor of generations of America's cattlemen and women. Since this historic event is taking place in my home state of Colorado, I would like to take this time also to recognize the Colorado Cattlemen's Association, which is one of the nation's oldest cattlemen's associations, founded in 1867, even before Colorado became a state. I am proud to say that with hard working grass-roots organizations like the National Cattlemen's Association and the Colorado Cattlemen's Association, issues that directly affect the West and across this country can be addressed in Washington with great success. In 1996, I joined Senator Domenici on the Senate floor in support of the grazing reform bill in the 104th Congress. It was a moving sight to see so many cattlemen and women in the Senate gallery and the halls of Congress working with their senators to help ensure passage of this vital legislation. Currently, grazing legislation is pending in the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on which I serve. With endorsements from strong grass-roots organizations like the National Cattlemen's Beef Association and the Colorado Cattlemen's Association, we will continue to fight to get this legislation enacted into law. Once again I commend the National Cattlemen's Beef Association for 100 years of dedicated service to America's ranchers and farmers.","word.count":165,"sep11":-4.79213483146067,"years":1997.06741573034,"days":736,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0555873270154889,"Topic 2":0.119737728777055,"Topic 3":0.0197093072219083,"Topic 4":0.48805282225393,"Topic 5":0.0224162606702383,"Topic 6":0.0235380061286107,"Topic 7":0.032096807744707,"Topic 8":0.129270249857209,"Topic 9":0.0753020397300444,"Topic 10":0.0342894506008078},{"id":"10720020051455","body":"Speaker: Without objection, it is so ordered To the Senate of the United States: With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Ireland on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, signed at Washington on January 18, 2001. I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty. The Treaty is one of a series of modern mutual legal assistance treaties being negotiated by the United States in order to counter criminal activities more effectively. The Treaty should be an effective tool to assist in the prosecution of a wide variety of crimes, including terrorism, drug trafficking, fraud, and other white-collar offenses. The Treaty is self-executing. The Treaty provides for a broad range of cooperation in criminal matters. Mutual assistance available under the Treaty includes: taking the testimony or statements of persons; providing documents, records, and articles of evidence; locating or identifying persons; serving documents; transferring persons in custody for testimony or other purposes; executing requests for searches and seizures; identifying, tracing, freezing, seizing, and forfeiting the proceeds and instrumentalities of crime and assistance in related proceedings; and such other assistance as may be agreed. I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification. The White House, July 11, 2002. To the Senate of the United States: With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Russian Federation on the Conservation and Management of the Alaska-Chukotka Polar Bear Population done at Washington on October 16, 2000 . I also transmit, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to that Agreement. The U.S.-Russia Agreement provides legal protections for this population of polar bears in addition to those found in the Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears done at Oslo, November 13, 1973 , which was a significant, early step in the international conservation of polar bears. The 1973 Agreement is a multilateral treaty to which the United States and Russia are parties. The 1973 Agreement provides authority for the maintenance of a subsistence harvest of polar bears and provides for habitat conservation. The proposed U.S.-Russia Agreement, which would operate as a free- standing treaty separate from the 1973 Agreement, is the culmination of an 8-year effort. The U.S.-Russia Agreement builds on the 1973 Agreement to establish a common legal, scientific, and administrative frame work for the conservation and management of the Alaska-Chukotka polar bear population, which is shared by the United States and the Russian Federation. For example, the U.S.-Russia Agreement provides a definition of ``sustainable harvest'' that will help the United States and Russia to implement polar bear conservation measures while safeguarding the interests of native people. In addition, the U.S.- Russia Agreement establishes the U.S.-Russia Polar Bear Commission, which would function as the bilateral managing authority to make scientific determinations, establish taking limits, and carry out other responsibilities under the terms of the U.S.-Russia Agreement. The proposed U.S.-Russia Agreement would strengthen the conservation of our shared polar bear population through a coordinated sustainable harvest management program. Early ratification of the U.S.-Russia Agreement by the United States will reinforce our leadership role in international conservation of marine mammals and will encourage similar conservation action by other countries. I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to this Agreement and give its advice and consent to ratification. The White House, July 11, 2002. To the Senate of the United States: With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Second Protocol Amending the Treaty on Extradition Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Canada, as amended, signed at Ottawa on January 12, 2001. In addition, I transmit, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Second Protocol. As the report explains, the Second Protocol will not require implementing legislation. The Second Protocol amends the Extradition Treaty Between the United States of America and Canada, signed at Washington on December 3, 1971, as amended by an Exchange of Notes of June 28 and July 9, 1974, and by a Protocol signed at Ottawa on January 11, 1988. The Second Protocol, upon entry into force, will enhance cooperation between the law enforcement communities of both nations. The Second Protocol incorporates into the U.S.-Canada Extradition Treaty a provision on temporary surrender of persons that is a standard provision in more recent U.S. bilateral extradition treaties. It also provides for new authentication requirements for documentary evidence, which should streamline the processing of extradition requests. I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Second Protocol and give its advice and consent to ratification.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my support for H.R. 3519, the World Bank AIDS Marshall Plan Trust Fund Act, and I would like to commend the gentlewoman from California for her leadership on this critical issue. H.R. 3519 was passed by the Committee on Banking and Financial Services on March 15 by a bipartisan majority. This regulation would direct the Secretary of the Treasury to enter into negotiations with the World Bank for the creation of a World Bank AIDS Trust Fund to provide grants to support HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention programs in the countries of sub-Saharan Africa and other less developed countries. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill. However, I must say I am deeply dismayed that the funding authorized by this bill is only half of what had been approved by the Committee on Banking and Financial Services. During the Committee on Banking and Financial Services's consideration of H.R. 3519, I offered an amendment to the bill that increased the amount of funds authorized to be appropriated for payment to the World Bank AIDS Trust Fund from $100 million to $200 million per year. Although my amendment was passed by the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, the leadership, the Republican leadership, reduced the funding back to only $100 million before bringing the bill to the floor today without any discussion with those of us who worked so hard to double that amount. This undemocratic reduction was done without a unanimous-consent request, without a rule from the Committee on Rules, without any opportunity for the Members of the House to debate it. Given the magnitude of HIV/AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa, this reduction of funding is dangerously unwise. In sub-Saharan Africa, there are over 5,000 AIDS-related funerals every day. Since the beginning of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, over 80 percent of all AIDS deaths have occurred in sub-Saharan Africa. By the end of 1999, there were an estimated 23.3 million people in sub-Saharan Africa living with HIV/ AIDS. This is 70 percent of the total number of HIV-infected people worldwide. The National Intelligence Council of the Central Intelligence Agency, the CIA, released a report in January of this year on the threat of HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases to our national security. According to this report, ``Some of the hardest hit countries in sub- Saharan Africa, and possibly later in South and Southeast Asia, will face a demographic upheaval as HIV/AIDS and associated diseases reduce human life expectancy by as much as 30 years and kill as many as a quarter of their populations over a decade or less, producing a huge orphan cohort. Nearly 42 million children in 27 countries will lose one or both parents to AIDS by 2010; 19 of the hardest hit countries will be in sub-Saharan Africa.'' Despite the urgency of this epidemic, Congress has not demonstrated a willingness to commit the resources necessary to stop the spread of this devastating disease. I am thankful for this $100 million. It should be more. I know that the gentleman from Iowa worked very hard on this. To tell my colleagues the truth, because he is so fair all the time, I was a little bit disappointed that this had happened without any discussion, without my knowing and others knowing, who had worked so hard to increase it, that it would come to the floor in this manner. All we have is $100 million. We do not have the $200 million. Certainly we are not going to turn it down. I support it. I hope we can do better in the future.","word.count":623,"sep11":-1.35955056179775,"years":2000.5,"days":1958,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.00937452099394295,"Topic 2":0.0896825150492369,"Topic 3":0.0245250931899275,"Topic 4":0.00457358839224424,"Topic 5":0.00833089966283625,"Topic 6":0.257265640723353,"Topic 7":0.0234115156067286,"Topic 8":0.093066574202636,"Topic 9":0.46609342231717,"Topic 10":0.0236762298619246},{"id":"10920060031254","body":"Sheila Jackson-Lee: Mr. Speaker, because of my attending the funeral of Officer Rodney Joseph Johnson, a Houston Police Department officer who lost his life in the line of duty, I missed the following votes: Adjournment resolution, rollcall vote 487, if I had been present, I would have voted ``no''; the previous question, rollcall vote No. 488, if I had been present, I would have voted ``no''; H.

We have some important decisions to make. I speak on an event taking place currently in the Capitol, the welcoming of the President of Pakistan. Yesterday, we passed a resolution welcoming President Musharraf of Pakistan to the United States. He arrived in Washington last night. He will be here for a couple of days. I rise to call attention to this visit of President Musharraf and praise his courageous leadership in standing by the United States in its war on terrorism. President Musharraf has taken action within his own country to align with the international community to reject terrorism. It has been a very difficult task for him. Pakistan has been in a great deal of turmoil. President Musharraf has worked to bring calm and peace to that region. But when we went forward with our efforts in Afghanistan, which to date have been quite successful, this was a very trying time in Pakistan. President Musharraf stood by his commitment to end terrorism, stood by his commitment to work with the United States. That has been a help in our efforts in that region of the world and for the future of Pakistan and relationships with the United States. In a speech last month, President Musharraf set Pakistan on a new course with his version of a moderate, dynamic, Muslim nation. He reminded the Pakistani people that charity begins at home. It was time to fight the root causes of extremism: poverty, and illiteracy. He has done this at great risk to himself on behalf of a peaceful and prosperous future for Pakistan. He has opened the way to eventual true peace with India. It is an important message for Pakistan, for South Asia, and for the whole world. President Bush also made note of President Musharraf's important leadership in the State of the Union Address. The President said: Pakistan is now cracking down on terror, and I admire the strong leadership of President Musharraf. Pakistan's support remains essential to our fight against terrorism. We are grateful to President Musharraf for his leadership. Without it, Operation Enduring Freedom could not have been accomplished and could not have received its accomplishments or made the accomplishments that it has to date. We owe much to the Pakistani people. However, the fight is not yet over and risks still remain. Violent extremists could still undermine peace and security in the region. As we isolate our enemies, so, too, must we aid and draw closer to our friends. Pakistan's bold stand against terror alongside the United States is not made in a vacuum. There are real economic and social consequences in Pakistan for assisting the United States in our war effort. It would be a failure of U.S. foreign policy not to pursue the means of assisting our ally in its time of need. We must provide assistance to Pakistan in all the areas that will help keep it on track with President Musharraf's vision for a prosperous, strong, independent, modern Islamic state, a democracy of capital markets. As we have all seen, a small yet very focused and vocal Islamic minority within Pakistan has spoken out against the Pakistani Government and the assistance it received from the United States. The small minority has called for and implemented damaging labor strikes and encouraged countless numbers of young Pakistanis to cross the border into Afghanistan to fight alongside the Taliban. This is a strong vocal minority in Pakistan. A further weakened economy and increased unemployment in Pakistan, the clear results of some weakened markets that have taken place because of the war on terrorism, only add to the influence of fundamentalists in Pakistan by strengthening social and economic unrest on which extremists prey. This is why it is crucial that the United States now provide assistance and support to Pakistan. It is time to make sure that our policies of all sorts--economic, social policies, geopolitical policies--reflect what is best for America, not only in terms of our economy but also for our future security. Helping Pakistan through this difficult and necessary transition is in the direct interests of the United States. We must support those willing to take on the fight for freedom if we are to see our values flourish around the world. I am delighted President Musharraf is visiting the United States at this time. I know he will receive a strong, positive welcome from the United States.","word.count":750,"sep11":0.435393258426966,"years":2002.29494382022,"days":2597,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0125031592911801,"Topic 2":0.0409541110543585,"Topic 3":0.031190008929145,"Topic 4":0.0100152207390009,"Topic 5":0.00397197185625218,"Topic 6":0.0481951853665903,"Topic 7":0.190398214612349,"Topic 8":0.0123306651446875,"Topic 9":0.632724888437207,"Topic 10":0.0177165745692289},{"id":"10619990084637","body":"Chuck Hagel: I thank the Chair Mr. President, what is the objective of a comprehensive test ban treaty? What is the objective of what we are about? The objective is to stop nuclear proliferation. The objective is to make the world safer for mankind. Unfortunately, this noble effort now must be rescued from partisan politics. We are trapped in a political swamp as we attempt to compress a very important debate on a very important issue. A few minutes ago, there was an exchange about timing. We only have a few hours to debate. My goodness, is that any way to responsibly deal with what may, in fact, be the most critical and important vote any of us in this Chamber will ever make? It is not. We cannot have a serious debate about nuclear proliferation when artificial timelines prevent that important debate. Unfortunately, the political environment has captured this issue. Aside from all the technical debate that will go on, as has begun this morning, and rightfully so, about this treaty, this treaty is symbolic. It represents 50 years of America's leadership throughout the world in dealing with our allies and, yes, our adversaries, in trying to curb nuclear proliferation. Much has been said this morning by my distinguished colleagues about our allies, Great Britain and France. They moved forward in good faith last year and ratified this treaty. Consequently, they are dismantling their nuclear testing facilities. What do we say to them if we defeat this treaty? What do we say to the rest of the world, and what is that symbol, what is the message we project? We are far better off to take the time necessary to work our way through the critical questions and issues. This debate needs to be taken down many layers, many levels in the questions that are relevant. We have forced hearings this week in three committees. The committee on which I serve, Foreign Relations, had more than 6 hours of hearings yesterday. They were informative and important. There is a great amount of doubt and question and concern about the governance language in this treaty: Who governs the implementation of this treaty, who is in charge, aside from all the technical questions. We could take days on the provisions for site inspections alone, and we should. What are the consequences of us pulling out of this treaty? I hear from a number of my friends: If it is a bad treaty, we sign it and go ahead, and if the President of the United States says in the supreme national security interests of America we will pull out of the treaty-- my goodness, do we think it is that easy to arbitrarily pull out of a treaty we led for over 50 years under the leadership of President Eisenhower, that was further anchored by the actions of President Kennedy with the first ban on nuclear testing in 1963? Do we think the political environment would be such that we could just arbitrarily pull out when we wanted? Do we not understand the consequences of that? What about side agreements? We learned yesterday, for example, in the Foreign Relations Committee hearings that there are side agreements. That does not mean it is bad, but what are those side agreements? How do they affect us? What is the management? What is the governance? Who makes the deal? Do those side agreements have force behind them? What happens in 10 years when there are new governments? My colleagues understand and share with me the same fundamental responsibility to this country, and that is, America's security is paramount; nothing else is more important. That is our premier responsibility as Senators as we debate this issue. The fundamental principle we must follow is not to jeopardize the security of our people and our country. The U.S. nuclear deterrent has prevented a worldwide conflagration for over 40 years. As former Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger said yesterday in the hearings, that effective deterrence depends entirely on the assurance that our nuclear arsenal will work when it needs to work. It is a huge issue, a huge question. The safety and reliability of the nuclear arsenal, therefore, must be maintained above all. We might be able to do that with computers and other means, other than testing. That may well be feasible. But I want to be assured a lot more than I am now that, in fact, can be done without jeopardizing the security of the United States. We heard much about intelligence reports in all three committees that held hearings this week. The administration says those intelligence reports are not yet complete. Why are we rushing to a vote when we do not have all the intelligence, when we do not have all the information? Why is there this arbitrary test timeline that we must have a vote? What about the next administration? There will be a new administration, Democrat or Republican. I read this morning Donald Trump is interested in a Trump administration. There may be a Jesse Ventura administration, I say to Senator Biden. We do not know.","word.count":853,"sep11":-1.97752808988764,"years":1999.88202247191,"days":1738,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.305458741220866,"Topic 2":0.217982224696512,"Topic 3":0.0140325336399825,"Topic 4":0.0188278942705522,"Topic 5":0.0585517127724143,"Topic 6":0.0101044649177137,"Topic 7":0.00940499778146112,"Topic 8":0.0740312494311638,"Topic 9":0.27158857690009,"Topic 10":0.0200176043692454},{"id":"10619990009069","body":"Benjamin Gilman: Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 2323, the Worker Economic Opportunity Act.

I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this amendment. As I have said before, I believe the agreement we reached among a bipartisan group of Members of this body is a step in the right direction because it gets us to where we are today; that is, we are debating this critical issue on the floor of the Senate. Bringing this issue to the floor of the Senate allows Members of this body an opportunity to improve upon what has previously been negotiated. Senator Graham's amendment is an improvement that should be adopted because it deals with the very most important part of this particular bipartisan piece of legislation, that is, border security and interior enforcement. This amendment creates a more effective deterrent against future illegal immigration by ensuring that illegal immigrants who are caught and deported and then return to the United States in violation of our laws again serve minimum jail sentences. There is nobody who is going to be deported and gets caught coming back in who is going to escape going to jail. It is kind of unbelievable to think about that we do not already have this kind of law on the books today. That is why this piece of bipartisan legislation is so critically important to the future of our immigration laws in this country. Under current law, if an illegal alien is caught entering the United States, that person is deported. This system is subject to abuse because an estimated 20 to 30 percent of those illegal immigrants deported simply return to the United States again in an illegal way. If that same person illegally reenters the United States again, they are subject to fines or imprisonment, but currently there is not a mandatory jail term. So our Border Patrol agents and our Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are faced with the problem of removing the same illegal immigrants time and time again. This amendment will ensure that everyone who is deported from the United States and reenters will serve jail time. This is a most vital piece of legislation in getting control of our borders and in ensuring we have efficient and meaningful interior enforcement. This amendment is critical because it will make sure the resources of our Border Patrol and Customs agents are not expended on the same violators again and again. It also sends a strong signal to everyone in the world thinking about illegally coming to the United States that we are serious about our laws and are seriously going to punish those who violate those laws. I have to say, one problem we have, as we debate this bill and we talk with folks back home, is the credibility of this body, as well as the other body, as well as the agencies charged with carrying out the enforcement. Even though we are charged with oversight, the credibility of the U.S. Government in enforcing the current laws on the books is severely lacking. This is a measure that does put some real teeth into the deporting and reimporting by criminals. In this particular measure, it does give our law enforcement officials an opportunity to not only be serious about enforcement of the law but in a way that is truly meaningful and will go a long way toward stopping illegal immigrants from coming across our borders, as well as doing a better job of enforcing our immigration laws from an interior standpoint. So I urge all my colleagues to vote in support of the amendment offered by my good friend and colleague, Senator Graham. I yield the floor.","word.count":620,"sep11":5.84269662921348,"years":2007.70224719101,"days":4522,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0657211215120618,"Topic 2":0.020972560594227,"Topic 3":0.0143734437199684,"Topic 4":0.0124599910681946,"Topic 5":0.0198905717931218,"Topic 6":0.266304625981795,"Topic 7":0.118470982569809,"Topic 8":0.111681988352965,"Topic 9":0.367083018010935,"Topic 10":0.00304169639692164},{"id":"10419960040506","body":"Vic Fazio: Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to Chairman Thomas' explanation of the bill. I think we can all agree that the goals of this bill are laudable. We must encourage the development and use of new technologies like the Internet. Therefore, I intend to support H.R. 3700. I do have some concerns about the bill, and because of the fact that it may not become law in this Congress, I will simply include those in my remarks for the Record at this time. Mr. Speaker, we all agree that the goals of this bill are laudable. We must encourage the development and use of new technologies like the Internet. Therefore, I will support H.R. 3700. The Internet has changed forever the way that Americans communicate. As such, there is no doubt that the Internet will play an important part in future congressional campaigns. On the Internet, we can speak directly to our constituents--without the filter of the news media or the high cost of television. Moreover, our constituents can respond directly to us--without going through pollsters or reporters or other intermediaries. These changes are profound, and they are profoundly good for our democracy. While I support H.R. 3700, and expect that it will pass the House, there is little chance that the Senate will consider this bill or that it will become law. It is far more likely that we will revisit this issue in the early days of the 105th Congress. With that in mind, I believe there are several areas in which this bill can be improved. The bill, for example, does not really limit who may provide free services to candidates. This creates a loophole for the expanded use of soft money. In particular, the bill would permit a political party committee or an interest group to use soft money to set up an interactive computer service to communicate with Members about Federal elections. This stands in stark contrast to the rules governing broadcast and print media, which cannot be owned by political parties or political committees. Similarly, H.R. 3700 has no real limit on the services that can be provided for free. This is particularly risky as Internet technology advances in ways we cannot anticipate. For example, companies soon will offer long distance telephone service over the Internet. This bill presumably would allow them to provide free long distance service to candidates. Even now, the lack of limits could cause problems, for example, a service provider could send employees out to set up and administer home pages for candidates. Now does H.R. 3700 truly guarantee equal access for all candidates. Although the bill requires a service provider to make the same services available to all candidates, it does not require a service provider to inform all candidates that free services are available. In addition, the bill permits service providers to pick and choose which elections they will participate in. That choice can be manipulated to benefit favored candidates. for example, a service provider could choose only to provide free access for Republican primaries--or races involving candidates that the company wants to influence. Finally, H.R. 3700 lacks any meaningful enforcement mechanism to deal with violations. Presumably, a candidate who is denied access would be required to file a complaint with the FEC, and then to wait months or even years for remedial action. Under this scenario, remedial action likely cannot be taken until an election is over and the dispute is moot. This same problem permeates the election law. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 3700 because it will increase communication between candidates and voters--and that communication lies at the heart of our democratic process. However, H.R. 3700 has serious potential problems, and I hope that we can correct those problems before the bill becomes law. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.","word.count":649,"sep11":-5.08707865168539,"years":1996.77247191011,"days":631,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.103433481382664,"Topic 2":0.365638418534321,"Topic 3":0.0112299611761908,"Topic 4":0.0249626143713484,"Topic 5":0.0199203631667221,"Topic 6":0.00404292009693514,"Topic 7":0.00431189015527681,"Topic 8":0.0377614344959593,"Topic 9":0.00884385391827634,"Topic 10":0.419855062702306},{"id":"10519970048969","body":"John Warner: Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.","word.count":318,"sep11":-4.62359550561798,"years":1997.23595505618,"days":796,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.023397252645853,"Topic 2":0.0708792459350561,"Topic 3":0.00243445430807239,"Topic 4":0.0513885044948033,"Topic 5":0.00195228856793721,"Topic 6":0.00194895189628868,"Topic 7":0.636800192565547,"Topic 8":0.00495706008212934,"Topic 9":0.203003807712463,"Topic 10":0.00323824179185012},{"id":"11020080020258","body":"Mike McIntyre: Mr. Speaker, I thank Randy Forbes for his great work in helping us put this event together tonight. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 888 which affirms the rich spiritual and religious history of our Nation's founding and subsequent history and designates the first week of May each year as American Religious History Week for the appreciation of and education on America's history of religious faith. As we join together on the floor of the U.S. House and stand beneath these words ``In God We Trust,'' while recognizing the importance of a religious history week, let us remember the words of our Founding Fathers. ``We, the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.'' So begins our Constitution with those words of the Preamble. But let us turn back the hands of time for a moment. The day is September 17, 1787. The time is 4 p.m. Thirty-nine men from across the United States look at another one with solemn but joyous faces. The arguments are over; the prayers have been answered; and the miracle has occurred: the Constitution of the United States has just been signed. From May 25 until now, for four long hot months, these men have toiled, not knowing whether their work was one of wisdom or folly. They have their hopes and their doubts. And they wondered whether it would succeed or fail to sustain this infant country. The oldest delegate, Ben Franklin, rises from his chair. At age 81, he has seen this young Nation flounder already under 4 years of indecisive government that divided rather than united. He looks around the room at the men, many of whom were in their 20s and 30s. And he stares once more at the chair occupied by George Washington at the head of the assembly. He had speculated what the half-sun painted on the chair signified. And he said then, ``I have often in the course of this session looked at that behind the President without being able to tell whether it was rising or setting. But now at length I have the happiness to know that it is a rising and not a setting sun.'' Indeed, the miracle of Philadelphia had occurred. The United States was a rising and not a setting one, a Nation whose rays of influence, as we know, would one day be felt the world over. But when we think about why this miracle occurred, when we look back 221 years later, do we know what happened in that hall before those 39 men came out and announced that they had, instead of rewriting the Articles of Confederation had written a new constitution for our country. They had deliberated, they had argued and debated. They had made sure that everyone's opinion was heard. Secondly, they showed their dedication in addition to their deliberation. That meant that they had put in sweat and long hours trying to find out what would benefit us all. But in addition to that deliberation and dedication, they also showed their devotion. They knew that their reliance must not be just upon themselves, but first and foremost, upon God. And as Franklin himself, who was not known as one of the most religious founding fathers, but himself acknowledged God's providence upon that group that met to write our Constitution, said, himself, as he looked at Washington, before they went out and announced in what is today known as Independence Hall in Philadelphia, he said, ``I have lived, sir, a long time, and the longer I live, the more convincing proof I see of this truth, that God governs in the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without His notice, is it likely that an empire shall rise without his aid?'' ``We have been assured,'' said Franklin, ``in the sacred writings that except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it. I firmly believe this,'' said Franklin, ``and I also believe that without His concurring aid, we shall succeed in this political building no better than the builders of Babel.'' What a challenge to us today. What a challenge that that old man, at that time, Franklin, made to all of those young men who were ready to go out and announce what they'd done politically for a new country. But he himself said ``we can only secure these blessings of liberty for ourselves and posterity when we take time too first pray and rely upon the hand of Almighty God.'' And that those 39 men did. Before they walked out of what is today known as Independence Hall to announce that we had a constitution for this new country, they spent time in prayer. You know, that story has been sanitized out of our history books today, but those are Franklin's quotes. And I think it's a challenge to all of us to know that even this man knew scripture and knew that the hand of Almighty God had to be upon our country for us to succeed. We, the people is how the Constitution begins. Will we let the miracle endure? Will we remember what John Adams, our second president, said when our constitution was made? ``Only for a moral and religious people, it is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.'' Mr. Speaker, I challenge us tonight, as we share this time together, I thank Mr. Forbes for giving me this opportunity to share this occasion with him and all of my colleagues who will soon follow, that we support H. Res. 888 as American Religious History Week so that we, as a country, will never forget the very words and actions of our founding fathers, who we are as a Nation, how deep our religious roots run, and remind us of the historical significance that is well documented, of faith and prayer, that we celebrate America's religious heritage, that we remember that we have opportunities in this great land that God has blessed us with, and may we always honor those opportunities in our reliance upon divine providence.","word.count":1060,"sep11":6.94101123595506,"years":2008.80056179775,"days":4913,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.938979242105329,"Topic 2":0.0200856582057968,"Topic 3":0.00414766879673027,"Topic 4":0.0112635205032712,"Topic 5":0.00415538436499081,"Topic 6":0.00465273765763155,"Topic 7":0.00344799088298922,"Topic 8":0.00745324212610245,"Topic 9":0.004092649032933,"Topic 10":0.00172190632422588},{"id":"10620000015914","body":"Dan Burton: Larry Bird was a great player, but he is also a great coach.

Mr. Chairman, at the beginning of last year the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Smith], the chairman of the subcommittee, and I, in my capacity as ranking Democrat on the subcommittee, set about to write a commonsense immigration bill designated to address very real, very objectively provable problems with our immigration policy in the United States today. We set about to write a bill that did not involve Proposition 187 hysteria from the right and did not involve unnecessarily generous efforts to bring in lots of other people, perhaps coming from the left. We set about to write a bill that dealt with real problems. We set about to deal with problems such as this. Legal immigration, and I am not talking about illegal immigration, I am talking about legal immigration under current law, resulted, between 1981 and 1985, in 2.8 million people entering the country legally. Ten years later, between 1991 and 1995, 5.3 million people entered the country legally, twice as many, and these figures do not include the 3.8 million backlog of relatives of these people who are now waiting to enter the country when their time comes. Illegal immigration in 1994 also added to the totals. In that year 1,094,000 illegal immigrants were apprehended and deported. How many succeeded in entering the country and stayed is not known, although most estimates agree it is about 300,000 people. The fact of the matter is, though, we have an enormous number of people coming into this county at a very rapid rate. The basic question that we cannot ignore, and I appeal to those Republicans who are paying attention to certain businesses that are anxious to have more folks in here so they can get cheap laborers, and many Democrats who are concerned about the civil libertarian impact of this, who are concerned about being fair to people as we have always done on our side; I say we cannot responsibly avoid the bottom line conclusion that we have a huge number of people entering the country legally, and a smaller number but a large number entering the country illegally, and it is increasing our population very rapidly. Perhaps the best speech in this debate has already been made on the rule, when the gentleman from California [Mr. Beilenson], a member of the Committee on Rules, observed that our current population of 263 million people is going to reach 275 million people in 4 years, more than double the size of the country at the end of the World War II. The long-term picture of this population situation is even more alarming. Our Census Bureau conservatively projects, and I am reading from his speech, ``that our population will rise to 400 million by the year 2050, more than a 50 percent increase from today's level, and the equivalent of adding 40 cities of the size of Los Angeles,'' and so on. In fact, those are conservative estimates. Many demographers indicate we will be at 500 billion people by the year 2050. I would just suggest that not one Member of this body can responsibly stand on this floor and talk about how to have to balance the budget to protect future generations or how we have to maintain national security to protect future generations, and not at the same time recognize that we must manage the population growth of this country in a responsible way if we are going to protect future generations. That is simply too many people. It is a question of quantity, of low many come in here. Neither the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Smith], nor I harbor the slightest hard feelings toward those that have the courage and the gumption to leave home and come into this country. They are the kind of people with the get-up-and-go that we want. There is no question about that. The bottom line question, though, is how many people can we have come in here and still manage the country in a way that our economy will continue to promise in the future that people who are willing to work hard can get their foot on the bottom rung of the economic ladder and climb up into the middle class. We cannot do that with an unlimited number of people coming into the country year after year after year. Mr. Chairman, are there things about this bill that I would like to change? Yes, there are. We have had disagreements. There are a number of things that I could criticize. I do not like the fact that we did not, in my opinion, address the H 1 problem mentioned by the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Conyers], in as effective a way as we might have. It is improved somewhat in the bill, but the fact of the matter is we could have done it much better. We could have said we are not going to let any American jobs be given up in order to hire folks who are imported for the purpose of taking their jobs. That is what my amendment would have done. I offered it in the Committee on Rules and they refused to let us bring it to the floor. We will deal with that probably on the motion to recommit. I do not like the diversity program. I opposed it in 1991 when it was put in and managed to get it cut in half in the current bill. I still say it is, in effect, a racist program. It is a designed to try to bring more white folks into the country because somebody does not like the number of Asians and Hispanics entering the country. I think it is wrong to have a program like that in the law at all, even if the bill cuts it in half. I have to say that, like we always do when many bills come up, we are going to have to go along with some things that we do not like in order to get a lot of things that I think we need. I do not agree with the investor portion of the bill either. But we have to agree on a bill that will reduce the quantity of people coming into the country. That is what we are all about here tonight. Mr. Chairman, I strongly urge Republicans and Democrats alike not to vote to sever the legal immigration changes in this bill from the illegal immigration changes in this bill. If we do that we are voting to kill our attempts to reform legal immigration. It is just that simple. Not a single person who is voting to sever this bill is coming forward saying, ``if you sever it, we will bring it back to the floor. We will deal with it later.'' Not one of them wants to deal with the question of legal immigration. On the contrary, they want to kill it and eliminate it from the bill. Think of what that would mean. After eliminating that from the bill, many people then will be left to march around the floor beating their breasts talking about how tough they are going to get on illegal immigration. But illegal immigration amounts to, we think, maybe 300,000 a year; legal immigration amounts to 1 million a year. That is where the big numbers are. We either deal with legal immigration or we admit that we are not going to be serious and not going to have enough courage to deal with the really central problem facing this country in terms of the number of people that are entering. Please do not vote to sever illegal and legal immigration. Mr. Chairman, this bill was written to avoid the extremes. So far we have done that. If amendments that are offered, such as this foreign agriculture worker amendment, which neither the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Smith] nor I support, were to succeed, I could not continue to support this bill. The fact of the matter is that it is an anachronism. It was a bad part of our law many years ago. We in 1986 tried to address that problem. We ended up with amnesty and a variety of other remedies to solve the problem. Here we are, right back with it again. Please vote against these extreme amendments. Let us try to keep this thing in the middle of the road. I could speak a long time about all the things this bill does. There is not time in the general debate to do it. I will simply say this: I wish I could avoid having to deal with this subject. It is so sensitive, it is so subject to mischaracterization, it is so subject to misinformation of people, particularly folks that have strong views about the needs of their own ethnic communities, and so easy to imply that those of us who are trying to do something about the quantity of immigration generally somehow have hard feelings toward them. That is not true. I think my record is strong enough over the years to make clear it is not true. It is not true of the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Smith] either. I wish I could avoid the subject. But I will say this: If I did avoid it and I left this House, as I am going to do at the end of this year, I would look back on this year and know that I hid from a problem that was my responsibility to solve at a time when I had a chance to solve it. I strongly urge my Democratic colleagues and my Republican colleagues as well to help us pass a constructive bill that deals with the question of the vast number of people that are coming into the country, the rapid increase in our population, and preserve a situation in which folks that are trying to get their foot on the bottom rung of the ladder can climb that ladder into the middle class without having to scramble and scrape and fight for jobs with folks that are just entering the country. That is really what we are all about here.","word.count":1706,"sep11":-5.62359550561798,"years":1996.23595505618,"days":440,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0682742000895002,"Topic 2":0.00675630102986992,"Topic 3":0.00638377944961318,"Topic 4":0.00383001689063442,"Topic 5":0.00324675710382669,"Topic 6":0.837203805557429,"Topic 7":0.00536879174006112,"Topic 8":0.0626133210222695,"Topic 9":0.00501037118659977,"Topic 10":0.00131265593019577},{"id":"10920050078963","body":"Richard Lugar: Mr. President, today is ``action day'' to support jailed journalists around the world, as declared by the independent organization, Reporters Without Borders.

Last year, at my urging, Congress created a free press institute at the National Endowment for Democracy to promote, as part of our democracy-building efforts, free, independent and sustainable news media organizations overseas. This year, I introduced the Free Flow of Information Act to allow journalists in this country to protect the identity of their confidential sources. After I introduced the legislation, a reporter for one of America's most respected media organizations, Judith Miller of the New York Times, was jailed for 85 days for failing to disclose a confidential source, while another, Matt Cooper of Time magazine, was also threatened with jail for the same reason. I believe that in order for the United States to foster the spread of freedom and democracy globally, we must support an open and free press at home. According to Reporters Without Borders, 112 journalists are currently jailed in 23 countries, including places like China, Cuba, Eritrea, and Burma. This is not good company for the United States to keep.

Despite the decision of minority Members to play politics with this bill, I believe we all are united against our enemies.

This bill increases the funding for the global war on terrorism. It increases by 22 percent our human intelligence. It supports our effort on counternarcotics to eliminate the 17,000 Americans that die every year from drug-related causes and the $160 billion annually in health care, social, and criminal costs.

Over the last years, the American people have been demanding that their schools, places of worship, and other public places be better protected from gun violence. Congress had an opportunity to address the gun violence problem in our country by passing sensible gun laws that would help ensure that young people or those with criminal backgrounds do not illegally gain access to firearms. In the end, Congress failed the American people. It is very disappointing that Congress refused to act on the issue of gun violence. Too many senseless shootings have put our sense of safety in jeopardy. Here are just some of the high profile shootings that took place during this session of Congress, and the casualties that occurred as a result. In the year 1999: January 14, an office building, Salt Lake City, Utah, one dead, one injured; March 18, a law office, Johnson City, Tennessee, two dead; April 15, a library, Salt Lake City, Utah, three dead, four injured; April 20, a high school, Littleton, Colorado, 15 dead, 23 injured; May 20, a high school, Conyers, Georgia, six injured; June 3, a grocery store, Las Vegas, Nevada, four dead; June 11, a psychiatrist's office, Southfield, Michigan, three dead, four injured; July 4, multiple locations, Illinois and Indiana, three dead, nine injured; July 29, two day trading firms, Atlanta, Georgia, 13 dead, 13 injured; August 5, two office buildings, Pelham, Alabama, three dead; August 10, a Jewish Community Center, Los Angeles, California, five injured, and later in the same day, one dead; September 14, a hospital, Anaheim, California, three dead; September 15, a church, Fort Worth, Texas, eight dead, seven injured; November 2 an office building, Honolulu, Hawaii, seven dead; November 3, a shipyard, Seattle, Washington, two dead, two injured; December 6, a middle school, Fort Gibson, Oklahoma, four injured; and December 30, a hotel, Tampa, Florida, five killed, three injured.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 6061, the Secure Fence Act of 2006. Mr. Speaker, as Members of Congress return to their districts, as Members of Congress speak with the American people, it is obvious there is no more defining issue in our Nation today than stopping illegal immigration. This is an issue which is absolutely essential if we are to gain the confidence of the American people, if we are going to show to the American people that we can perform the most basic obligation of any government, and that is to secure the Nation's borders. Now, we passed very comprehensive legislation in December of last year, H.R. 4437, and I was a strong advocate and cosponsor of that, along with Chairman Sensenbrenner, but the reality is that legislation is right now bogged down. What we have to do is we have to prove to the American people and also we have to make substantial progress in combating illegal immigration. One issue in which there appears to be a consensus between the United States Senate and the Congress is on the issue of building a secure fence. So rather than wait, and wait for God knows how long until comprehensive legislation is enacted, there is no reason whatsoever why we should not move forward on targeted legislation which is effective and meaningful. We have to bridge this disconnect between the American people and its government, between the American people and the elite, and we have to show we are responsive. Now, the legislation today incorporates very much what was already passed by the House with significant Democratic votes back in December. It provides over 700 miles of two-layered reinforced fencing. It also mandates that the Department of Homeland Security achieve and maintain operational control over the entire border through a virtual fence, deploying cameras, ground sensors, unmanned aerial vehicles, integrated surveillance technology, and it also requires the Department of Homeland Security to provide the necessary authority to border personnel to disable fleeing vehicles, similar to the authority which is already held by the United States Coast Guard for maritime vessels. We also realize there is concern at the northern border, and I want to especially thank my colleague from New York for his efforts in homeland security, particularly on the northern border. With his help, we were able to enhance the Secure Fence Act to ensure that appropriate technology and infrastructure are being considered and that border security efforts are implemented in a manner that does not stop or deny commerce. Mr. Speaker, this is an issue where the American people are crying out for help. They are crying out for us to take meaningful action. There is, to me, no reason why, and I am trying to anticipate arguments coming against it, basically saying we need comprehensive legislation, and that is a debate we can have. We passed comprehensive legislation in December. But the fact is just because we cannot do everything today doesn't mean that we should do nothing. So I am saying let us do something very, very positive. Let us pass this legislation, which will build a secure fence, which will build a virtual fence, and would also give the border personnel the assistance and the power that they need. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.","word.count":569,"sep11":5.1376404494382,"years":2006.99719101124,"days":4271,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0472465179166373,"Topic 2":0.0609100162671229,"Topic 3":0.00487523204553486,"Topic 4":0.00348970012874752,"Topic 5":0.112018572921171,"Topic 6":0.00242575571982077,"Topic 7":0.136223338995851,"Topic 8":0.495035574927541,"Topic 9":0.0927901660136749,"Topic 10":0.0449851250638984},{"id":"10419960030535","body":"Charles W. Stenholm: Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Chairman, it has been stated numerous times already tonight that the House now has a historic opportunity to move toward enactment of meaningful welfare reform legislation, discouraging the cycle of dependency and moving welfare recipients into work. I could not agree more. But I believe the legislation I am supporting is the best way for the House to realize that opportunity. There is a bipartisan welfare reform alternative that can be supported by a strong majority of members on both sides of the aisle and can be signed into law. That's how historic opportunities are realized. My objections to the Majority bill come down to two simple concerns: I believe their proposal is weak on work and tough on kids. In my book, that's a bad equation that is fixed by the Castle-Tanner substitute. This substitute achieves $53 billion in savings in welfare programs as required by the Majority-approved budget, while protecting children and providing States with the resources that CBO says they need to put welfare recipients to work. Let me repeat. CBO says they need. How many times have we in this body heard unfunded Federal mandates. I would ask my friends on the other side of the aisle to take a good hard look at their language because CBO says it falls short regarding the very States we are attempting to work with. In fact, the Castle-Tanner substitute is the only proposal that has real work requirements that the Congressional Budget Office says States will be able to implement to move welfare recipients to work. Madam Chairman, over the last two years, I have solicited the views of welfare providers, recipients, and local citizens in my district on what Congress should do to allow local communities to implement effective welfare reform. The citizens in my district expressed a very strong desire for local flexibility and adequate funding to design a workable welfare delivery system that would more efficiently and effectively move welfare recipients from welfare to work. I am proud of the work performed by my constituents. They invested their time and energy, they engaged in dialogue with individuals of a different perspective, they developed common goals, and they promoted concrete suggestions for improvements. They did the work I asked of them and now it's my turn to do my part here in Washington. That is precisely how I ended up one of the strongest supporters of the Castle- Tanner substitute. It is the only welfare reform alternative that provides local communities with the support they need to move welfare recipients to work. The welfare reform bill proposed by the majority falls well short of giving state and local governments that flexibility or the resources they need to implement welfare reform proposals. The National Governors Association adopted a resolution yesterday expressing ``concerns about restrictions on states flexibility and unfunded costs'' in the work requirements of H.R. 3734.'' That is the Governors' Association. The Republican bill rejects the NGA recommendations for state flexibility in developing work programs appropriate for local communities and does not provide any additional funds for states to meet the increased work requirements. CBO has estimated that the Republican bill would fall $12.9 billion short of the funding for work programs necessary to meet the work requirements in the bill, and $800 million short of the costs of providing child care assistance to individuals required to work. The CBO report accompanying the Republican bill states: That is CBO. The same CBO we talk about day in and days out that we need to pay attention to. The Castle-Tanner substitute ensures that states would be able to meet the work requirements in the bill by providing $3 billion in additional mandatory funds that states can access in order to meet the costs of moving welfare recipients to work. In addition, Castle-Tanner adopts the recommendations of the National Governors Association regarding state flexibility in meeting work requirements. Rhetoric about tough work requirements is either an empty promise or the greatest unfunded mandate Congress ever imposed if it is not backed up with funding for states and local governments to meet the work requirements. Welfare reform will fail to meet the goal of ending the cycle of dependency and moving welfare recipients to work if states do not have sufficient resources to operate work programs. As the CBO report makes abundantly clear, the work requirements in H.R. 3734 are illusory because states will not be able to implement them. If you support breaking the cycle of dependency and actually moving welfare recipients into work instead of just talking about it, vote for the Castle-Tanner substitute. The Castle-Tanner substitute proves that it is possible to dramatically reform the welfare system in this country without harming children, while still achieving substantial budgetary savings. As we said, we do have an historic opportunity to reform our failed welfare system. We cannot afford to waste this opportunity. The House can take a tremendous step toward ending the political gridlock and finding a bipartisan solution to the problems of our welfare system by passing the Castle-Tanner bill tomorrow. I urge my colleagues to vote for the bipartisan Castle-Tanner substitute.

But there are some American families for whom September 11 is not a memory; it is a crisis in their lives that they wake up with every morning. I am speaking about the families of those who perished--the 5,000 husbands and wives and thousands of children for whom September 11 will be a day they will live with for the rest of their lives. Nearly 600 of the dead were from my State of New Jersey. Senator Corzine and I have begun meeting with the husbands and wives of those deceased. It is an experience I wish every Senator could share. It becomes so common to speculate on whether September 11 has changed America forever. I don't know. But I know that when I meet with these widows and widowers, America has forever changed for them. We debate the economic consequences for our country. I want you to consider the economic consequences for them, what the morning was like, not of September 11 but of September 12, when a husband or a wife was gone. It could have been a young family in a new home, with a new baby. Families wanted to mourn, but there wasn't a lot of time because in 2 weeks a mortgage payment was due, in 3 months a tuition payment was due, that weekend there were groceries to buy, and there were no more paychecks. For them, it is a crisis that never goes away. In the legislation before the Senate, there may be things Senators like and there may be things they do not like. There may be points of controversy. I trust there is one thing upon which we can all agree. I am very grateful that, on a unanimous and bipartisan basis, Members of the Senate accepted, under Senator Baucus's leadership, an amendment I offered that will change the tax status of families who lost a family member on September 11 at the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, or through the anthrax attacks in recent weeks. The amendment I offered is based on an aspect of current American law. If, under the statutes of our country, a member of the military is lost in an engagement abroad, or a civilian employee is killed by a terrorist act abroad, they will incur no tax liability to the U.S. Government for that year. When that provision was written, I have no doubt it did not occur to Members of the Congress that victims would not be people in the service abroad but would be civilians at home; that the front lines would not be in Latin America, Africa, or Asia but in New York, New Jersey, or Virginia. But that is the world in which we live. The laws must be changed accordingly. The Finance Committee, therefore, has put before the Senate a provision that changes the tax laws to relieve the liability of these tragic families. First, income tax liability for this year and last year is waived. No further payments will be paid and refunds will be received when appropriate. Second, we recognize that many of those who worked at the World Trade Center or even in the Pentagon were not salaried employees of considerable means but may have been performing janitorial services or were service employees or worked in the restaurant at the World Trade Center. With modest means, their families face great obligations to plan their futures. They may not have paid Federal income tax. Therefore, the second provision waives FICA taxes or payroll taxes that were paid and may be owing for these families. Third, many of the families of the deceased are now in the process of examining the wills of the dead that say what is available for children, wives, or husbands. Under the Finance Committee legislation, there is estate tax relief for the first $3 million in assets from Federal and State estate taxes. There is $8.5 million of Federal estate tax relief. It is generous, but it is appropriate. Whatever money is to be left for many of these families is all the income they will know for the rest of their lives. It is theirs. That is what the deceased husbands or wives would have wanted. It is for their children and for their futures, not the Government. Fourth, the bill provides help for those who were fortunate enough to survive the attacks, but for those thousands who had injuries current law excludes disability benefits from income if a U.S. employee is injured in a terrorist attack outside the United States. This legislation will extend the same benefit to those citizens of the United States injured in a terrorist attack and receiving disability benefits. Fifth, there is no better statement about America than the hundreds of millions of dollars donated to private charities since September 11, but there is the question of the tax liability of families who receive some of this assistance from employers, friends, family, or charities. Under the provision of the bill, we have made it far easier for charitable organizations to make payments to victims and their families and for companies to establish private foundations to help the survivors with short- and long-term needs. Indeed, any payment from an employer to a victim or family for personal, living, family, or funeral expenses will be tax exempt. It clarifies that payments made by airlines, as well as Federal, State, and local governments as a result of the attacks are also not to be taxed. The Senate may debate much of this legislation. As one Senator who represents hundreds of these victims and their families, much may be negotiable. Some things may be excluded, but one thing must stand. When this year is concluded, no American who found a member of their family on the front line of the war against terrorism should be held liable for taxation of the U.S. Government for charitable, governmental, family, or other assistance. What last dollars these family members may have earned for their wives or husbands or children surely by justice must be their own. On this provision, we should all insist. Madam President, I yield the floor.","word.count":1059,"sep11":0.179775280898876,"years":2002.0393258427,"days":2506,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.106659215184411,"Topic 2":0.364706551690039,"Topic 3":0.0100876882177929,"Topic 4":0.456161413487856,"Topic 5":0.022563275070126,"Topic 6":0.00270654473358793,"Topic 7":0.00438214390376359,"Topic 8":0.00780826104691072,"Topic 9":0.0150664486653273,"Topic 10":0.00985845800018613},{"id":"10920060021497","body":"Richard Pombo: Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of our time Well, it unfortunately hasn't been that enlightening of a debate because we have had a number of people come to the floor and debate things that either weren't in the bill or had nothing to do with the bill. Fortunately, they decided to close with Mr. Markey, who debated something that had nothing to do with our bill, which happens. The truth of the matter is, when it comes to the cost of the bill, it is a net revenue increase to the Federal Government, $2.3 billion over 5 years, $900 million over 10 years. That is what the bill does. So all the numbers you heard about, 600 billion, 800 billion, how many trillion, they pulled them out of the air. The CBO score on the bill is $2.3 billion over 5 years in increased revenue to the Federal Government. We also heard that 80 percent of the OCS is already leased. Eighty percent. That is strange because 85 percent of it is off limits. Eighty percent of it is off limits. And yet they claim 80 percent of it is already leased. Talk about fuzzy numbers? That is about as fuzzy as it gets. We also heard somebody come down here a little while ago, and I love this, oh, we are going to cure it with CAFE standards. We are going to raise CAFE standards. That is how we are going to cure our energy problems. Let me let you in on a dirty little secret on CAFE standards. U.S. auto makers manufacture cars today that get 35, 40, 50 miles to the gallon. What they want to mandate is not that car companies make cars that get 50 miles to the gallon. They want to mandate that you have to buy them. They want to mandate that their constituents have to buy those cars because they are available today and they are not buying them. So they want to force them down your throat because you won't buy them. Let's talk about energy policy. You know what our energy policy is in this country? Our energy policy is no, we are not going to develop domestic energy, period. For 30 years, we have had the same people coming down here making the same arguments as to why we can't develop a domestic energy source. And it doesn't matter if it is natural gas or oil or hydro or solar or wind or what it is. It makes no difference. They are still a no. There is always a reason to be no. We had the Alaskan National Wildlife Refuge, and they vote ``no.'' We had a bill last year on the floor that expanded wind, solar, geothermal. They voted ``no.'' We have had the opportunity five times to vote on an energy bill that put money into alternative energy, renewable energy, conservation, and they voted ``no.'' No, no, no. No domestic energy, nothing for our constituents, for our businesses, for our economy. And what was the result of all of that? The result is that in the early 1970s and the mid-1970s, when we had our first energy crisis and OPEC cut us off and we had gas lines, we were dependent on foreign energy for 33 percent of our energy. In their 30 years of policy, today we depend on foreign countries for 66 percent of our energy. You can't be no on everything. Everything that has been proposed, no matter what it was, the answer was no. Now, you might think, well, they must have an alternative. There must be something else they want to do. Well, maybe it is, but they have failed to tell anybody, because they oppose everything. This bill was a compromise. This bill was a compromise between the 24 different bills that have been introduced in this Congress alone on offshore gas development, oil and gas development. Twenty-four bills. The two major bills, one was introduced by Mr. Peterson and Mr. Abercrombie, and it dealt mainly with natural gas. The other one by Mr. Melancon and Mr. Jindal. And we sat down and we tried to work out the differences between those bills. And, obviously, the coastal States have something to say about what happens off their coasts. I don't care how many times you come down here and rant and rave, the coastal States have something to say about what happens on their coasts. And we had to include them in this. We had to include them in the negotiations and them in the debate. And the decision was made that for the first time in our history that we would give the States, the coastal States, the ability to protect 100 miles off their coast. It would be up to the State legislature and the Governor for whether or not they wanted any kind of development. If they chose not to, they wouldn't get it. If they chose they want it, then it would be, the opportunity would be there for them to do it. And if they chose to, they would share in the revenue, exactly the way we do on onshore public lands. Exactly the same way. I am telling you, it is time to stop saying no. It is time to move forward with energy policy that makes sense for all of America, not just a small group of special interests who want to destroy our economy.","word.count":913,"sep11":4.92134831460674,"years":2006.7808988764,"days":4194,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.728727264976269,"Topic 2":0.0328713549050371,"Topic 3":0.0117860983751251,"Topic 4":0.0174754397495718,"Topic 5":0.0074271566540395,"Topic 6":0.157107913381701,"Topic 7":0.00757895144342097,"Topic 8":0.0231837670126615,"Topic 9":0.0110087112344605,"Topic 10":0.00283334226771293},{"id":"10419950140874","body":"Claiborne Pell: Mr. President, I reluctantly opposed the Conference Report on the National Highway System Act, S. 440. Back in February, I was pleased to join as an original cosponsor of S.440 since it would designate a National Highway System [NHS] to improve the Nation's key roads, comprising some 159,000 miles. The tenets of this bill were exemplary. In addition to providing some $6 billion in highway funding to the States, S. 440 was intended to improve safety through our highway system, as well as increase mobility and economic productivity. As for my State of Rhode Island, this measure would bring more than $31 million in Federal highway funding to help upgrade 267 miles of key roadways, including all 70 miles of interstate highways. When the Senate debated S. 440 earlier this summer, I was pleased to strongly support the amendment offered by my colleagues from Delaware which would have enabled States to provide a small portion of their funds to assist passenger rail services. I am disturbed that that amendment, which was overwhelmingly approved by the Senate by a 64-36 margin, did not emerge from the Conference Committee. I am also deeply disturbed, Mr. President, by the fact that the Senate provision to require a national maximum speed limit for trucks and buses was also dropped from the conference report. As an original cosponsor of S. 440, I am further disturbed that the final version which emerged from conference repeals Federal regulations on motorcycle helmet laws, while also allowing States to erect new billboards on scenic highways. Mr. President, I am aware that this was an exceptionally contentious conference with the House and do not in any way criticize the actions of my Senate colleagues. Indeed, Senators Chafee and Warner, longtime champions of highway safety provisions, fought hard to negotiate a fair compromise between the two divergent bills. I commend them for their tenacity and huge efforts to craft a good bill which would enhance our safety standards. I fully recognize the overall importance of this bill and the need to get the necessary funding back to the States. However, given the substantive changes that occurred in conference, my earlier enthusiasm has waned as my concern about safety provisions increased. Mr. President, my preference would have been for a leaner, cleaner NHS bill, something we in this Chamber supported with vigor. I am certain that we will attempt again to deal with the issues important to the Senate such as the Amtrak trust fund, speed limits on trucks and buses, and other motor vehicular safety laws. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my statement appear in the Record prior to the vote on S. 440. &lt;bullet&gt; Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to express my strong disagreement with this conference report. Although the bill does much good and is certainly necessary, it unfortunately contains numerous earmarks. While I understand that this is an authorization bill, the practical effect of these earmarks is to mandate spending on certain specific projects. It is as wrong here as it is when similar earmarks appear in appropriations legislation. I want to bring special attention to section 335, the innovative projects section of the bill. This section appears to be rife with earmarks. What are innovative projects? Well, Mr. President, they are nothing more than demonstration projects with a new--more innovative--name. The name, I would venture, has been changed because passing demonstration projects is no longer considered appropriate. I have introduced many amendments in this body to end all highway demonstration projects. Most recently, I offered an amendment that would ban any future demonstration projects. That amendment overwhelmingly passed the Senate. Mr. President, this section entitled ``Corrections to Innovative Projects'' would change existing law regarding numerous demonstration projects so that money can continue to be spent on projects in a certain select few States. For far too long, tax dollars sent to Washington by the citizens of most States are not returning to those States, but instead going to fund pet projects in other States. That is wrong, it is not fair, and it must be stopped. The problems associated with diverting highway trust fund money to pay for congressionally earmarked highway projects are well documented and have been debated before. I do not intend to belabor this point again now, except to note, however, that the practice continues. Mr. President, I would like to know what these so-called technical corrections actually entail. The report that accompanies this bill states the following: Mr. President, to this Senator--someone who is not an expert in these programs, but who is expected to vote on this matter--this clarification is not sufficient. Mr. President, again I want to repeat, this is an important bill and I am sure passing it is vital. But what is more vital is balancing the budget and paying down the debt, and continuing the practice of earmarking demonstration projects is exactly the wrong thing to do at this time. In Reinventing Government, Vice President Gore stated: The Reinventing Government report went on to say: Unfortunately this bill demonstrates that the Congress continues to find innovative ways to promote its most favored projects. If a project has merit, it should be a priority under the individual State's transportation plan. Highway funding should be distributed fairly according to establish formulas so that taxpayer's dollars can be spent according to the priorities established with such great care and expertise by those best qualified to do so--the individual States. Mr. President, I hope that we will end the practice of earmarking money for demonstration projects or innovative projects or any other similarly earmarked projects. The time has come to change our ways. I thank my colleagues for their indulgence.&lt;bullet&gt;","word.count":951,"sep11":-5.96910112359551,"years":1995.8904494382,"days":317,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0235288963865756,"Topic 2":0.306092286363338,"Topic 3":0.0034265872531576,"Topic 4":0.0497710929689743,"Topic 5":0.00236457885400785,"Topic 6":0.466404134603964,"Topic 7":0.106894585966357,"Topic 8":0.00470595825426436,"Topic 9":0.0222003231759132,"Topic 10":0.0146115561734482},{"id":"11020080033608","body":"Charles W. Boustany Jr.: Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume I rise today in support of H.R. 6890 which would extend the authority of the Secretary of Education to waive certain requirements for those States impacted by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The legislation would also ensure that those school districts that experienced widespread damage by the severe storms, tornadoes, or flooding in the Midwest or hurricanes in the gulf coast receive the same amount of funding under the title I program as they did last year. I want to thank my fellow members of the Louisiana delegation for working with me in introducing this bill and their ongoing work alongside with me to assist those impacted by the devastating natural disasters that have hit the gulf coast as well as the Midwest. Mr. Speaker, the events over the past month when Hurricane Ike hit the Texas and Louisiana coast and Hurricane Gustav hit the Louisiana coast remind us of the damaging impact that natural disasters have on our Nation's residents and their local communities. As thousands of residents return to their homes and towns, they'll need help in rebuilding their houses and their livelihoods. Local elementary and secondary schools--both public and private--will need help in replacing textbooks and other instructional materials so that students can get back to learning and a little bit of normalcy. Just over 3 years ago, our Nation experienced one of the worst disasters in our history when Hurricanes Katrina and Rita devastated Louisiana and the Mississippi gulf coast. More than 1,100 public and private schools were forced to close, and approximately 158,000 students were displaced as a direct result of the hurricanes. The loss of business and government infrastructure, jobs, and housing deprived school districts of local property taxes that normally fund school operations. In the Midwest, we know that the massive flooding experienced over the summer in Iowa and recently in Illinois has devastated local communities and schools. Louisiana and Texas are still assessing the damage done as a result of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike, but the initial assessments paint a grim picture. In the aftermath of these natural disasters, Congress should assist those public and private elementary, middle, and high schools that are struggling to re-open and re-enroll students for families returning to these devastated areas. In 2006, we provided funds to States and public and private schools in the gulf region impacted by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita to replace instructional materials, recover student and personnel data systems, and other important services to get schools back up and running. We also guaranteed that those school districts in the gulf coast receive the same amount of funding under the title I program for fiscal year 2006 as they received for fiscal year 2005. We provided the Secretary of Education with limited authority to waive certain financial requirements to ensure that those states that were heavily impacted by the destruction could use several funds to meet their financial commitments. These waivers have proven critical to the recovery of schools in several impacted areas and enabled them to access much-needed reconstruction funds. The bill we have before us today, H.R. 6890, would extend this temporary authority for another fiscal year through September 30, 2009. As we continue to assess the damage in the Midwest and along the gulf coast, similar to the assistance provided back in 2006, H.R. 6890 also guarantees that those school districts in the Midwest impacted by flooding and the gulf coast impacted by Hurricanes Gustav and Ike receive the same amount of funding under the title I program for this upcoming school year as they received for the last school year. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6890. I'm thankful to the committee and to the gentlelady from California for bringing this resolution to the floor. I reserve the balance of my time.","word.count":643,"sep11":7.21348314606742,"years":2009.07303370787,"days":5010,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.235663424304154,"Topic 2":0.0268804773244844,"Topic 3":0.00758315472863093,"Topic 4":0.0803602868611378,"Topic 5":0.00210265498731575,"Topic 6":0.460574500941482,"Topic 7":0.114617859105335,"Topic 8":0.0121621134851024,"Topic 9":0.0589529439391037,"Topic 10":0.00110258432325342},{"id":"10419950056649","body":"Rosa L.

Now, what the TEAM Act says is that it is perfectly permissible for an employer to sit down with a group of his employees and say, what do you think is the best way to make this place more efficient? Or how can we make this place safer? Or what can we do to increase our productivity? Now, apparently--and I must say I was stunned to learn this--that is illegal. You cannot do that. Now, of course, it is happening across the country, but if it is discovered it is illegal, you can be hauled up before the National Labor Relations Board. There is something about this that has an Alice in Wonderland complex to it. What is going on in the United States of America when an employer cannot say to a group of workers out there, the fellow down the road is producing our product at a lower price and faster than we are. What can we do to improve our productivity? And so they give him some suggestions. But it turns out that is against the law. It is against the National Labor Relations Act which was passed in 1935. So we are held up, ensnarled in an act that was passed 61 years ago. So what this act, introduced by the Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum], reported out of the committee, says is that there are certain things you can do. No, you cannot do collective bargaining with a group of employees like that. That is separate. But certainly you can sit down and decide how you are going to increase productivity or how you are going to make the place safer or what can we do to make it more attractive to get other workers to come and join with us in this effort. That is what this is all about. The mere idea that we need a law to do this seems to me--I must say I never dreamed this would be required. Frankly, when they started talking about the TEAM Act, I did not know what it was and had to have somebody spell it out. So that is why we are here today. This is vigorously resisted by the unions, and it is vigorously resisted by the administration. The administration has gone so far as to say if this law is passed, this TEAM Act, it will be vetoed. I must say I think that is unwarranted and extremely shortsighted. There are two factors, it seems to me, that make it very important we pass this legislation. First--and this is no secret to anybody who is watching this or in the galleries or anywhere--American industry is in the fight of its life against competition. We now have a global economy, no question about it. Something made in China or the Philippines or in the Caribbean nations comes into the United States and is sold is competition. So we in this country have seen the loss of tens of thousands of high-paying American jobs. I have seen this regrettably in my State to a considerable degree. So what this intense competition abroad has required is for American industry to produce better products at a lower price, increase productivity and be more efficient in every fashion. So this painful but necessary reexamination has required more intensive labor and management cooperation than in the past. The second thing that has taken place--the first is the global competition. We have to compete or our jobs will not survive--our laws have not kept pace and in many ways impede our progress toward reaching this global competitiveness. Labor law must change just like manufacturing processes must change or cooperation has to be greater. And that is true of labor laws likewise. Labor laws have to reflect the need for cooperation and teamwork that is critical for our survival. The National Labor Relations Act, as I previously mentioned, was enacted in 1935 and has changed very little in those ensuing 61 years. Unfortunately, that law is rooted in adversarial--when that law was passed in 1933, it was there to take care of a situation. At that time, there was great turbulence in our industries. There was an adversarial situation between labor and management. Indeed, workers were prohibited from organizing in many States. They were prohibited from going on strike. All of that changed in the early 1930's with the National Labor Relations Act and other laws such as that. The act, as I say, has not been adequately changed in the 61 years that have passed, and it does not recognize that now there is a great deal of cooperation that is needed in our factories and workplaces, so efforts to increase workplace cooperation were substantially hindered in 1992 by a decision called the Electromation case. That was a National Labor Relations Board case some 4 years ago. In that case, the National Labor Relations Board said that employers and employee committees which talk about attendance--people are not getting to work on time. What is going on around here? What can we do to increase the attendance? We have a lot of people who are not showing up. We have some people who work a 4-day week when they are meant to be here 5 days. What can we do about it? What can we do about no-smoking policies? What do you want? Do you want a separate place to smoke? Do you want no smoking? What do you want? It was decided you cannot do that. You cannot even talk to your employees about what is the best smoking policy or no-smoking policy. This act we are talking about today, called the TEAM Act, would simply conform labor law with what is already happening. As I say, all across our country there are, in fact, these committees, and our managers and our owners of these companies do not realize it is against the law. Indeed, there are some 30,000 of these labor/management committees across the country. But if any one of them is discovered, it could well be that it is in violation of the National Labor Relations Act and could be punished with fines of a very severe nature. It is said that this bill is a threat to labor unions. I must say, I do not understand the rationale for that argument. This bill specifically states in its language that the committees that are entitled to be formed under this act cannot negotiate, cannot amend existing collective bargaining agreements. All they can do is talk about better productivity, talk about greater efficiency and matters of that nature. As has been mentioned previously, the hitch is that the law says employers cannot enter into the formation of any organization that deals with these problems that I have mentioned: attendance, productivity, efficiency. This, as I further mentioned, has received a very broad interpretation from the National Labor Relations Board. So it makes illegal most of those employee-involvement committees that I previously dealt with and mentioned. What we seek in this act is to have some clear definition of what we might call a safe harbor. What is a safe harbor? A safe harbor is an area where the employer knows it is safe for him to enter into discussions with employees without running afoul of the law. That is what this is all about. The TEAM Act is this safe harbor. It would do nothing to undermine union organizing or collective bargaining. It would recognize and authorize a simple fact of life: Employers are, indeed, nowadays looking to their employees more than ever before to help them, the employers, have a better workplace, a smarter workplace, a more efficient workplace, a more successful workplace that, hopefully, will result in more jobs, not only for those employees and their families but others across our Nation. This is very simple. It is a good idea that, as I say, I am stunned it is causing this furor, this fuss, because it ought to be adopted, I think, unanimously. Democrats and Republicans and unions all ought to embrace something that is going to make our country more efficient. I do hope this TEAM Act, S. 295, will be adopted, and I thank the Chair.","word.count":1402,"sep11":-5.48033707865169,"years":1996.37921348315,"days":491,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.00724052726637294,"Topic 2":0.158612488578864,"Topic 3":0.00802683158343513,"Topic 4":0.00928533455643871,"Topic 5":0.02811489877165,"Topic 6":0.59328962604811,"Topic 7":0.0240696631597885,"Topic 8":0.0104842220009038,"Topic 9":0.0692029764328162,"Topic 10":0.0916734316016215},{"id":"10920050059373","body":"John McCain: Mr. President, we have just heard a very powerful and moving statement from the senior Senator from Montana, and we all understand he has suffered a deep and personal loss.

The chairman of the committee has been a very valued asset to me personally, and I thank him for that leadership. Also to my subcommittee chairmen, the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Ewing] and the gentleman from Nebraska [Mr. Barrett], who have just done a super job in bringing us forward. And I thank the gentleman from Missouri [Mr. Emerson] and the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Combest] for their valued friendship and leadership. I cannot leave out the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Gunderson]. He has just worked so diligently, the particularly in the area of dairy. To my friend, the gentleman from Texas [Mr. de la Garza], we on the other side of the aisle have had our disagreements certainly, but it has always been in a very professional and a very courteous manner, and I commend him for his leadership over there. Agriculture has always been the backbone of the economy of this country. I come from the largest agriculture county in the State of Georgia. Agriculture drives our State, and certainly agriculture drives my home county and the people there. Less than 2 percent of the people of this country feed 100 percent of the people of this country. We provide the safest, finest quality of food products on the shelves of our grocery stores of anybody in the world. We spend less than 10 cents out of every dollar on food products, whereas other industrialized countries like Japan spend over 20 cents out of every single dollar for food products. We are able to do that because of strong agriculture programs that we have in this country that provided those safe, high- quality products and we have been able to stabilize the retail cost of agricultural products over the years. But times are changing. We are moving into the 21st century. The Agricultural Marketing Transition Act moves us in the direction. I commend the chairman, and I urge the support of that bill.

Holt: Mr. President, as we close tonight, I want everyone within the sound of my voice to understand this: We are working on a very important piece of legislation, the reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration--the agency responsible for making sure aircraft is safe and reliable. Right now, we have an antiquated system. This legislation will do what has been needed for a long time to change the way we do aviation in this country. All the experts say it is long past due. We have had hard work for a long period of time. This bill is way overdue. Senator Rockefeller has worked very hard in bringing the product to the floor. It is a good product. We had an issue today that came up, and Senator Rockefeller offered an amendment which takes away that as an issue. My friends, the Republicans, obviously, want to kill this bill to add to the other list they have sent to the graveyard. They are using an excuse: Well, we don't have the ability to offer amendments. Mr. President, I have offered them anything possible to make sure they can offer all the amendments they want. The distinguished Senator from Texas, Mrs. Kay Bailey Hutchison, obviously does not like some of the tax portions of this bill. Offer an amendment to try to take them out. I have offered the Republican leader: Give us a list of the amendments you want to offer. This is very standard procedure around here. No response to that. It is very obvious to me this is an effort to kill this bill. Let's be logical. We are on the floor. I have said: Any amendments you want to offer that are germane or relevant to this bill, you can do that. Now, that is very wide. It allows anything that relates basically to transportation to be offered on this bill. But they have turned that down. They have broken all records for filibuster--they, the Republicans. On this one, on the motion to proceed, I said on the floor earlier this week, this was not their fault. We did not have the substitute Senators Rockefeller and Baucus had worked on. It was not ready until Monday night. But it was ready Tuesday morning, and they had every opportunity to work at that time and give us a list of amendments they wanted to do. We would give them ours. I was told today, when the Durbin amendment was filed, that they wanted to offer the next amendment. They wanted to offer it from Senator Bunning. No problem. We have been waiting all day for the language of that amendment, which is probably nonexistent. We have been fair. We have been reasonable. But, obviously, we are now at a point where they are back to their old tricks and just killing the bill. They should just tell us this rather than play the games. They should say: We do not want this bill. I have spoken to the Republican leader saying: If we really want to get this bill done, why don't I file cloture then, because no one seems to be wanting to offer any amendments. He said: No, it's too early. You have not allowed us to offer any amendments. I say: Offer amendments. So this is really, Mr. President, a typical procedure around here, that the minority, wanting to maintain the status quo with air travel, as everything else, puts us in a position where we have no alternative but to either pull the bill or file cloture, and they said they will not give us the extra nine votes we need. Remember, Mr. President, this bill has, for example, the Passenger Bill of Rights in it so that when people are held up on a flight--you are on a runway for hours at a time--there are certain rights passengers have. All those things that cause so much consternation when you are trying to travel on an airplane--the Passenger Bill of Rights addresses many of those. But with Republicans that will go down the tubes with everything else in this bill.","word.count":277,"sep11":6.25561797752809,"years":2008.11516853933,"days":4669,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.10835862385273,"Topic 2":0.427433141817266,"Topic 3":0.00341554234678074,"Topic 4":0.00284572956666967,"Topic 5":0.44727560121886,"Topic 6":0.00147264618304241,"Topic 7":0.00122368471630119,"Topic 8":0.00263115341127629,"Topic 9":0.00138325594435648,"Topic 10":0.00396062094271687},{"id":"10419960075548","body":"Larry Craig: I thank my chairman for yielding to me Let me close with this thought.

I think all of us here would understand and be sympathetic to the notion that, if there are situations in our trading relations where you have a company that is hard pressed and disadvantaged against competition, as some of our companies are in certain industries, then it is conceivable that you can make a legitimate argument that you want to find some kind of Government subsidy to redress the imbalance in the marketplace. I know, for instance, that Airbus received significant subsidies. And Boeing and McDonnell Douglas have to compete against the French, or against other countries in those industries where there is a very significant subsidy. But here we have a situation where companies that are extraordinarily profitable are going to sell their products abroad anyway for which there is a market for those products anyway, where they are profitable beyond any of the need criteria that you might try to establish, and nevertheless the taxpayers of this country are simply reimbursing them for a subsidy for an advertising budget that they would expend anyway. Let me be very explicit about that. The M&amp;M Mars company, for instance, has about a $262 million advertising budget. They spend that no matter what. When a company spokesman was asked, ``What do you think about taking these Government funds?'' the company spokesman's answer was, ``Well, you know, it is sort of like the mortgage interest rate deduction. If it is there, you take advantage of it.'' So they take advantage of the funds. It is not even a question of being need based. At a time when everyone is looking for a responsible way to make judgments, critical judgments about who deserves Government assistance and who does not, it is simply wrong--it is just wrong, wrong economically, wrong politically, wrong morally, wrong on every kind of balance--to suggest that these companies with their--look at Tyson Foods. What is Tyson Foods doing getting a subsidy at this point in time for this? I like Tyson Foods. I like what they do. We are enormously proud of what they have accomplished and of what they are capable of doing. But at a time when we are being asked to cut back on education funding, on environmental cleanup, on science research, on the R&amp;D tax credit, on all kinds of things that are important, how can you justify this kind of effort? There are some small companies, there are some people working at a great disadvantage in the international marketplace against countries that have a much greater degree of assistance and of partnership between the Government and the private sector than we do that may need some kind of leverage. It is with that in mind that the Senator from Nevada and those of us who are promoting a change are not suggesting, even though we think this is not an appropriate program overall, we think that it is fair to recognize those small areas of need and simply to cut this program back to the $70 million cap. When you measure this particular program and whatever justifications are given for it against the extraordinary reductions that we are facing in title I funds, in drug free safe school money, in Pell grants, in student loans, in environmental enforcement, in infrastructure development, in science and research, in global climate change research--you can run down the gambit and every one of those fundamental needs are being reduced--how can you justify continuing this kind of corporate welfare? I think most Americans are not even aware that this kind of subsidy is taking place, and every American that I have ever talked to, when you explain to them what is happening, their eyes bug out and they simply are aghast at the notion that this is what people in Washington are choosing to do with their money. The American citizen knows this is inappropriate, it is unnecessary, and measured against all the other choices that we are making in Washington it is plain and simply wrong. I am grateful to the Senator from Nevada for being willing to lead the charge here in an effort to try to redress it. I hope the Senate will once again vote as it did previously. We won this battle in the Senate. Unfortunately, as is so often the case here in Washington, the interests come into the conference committee or get one or two people to hold up everything and so it was taken out in the conference, and here we are back again. This is the same history that we had on a mink subsidy and on the wool and mohair subsidy, and ultimately we will win this battle because it is the right thing to do.

The subcommittee also heard testimony from Dr. Duane Alexander, Director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development; Dr. Kent McGuire, Assistant Secretary of Education, Office of Educational Research and Improvement; and Dr. Donald N. Langenberg, Chairman of the National Reading Panel and Chancellor of the University System of Maryland. The National Reading Panel was created as a result of legislation I introduced in 1997, titled the ``Successful Reading Research and Instruction Act.'' Subsequently, the report accompanying the Fiscal Year 1998 Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies Appropriations Act called on the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the Department of Education to form a panel to evaluate existing research on the teaching of reading to children, identify proven methodologies, and suggest ways for dissemination of this information to teachers, parents, universities and others. I was convinced at the time that there was an absence of consensus on a national strategy for teaching children to read. Meanwhile, we had statistics which showed that 40 to 60 percent of elementary students were not reading proficiently and there seemed to be no plan to help remedy the situation. The Health Research Extension Act of 1985 had mandated research on why children have difficulties learning to read. The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development had conducted this research and in 1997, they had some answers. However, Congress hadn't asked for the results and the information was literally trapped in the academic and research world. Since 1997, we've made some progress. Today more people know that reading research exists, but very few of us are able to decipher what it means, or how to translate it into meaningful practice. Mr. President, what most parents want to know is simple, ``How can I make sure my child will learn to read?'' Until now, the response to that question was often vague, and the so-called ``expert'' or ``research based'' methods were conflicting. Consequently, there is a great deal of confusion among parents, teachers and school administrators about improving reading skills of children. Meanwhile, the Federal government has spent nearly $100 million on programs which one researcher described as, ``at best, it shouldn't hurt.'' The National Reading Panel identified over 100,000 studies on a variety of topics related to reading instruction. It held regional hearings to receive testimony from teachers, parents, students, university faculty, educational policy experts and scientists who represented the population that would ultimately be the users of its findings. The panel used the information from these hearings and their preliminary research to identify five topics for intensive study: alphabetics; fluency; comprehension; teacher education and reading instruction; and computer technology and reading instruction. The panel then narrowed its review to materials which met a defined set of rigorous research methodological standards. It is the development of these standards which the panel describes as ``what may be its most important action.'' By finding successful techniques that meet the same kind of scientific review that are used to test medical treatments, the panel presents its recommendations with a confidence that has never before been applied to the teaching of reading. One of the National Reading Panel's objectives was to ensure that good research results were readily available. On April 13, the report was sent to every Senator and Member of Congress. Within the next few weeks, the report and supporting documentation will be delivered to state education officials, colleges and universities, and public libraries. A long-term strategic plan that will address wider dissemination and classroom implementation will be ready by next fall. It is my hope that the report of the National Reading Panel will guide us in making informed decisions on reading issues. I commend the efforts of the National Reading Panel and I hope educators will implement their recommendations and use the new teaching methods and programs outlined in the report.","word.count":672,"sep11":-1.41573033707865,"years":2000.44382022472,"days":1938,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0124571720961308,"Topic 2":0.348512078981033,"Topic 3":0.00252991600338345,"Topic 4":0.00421614284567034,"Topic 5":0.581394914447867,"Topic 6":0.00146089744382398,"Topic 7":0.0019828181855829,"Topic 8":0.0134413112649188,"Topic 9":0.0131131005567167,"Topic 10":0.0208916481748736},{"id":"10720010010237","body":"Stephanie Jones: Mr. Speaker, I would like to take the opportunity on the House floor this evening to express my concerns regarding the continued transfer of missile technology from China to Pakistan. The Bush administration has reported that the transfer of this highly sensitive information persists even today. Mr. Speaker, in May 1996, China pledged to not provide technological assistance to nuclear facilities in countries such as Pakistan, where such facilities are not safeguarded. However, Chinese authorities did not effectively ban technology transfers which continued to take place after May of 1996. In November 2000, China entered into an agreement with the Clinton administration that prohibited China from transferring missiles or missile technology to specifically Pakistan. Apparently, missile technology transfers continued even after this specific prohibition. Mr. Speaker, what concerns me is that John Bolton, Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and Security has said that the Bush administration's policy on the illegal export of missile technology from China to Pakistan has not changed since the Clinton administration, which on November 21, 2000 imposed sanctions on Pakistan for engaging in missile technology proliferation activities with China. But from my understanding, the Bush administration has already waived substantially all of the missile technology control regime sanctions previously imposed against Pakistan citing the authority of S. 1465, which provided the President with increased flexibility in the exercise of his waiver authority with respect to Pakistan. I am extremely disappointed that the Bush administration would publicize that its policy has not changed since the Clinton administration, even though the opposite is true and that the Clinton prohibition was recently waived under President Bush's authority. In addition, I cannot emphasize strongly enough how important it is that missile technology transfers from China to Pakistan be terminated. The current political situation in Pakistan is extremely unstable given their military dictator Musharraf's standing as president and the escalating conflict in Kashmir. Further, there are reports that Osama bin Laden, members of al Qaeda and the Taliban may have shifted into Pakistan. Bin Laden has been known to confer with nuclear scientists in the past. And it is imperative that no further missile or nuclear technology information be filtered into Pakistan for fear of the information getting into deadly hands. Mr. Speaker, the administration has the authority to reauthorize the prohibition of November 2000 that mandates China not transfer missiles or missile technology to Pakistan. I sent a letter to President Bush today, which I would like to include in the Record, Mr. Speaker, requesting that the prohibition be put back in place. The letter is as follows: Mr. Speaker, this is a matter of not only security in the South Asia region but is a national security concern as well.

This budget plan, like last year's, undermines basic protections for children and the elderly, raises taxes on the working poor, and denies educational opportunity to millions of Americans, all to pay for the lavish tax breaks for the wealthy. If this budget plan becomes law, Medicare would be cut by $167 billion over 6 years, Medicaid would be cut by $72 billion at the Federal level and some $250 billion in the States by the year 2002, with the change in the formulas which have been developed in this proposal. Education will be cut $25 billion. Yesterday, I addressed the Senate on this issue, pointing out what a mistake this really is, when we find out that the number of children who are going to be going to the high schools in this country is going to increase by 8 percent. We are going to go up to about 53 or 54 million children in the next 2 years. The number of traditional college-age students will increase by 12 percent. As a result, even a current services budget is failing to adjust to those particular new realities and the funding that is included in this budget fails by about $20 billion to even come close to it. This is in contrast to the President's program that continues our ongoing commitment in the field of education. Under this Republican budget, the earned-income tax credit will be cut $18 billion. That is the tax credit which is available to working families, phased out at approximately $28,000 to $30,000, and principally available to working families with children. All of these cuts would be made in order to bestow a lavish windfall of $122 billion to $180 billion, as Mr. Kasich has pointed out in the House of Representatives, for tax breaks for the wealthiest individuals in the Nation. Mr. President, 42 percent of the mandatory cuts in this misguided budget come from programs that help the neediest families and individuals in the Nation; 47 percent of the tax breaks will go to those making over $100,000 a year. Meanwhile, corporate special interests are not asked to ante up a single nickel. The corporate welfare part of our budget, which is expenditures which otherwise could be used for deficit reduction, will be over $4 trillion over the period of the next 7 years--$4 trillion. Yet there is not $1 of savings from tax expenditures in the Republican budget. There is not one expenditure that is out there in the Federal Tax Code that is being eliminated by the Republican budget program. We hear so often about how we have too many programs, programs that do not work, and many of us have been trying to address that issue. We had a good program to try to deal with the proliferation of job training programs under an excellent bipartisan bill that Senator Kassebaum and I worked on. It passed the Senate overwhelmingly in this Congress. We still have hopes about that program. We have been consolidating health programs and consolidating education programs in the period of recent years. But we cannot find, in the Republican budget, 1 nickel to save from some inefficient tax expenditures that may be enticing American corporations to go overseas and take American jobs with them--not one. The President's program has $40 billion in savings. It seems to me we ought to be able to go up even significantly above that proposal. But there is not one--not one--in the Republican program. Medicare cuts are a prime example of the Republican priorities. They are no less devastating simply because they sound familiar. The Medicare cuts have not improved with age. Last year the Republican plan was a thinly veiled attack on the entire concept of Medicare. It was designed to cause Medicare to ``wither on the vine,'' in the words of Speaker Gingrich, by forcing senior citizens to give up their family doctor and join the private insurance programs. When Republicans took up the issues of Medicare cuts last year, they proposed to cut the program by $270 billion--three times more than the amount the Medicare trustees said was needed to protect the solvency of the trust fund. You cannot listen to a speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate without our good Republican friends saying we have to pass this in order to deal with the potential bankruptcy of the trust fund. The fact is, they are cutting the Medicare Program three times the amount that the trustees say is necessary in order to protect the solvency of the trust funds. This year, the Republicans are proposing to cut $167 billion from Medicare. By contrast, the President's plan cuts it $116 billion, 44 percent less. Yet it guarantees the Medicare solvency for a decade and funds Medicare at the level necessary to assure that quality care will be available for senior citizens when they need it. Even worse, Republicans support an inflexible ceiling on Medicare spending. Consequently, if inflation is higher or medical needs are greater than anticipated, Medicare spending will not go up as it should, and many senior citizens will be out of luck and out of care. The President's plan has the right savings and right priorities. It provides ample time for Congress and the administration to work together to find the longer run solutions we need to deal honestly with Medicare's problems and preserve the quality of health care for the elderly. In fact, we can take many steps to reduce Medicare costs without cutting the quality of benefits, without raising premiums, but these steps are not what the Republicans are proposing. Another false Republican argument in defense of their Medicare cuts is that the reductions are not really cuts, because the total amount of Medicare spending will continue to grow. That argument was addressed, I thought, very effectively by the ranking minority member of the Budget Committee, Senator Exon, last evening. But every household in America knows that if the cost of your rent and the cost of your utilities and the cost of food go up and your income stays the same or goes up less rapidly, you have taken a real cut in your living standard, and that is what is at issue. In my own State of Massachusetts, the number of frail elderly, those who are 85 years old, is going to double in the period of the next 5 years, let alone the total number of elderly that is going to grow. This is a real national phenomenon, a demographic phenomenon. We are blessed to have our parents with longer and extended lives, and to try and play shell games, in terms of the quality of care for our seniors, I think, is particularly unacceptable when we are balancing that with tax breaks for wealthy individuals. Republicans speak of a cut in defense, when defense spending does not increase by enough to offset rising costs. Apparently, the same Republican logic does not apply to spending on Medicare that applies to spending on guns, tanks and other weapons. A cut is a cut is a cut, whether it is in Medicare, Social Security, or national defense. Even more damaging than the loss of billions of dollars that Republicans would slash from Medicare is their attempt to turn it over to the private insurance industry. The Republican budget contains a number of changes to force senior citizens to give up their own doctors and join private insurance plans. Once they are forced into these plans, senior citizens will be stripped of many of the protections they enjoy today--protections against overcharges by doctors and other health providers, what we call double billing. The doctors, rather than taking what is allocated to them under the Medicare Program, say, ``Pay in full.'' Under current law, the seniors are protected from paying additional kinds of costs, but there is no such requirement if they go into private health insurance. They could be billed once and then be charged again. That is a problem that is readily understood. We thought we addressed that in amendments that I and others had offered earlier on the budget resolution, but those protections were discarded in the conference. There were protections against premium gouging and profiteering by insurance companies, protection of their right to keep their own family doctor and go to the specialist of their choice. Republicans claim they want to offer senior citizens a choice, but this is a choice no senior citizen should be forced to make. I offered a sense-of-the-Congress resolution that was adopted by the full Senate stating that reconciliation should not include proposals to eliminate these protections. It specifically reaffirmed that private insurance plans should be prohibited from leveling premium surcharges for basic Medicare services, and the doctors should not be allowed to strap on extra charges to seniors participating in such plans. That proposal was dropped by the Republicans in the House-Senate conference. The Republican assault on Medicare is painfully clear, and the American people will never support this anti-elderly special interest agenda. Republicans deny that their Medicare cuts will fund tax breaks for the wealthy. This time the leopard claims that it really has changed its spots, but the Republican budget clearly anticipates $60 billion in revenue increases from tax extenders and closing of selected corporate loopholes in order to fund $60 billion in new taxes for the undeserving rich. Without those lavish tax breaks, they would not need to cut Medicare by $167 billion. The Medicare trust fund should not be a slush fund for tax breaks for the rich. There are appropriate ways to reduce Medicare spending and improve the quality at the same time. Mr. President, we have had extensive hearings in this body, chaired by our friend and colleague Senator Harkin, that has reviewed in very careful detail the billions of dollars that can be saved under Medicare by dealing more effectively with fraud and abuse. We can save tens of billions of dollars from unnecessary hospitaliza","word.count":845,"sep11":-5.97752808988764,"years":1995.88202247191,"days":314,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.01786285853606,"Topic 2":0.0122781499366788,"Topic 3":0.00571391860348011,"Topic 4":0.00212316473483554,"Topic 5":0.301560197805797,"Topic 6":0.00200858757776836,"Topic 7":0.00225521002111826,"Topic 8":0.587112698293059,"Topic 9":0.00378948190857274,"Topic 10":0.0652957325826296},{"id":"10419950126956","body":"Barbara Boxer: Mr. President, the first paragraph says: My friend, that is what this is about.

One is the war, and then the economy. As we started losing economic ground, a downturn back in March of 2000, people didn't realize for every 1 percent change in economic activity it translated into $45 billion in revenue. In other words, as the economy is rebounding now, the revenue is coming back up. Even continuing in the effort, the war effort--which I am afraid is going to last for quite a while--we are going to be facing end strength problems and that will have to go on. I believe the best thing we can do is do it through the economy. At the same time there are certain things that have to happen in America. We have to do something about roads in America. I probably have as many townhall meetings as anyone. I suggest the Senator from Florida does, too. I can't remember one I have had where they haven't said something about roads. In Oklahoma what they say is, we can always tell when we are around Thanksgiving time, when we have family coming in, we have friends coming in, we can always know when we get to Oklahoma because of the roads. I add to the Presiding Officer, when they come from Texas they make that comment about Oklahoma roads. So we do have a very serious problem. It seems to be more serious in my State. Part of that is due to the donor status we have had for quite some time. Of course, we have not had the money with which to do it. I feel an obligation, and believe it is very appropriate for conservatives, to get out and vote in favor of this type of an infrastructure program. This translates directly into jobs, translates directly into the economy, translates directly into increasing economic activity and additional revenue that will come into Government.

During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. This rule waives all points of order against the conference report for H.R. 1350 and against its consideration, and provides that the conference report shall be considered as read. Mr. Speaker, shortly after my second son, Alex, was born in 1994, my father gave me some healthy words of advice when he said that Alex Sessions would be the greatest thing that would ever happen to our family. He knew and understood that in fact Alex was a very special baby. He was born with Downs Syndrome. The past 10 years have reaffirmed my father's words to me, and Alex has become one of the greatest parts of our family's life. Ten years later, Alex is a very happy third grader at Lakewood Elementary in Dallas, Texas; and Alex has the support of numerous teachers, students, and parents who provide him with remarkable educational lessons and invaluable friendships. For each of the last 2 years, Alex has been rewarded with the school's highest citizenship honor, to be a Lakewood Super Stallion. In the last 3 weeks, Alex has successfully written for the first time his first and last name. While these are great personal achievements for Alex and our entire family, stories like these are being told all across the country because of the extra efforts of those dedicated educators who are working diligently with these wonderful children under landmark Federal legislation known as IDEA, or Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Several decades ago, Congress passed this legislation to guarantee children with disabilities full access to a fulfilling and appropriate public education. And while I have talked today about the many successes and achievements of this important program, there are also areas within the law that could and can use improvement and adjustment. I am proud to support the bipartisan legislation that is before us today to reauthorize and improve this most important education program to ensure that the true promise and intent of this act is carried out to the fullest extent of our abilities as Congressmen. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1350 creates an educational atmosphere focusing on the future of our most vulnerable children. It builds on the existing strengths of IDEA, while modernizing and improving the program to guarantee that children with disabilities have the most appropriate tools to fully utilize their gifts. The changes that we are making in IDEA will give children measurable goals to ensure they reach their postsecondary living and employment goals. H.R. 1350 directly addresses perhaps the greatest problem facing IDEA, the effective monitoring and enforcement of the act. Effective July 1, 2005, it will give the Secretary of Education clear authority to enforce standards to monitor and enforce whether or not schools are in compliance with IDEA, authority that has been lacking since the inception of this education initiative. States will be empowered to create an acceptable set of standards; and if they are not met, the Secretary of Education will now have the tools necessary to take appropriate and reasonable action to work with State and local educators to remedy the situation. This conference report provides Congress with a 6-year glidepath to fully fund IDEA by 2011. Under President Bush's leadership, funding for all education programs, in particular IDEA, have been a high priority. In his first term, President Bush increased IDEA funding to States by $4.8 billion, or what we would know as a 76 percent increase. This Republican-controlled Congress, which I am proud to be a part of, has increased the Federal share of IDEA funding to 19 percent in 10 years, whereas our predecessors in the Democrat-controlled Congresses only allowed the Federal share of IDEA costs to reach 7 percent. H.R. 1350 also restores trust and constructive dialogue to the relationship between parents and school personnel promoting an earlier resolution to problems before they end up in court. This legislation creates the opportunity for a resolution session within 30 days of a complaint being filed to quickly resolve the problem. The constant threat of litigation creates an atmosphere of distrust between parents and schools, an environment that harms everyone involved. Today's legislation also solves another problem that has plagued IDEA for too long. Today, many children with reading problems are misidentified as learning disabled and wrongly placed in special education classes, a costly mistake which siphons away valuable funding from students who truly need IDEA services. To address this issue, H.R. 1350 requires districts with significant over-identifying of students to operate early intervention programs to reduce over-identification, eliminating the outdated IQ discrepancy, a model that relies on a wait- to-fail approach, and introduces a response to intervention model that identifies specific learning disabilities before the students are at a failing grade level. I am proud of this new IDEA legislation. Because of the important resources that H.R. 1350 provides to our schools, it may one day help my son Alex to further meet his goals of learning to read. I am pleased to note that the House version of this legislation successfully passed through the Committee on Education and the Workforce, and then through the House in April of 2003. Today's conference report enjoys the overwhelming bipartisan support of its conferees, and I am confident that this report will enjoy wide bipartisan margins in both Houses before it is signed by President Bush. I would ask that all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle demonstrate their commitment to the special education needs of our country's disabled children by supporting this conference report. I would like to thank the House sponsor of this legislation, the gentleman from Delaware , and the chairman of the Committee on Education and the Workforce, the gentleman from Ohio , for their dedicated hard work in producing the conference report. I would also like to take a minute to commend the conferees from both bodies that have labored to produce this fine product, including the gentleman from California , Senator Edward Kennedy, and Senator Judd Gregg. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this rule and the underlying legislation.

It is that simple. Many States, as we know, have laws saying a parent or guardian has to be notified if a child is trying to get an abortion. But not all States have these laws. What is happening now, far too often in this country, is that people who aren't parents, who aren't guardians, are taking these children across State lines, secretly, to get abortions in another State where parental notification is not required. It is that simple. What we are addressing in this bill, and what Senator Abraham is addressing, is an obvious circumvention of these State parental consent and notification laws. This bill, then, has two purposes: to protect the health of children and to protect the rights of parents. In fact, it might not be much of an exaggeration to say that these two purposes really boil down to just one purpose, because, Mr. President, empowering parents is the single biggest investment we can make in ensuring the health of our children. What we are saying with this legislation is that, yes, parents have the right to be involved in a moral and medical decision that affects their children's welfare. They have the right to do this. They have the duty to do this. When it comes to parental notification on abortion, the American people have reached a clear consensus. By a huge majority, 80 percent, favor parental notification; 74 percent favor not just parental notification but parental consent, as well--74 percent. This is a clear expression of the national wisdom. This legislation is an effort to make that kind of informed decision possible. Now, earlier this year, we in Congress worked on another bill, one that is now law. In that bill, the President and the Congress mandated that the flight of a parent to another State to avoid paying child support would be a Federal crime. I worked with Senator Kohl to champion the Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act in order to protect the interests of America's children. We have to pursue very vigorously those who would harm our children, either by omission or by commission. Mr. President, the very same principle is embodied in the Child Custody Protection Act that we are considering today. There are those living among us, Mr. President, who would place our children in harm's way by transporting them across State lines to achieve dangerous goals, both physically and emotionally. One such goal is abortion. The right of citizens to pass and enforce laws regarding the rights of parents is completely violated by the ability of others to transport children to another State to obtain an abortion. As a Nation, we must use all the resources available to us in order to protect our children and our families from this conduct. That is our purpose here today. Senator Abraham has shown strong leadership in bringing this legislation forward.

I remember one of the finest education talks I have heard in the Senate was where the good Senator from West Virginia reviewed for the Members of the Senate his personal experience--it was shared by a few others--in terms of the value of education as a young person when he was growing up in the State of West Virginia. As he remembers the debate on the No Child Left Behind Act and the debate we had the year before when we were looking at the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, there was a general recognition in this body that just providing resources without reform was not meeting our responsibility to the children of this country. But if we were going to have reform, we were going to have to have resources. As I remember the discussions we had with the President of the United States on this point, this was a simple concept, but a rather basic concept, one which gathered broad bipartisan support and was the keystone of the whole No Child Left Behind Act. I am wondering if the Senator remembers at least that general debate and discussion in which this body said, OK, we have not been able to use the resources we have used in looking at title I and elementary and secondary as effectively as we would like to, but we are strongly committed toward reforming our educational system because education is so important to the future of our country, and that was a debate that took place, that resulted in No Child Left Behind, and it is to that issue that the Senator from West Virginia is addressing the Senate, as I hear him this afternoon; that we have put in place the reforms but what is not there are the resources to give life to the reforms. This is what is at the heart of the Senator's amendment, as I understand it and as I interpret it. Am I correct?","word.count":356,"sep11":2.04494382022472,"years":2003.90449438202,"days":3170,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0159164589283224,"Topic 2":0.0196849071576482,"Topic 3":0.142303585930342,"Topic 4":0.0785320182727299,"Topic 5":0.0326546272020025,"Topic 6":0.273833908722708,"Topic 7":0.0491189985492901,"Topic 8":0.225837753237982,"Topic 9":0.0110956888627535,"Topic 10":0.151022053136221},{"id":"10619990082755","body":"Mary Landrieu: Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to speak on a subject that is very important to many Members of this body. In fact, Senator DeWine from Ohio has been one of the leading advocates for adoption. Before he leaves the floor, I wanted to acknowledge that. He, along with many Members, including the occupant of the Chair, Senator Voinovich, have been very active in the promotion of laws and policies that would help us to reach our goal of finding a loving and nurturing home for every child in this world that needs one. Many of us believe that it is a fundamental right to grow up in a home with a family, as opposed to in a hospital, or some type of institution. I rise to bring the body up to date on some of the things that we have accomplished and that we should be proud of, as well as some of the challenges that are still before us as a Congress. In the short time ahead, I am hopeful the appropriate committees will have hearings on relevant legislation in order to move the adoption debate along quickly. There are literally millions of children and families depending on us to act. First, let me congratulate Senators Chafee and Rockefeller for leading the successful effort last year to pass the Adoption and Safe Families Act. Last week, President Clinton and Mrs. Clinton hosted the first awards ceremony associated with the passage of that Act. The great news is that we have taken a mighty and important step forward because since the passage of the Act 36,000 American children have been placed in foster care while 15,000 foreign children have found permanent homes--all with wonderful families throughout America. Moreover, at least 35 States were acknowledged for their outstanding work in this area at the White House ceremony last week. In some States, the increases have been 20 percent over last year's numbers, while others have seen 50- to 70-percent increases over the previous year. This has occurred because the law we passed gave the necessary tools to parents, social workers, community activists, and to local elected officials so that the dream of a family became a reality for these 36,000 children. The problem is we still have over 500,000 children waiting for a family to call their own. Through this bill, many of the children in foster care, who range from all ages, races, medical conditions, and backgrounds, will be able to one day return to their biological families. However, despite our best efforts, unfortunate circumstances exist which prevent some of these children from returning home. Consequently these children must be moved to a permanent place. The Adoption and Safe Families Act will provide the tools for us to help these children in terms of guidelines and the necessary resources. Again I want to thank all the members, particularly Senators Rockefeller and Chafee, for their leadership in making this law possible. It is working and we just need to continue our efforts because many children are still waiting for a home to call their own. That leads me to the next three points. We have accomplished some wonderful things. But in this Congress during the next few weeks, some important tasks still remain to be finished. If we fail, there will be several million children left waiting. Next week, under the leadership of the distinguished Senator from North Carolina, Senator Helms, we will be having our first hearing on the Hague Treaty, the International Convention for Adoption. The purpose of the hearing will be to consider the Intercountry Adoption Act, legislation which seeks to implement the objectives of this Treaty. I am an original cosponsor of this measure, along with Senator Helms, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and the Ranking Member, Senator Biden from Delaware. This Treaty is very important because, as we endeavor to ensure that every child in America who needs a home will have one, it is also important for us to realize that there are millions of children around the world--in South America, in Africa, in Latin America, in Eastern and Western Europe, and Asia--who are growing up in horrible conditions. Some of them are in institutions with unspeakable conditions and there are others who are actually living in the streets. With all of our global successes, it is appalling and unacceptable that these conditions exist anywhere in the world. We can do something about it. Today, the Internet will allow us to do more than we ever dreamed possible--connecting families with children, allowing agencies to work more closely together, and, most importantly, allowing for improved communications between governments. The language barriers are coming down as technology opens up greater opportunities. But none of this can work without a body of international law that gives us the rules and regulations for how this is going to take place. We must eliminate the corruption, the outrageous trafficking of children, and the extraordinary fees that are sometimes being paid illegally. So if we are to have protection for children, protection for families, and protection for the legal framework, this Treaty is absolutely essential. I urge my colleagues to pay special attention next week during this hearing, and I urge them to learn more about this issue, because there is something we all can do; that is, to move this piece of legislation forward with the few minor differences that exist between both sides of the aisle, approve the treaty, and then implement it. If my colleagues are like me--and I think many of them are--when we get a few minutes to watch television we can view programs such as Save the Children where there are thousands of children who are in need. I sit there and think about what I could do as one individual sponsoring one child. It does not seem to be enough. But in many instances reaching out to sponsor that one child is quite enough. Millions of Americans have the opportunity to do the same. I am looking forward to the Senate Foreign Service Committee's hearing on adoption next week. I am confident that we can solve the differences that may exist among the interested parties who are working to move this important legislation forward. In addition to the implementation of this international Treaty, we are faced here in the United States with some additional challenges in our adoption laws. One of the things we failed to accomplish, which perhaps may have been an oversight when we passed the Family and Medical Leave Act, was a requirement that employers offer adoptive families the same benefits as birth families. I believe the Family and Medical Leave Act made progress toward equal treatment for adoptive families, but discrepancies remain for adoptive families who seek the same employee benefits as birth families. This law enables both adoptive and birth families to take up to twelve weeks of unpaid, job protected leave. Some employers, however, permit employees to use sick leave or provide paid leave for birth parents, but do not provide these same benefits for adoptive families. As an adoptive parent, I can certainly attest to the fact that whether the child is biological or comes as a gift through adoption, the stress on the families are very much the same. This is why the expansion of the Family and Medical Leave Act is so important. It must include the thousands of families in our country who adopt either domestically or internationally every year. This inclusion will allow Congress to say that building a family through adoption is a blessing for children and parents. This is one important goal I hope we can achieve this Congress. In addition, I hope we can extend the adoption tax credit we passed several years ago, which is now $5,000 based on actual expenses, and double it, making it $10,000. This will make it real and workable, especially for those families who adopt special needs children. Currently, this tax credit is working but it can be improved for those parents who adopt special needs children--older children, handicapped children, children with special emotional challenges, sibling groups, or international adoption. Unless you can demonstrate all expenses in connection with the adoption you are unable to avail yourself of the tax credit. In many ways, when you take a special needs child, there are no expenses associated with the adoption itself because the agencies of course want to place these children. I believe it would be in the best money this Congress could spend to provide tax credits, tax credits to families who adopt hard-to-place children and sibling groups, and others with difficulties. The Government should state that if you will take a child into your home and call it your own, we will give you a $10,000 tax credit. A family who would adopt two children would get a $20,000 Federal tax credit. It is my hope that they would not have to pay Federal taxes for many years because these families are doing something great for their community and country. Mr. President, in closing, let me show you a picture of a beautiful little girl as an example of what I have been talking about. This child is coming from China. Her mother, Cheryl Varnado, wrote me a letter about little Anna Grace Cai Yong Lin. Her letter reads: Senator, would you fly an American flag over the Capitol today so that I can give it to our little girl in remembrance of her first day in the United States? I commend the Government of China for the wonderful work they are doing to provide homes for millions of Chinese children. Today they are doing a much better job in this area. The challenges faced by this country are great. There are over one million children without families who will grow up in institutional care unless someone brings them into their home and provides them with the love of a family. We are happy for Anna and her new family. The flag flying over the Capitol today will remind us of her arrival to the United States and the thousands of other children that have come from all over th","word.count":1795,"sep11":-1.99719101123595,"years":1999.86235955056,"days":1731,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0803873966050611,"Topic 2":0.171542784181102,"Topic 3":0.0143741541590038,"Topic 4":0.383587316839035,"Topic 5":0.00835690753800703,"Topic 6":0.00512814252053618,"Topic 7":0.0180097230326829,"Topic 8":0.109892487899233,"Topic 9":0.164971727057594,"Topic 10":0.0437493601677458},{"id":"10519980077749","body":"Sam Brownback: Mr. President, I want to give a couple of facts and some figures that I think are important to have. The average marriage penalty in this country for people who are paying the marriage penalty is just over $1,400 a year; $1,425 a year is the average amount that families are paying for the marriage penalty in America. I think that is just far too high. It may not seem like a lot to some people. But in paying electric bills, you could pay an average one for over 9 months. For some families, it would pay for a week-long vacation at Disneyland. It would make four payments on a minivan. You can go out to dinner, buy over 1,000 gallons of gasoline, you can buy over 1,200 loaves of bread. Those are important things to do with $1,425. I want to show this chart to my colleagues as well. There are some who suggested last time when we entered into this debate that there is also a marriage bonus, and that if you will do away with the marriage bonus, we will do away with the marriage penalty. I have no problem whatsoever giving a bonus to people who are married. I think that we should honor this institution, and if they want to propose raising taxes on people who are married, they can go ahead and do so. I oppose that. But I want to show who it hits. Again, you are talking about the highest proportion of the marriage penalty going to those families when the higher-earning spouse is making somewhere between $20,000 and $75,000. These are middle-income, a lot of times just starting to be wage-earner families, and it hits two-wage-earner families as well. These are the people that we should be trying to help out the absolute most. I just find it a completely wrongheaded policy, at a time when we are struggling so much in this country with the set of values we are putting forward, to say we are not only going to not help people making between $20,000 and $75,000, or are just starting a family, we are actually going to tax them, we are going to tax them more.","word.count":368,"sep11":-3.20224719101124,"years":1998.65730337079,"days":1302,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0869916322219163,"Topic 2":0.157860150888613,"Topic 3":0.0628134694988058,"Topic 4":0.00699892507312213,"Topic 5":0.0218215137152632,"Topic 6":0.351564578699483,"Topic 7":0.00942639836789411,"Topic 8":0.24206919795194,"Topic 9":0.054053481029977,"Topic 10":0.00640065255298524},{"id":"10720010001110","body":"Jack Quinn: The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Illinois that the House suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution, H.

Mr. Chairman, I strongly oppose this amendment. Many of my colleagues have pointed out in the process that the Economic Stabilization Fund has changed since 1934, and I think that that is true. The world has changed, and the role of the United States today, as the leading economic power in the global marketplace, is very important. I would think that my colleagues would be looking at the global economy and looking at our mixed economy and the free enterprise system and marketplace values that we have advocated, and the success that they are having on a global basis, and have a very great interest in maintaining them. To adopt this amendment would be the military equivalent of a unilateral disarmament. The fact is I understand that many of my colleagues would advocate such a free market situation that we would leave some of the countries that are experiencing these economic downturns and turmoil to proceed to economic ground zero. The fact is that almost anyplace we look at the utilization of the Economic Stabilization Fund, as exercised authority by the Treasury, with the approval of the President and past Presidents and past Secretaries of the Treasury, anyplace we look at that we find a lot of pain, economically, as is the case that has been pointed out with regards to Mexico and the bankruptcy and problems that have occurred. The ESF isn't loaning funds where it isn't needed. But the question that one must ask themselves is what would it have been like if we had let the hand of sort of an Adam Smith level the entire country of Mexico and then start over. I am certain that none of my colleagues are so duty bound to the ideological proposition or theories of a free market that they want to see that type of suffering occur in Mexico. The fact of the matter is we are not just doing this to help the Mexicans or the Korean government, as many of my colleagues talked about the U.S. and IMF intervention since last December, but, in fact, we are doing it to help ourselves that is the U.S.A. too. In other words, this is the evolution in terms of how the U.S.A. intervenes and how to assist a global economy and help our own exchange rates and help other economies that has also evolved since 1934. We have a better understanding of the global economy. And, of course, this Economic Stabilization Fund plays a key role, along with other multinational financial institutions that exist, which, of course, we are debating broadly. And, of course, there is great debate over whether or not the IMF ought to receive the type of funding that has been requested by the President. But this amendment of ESF is not just a new funding. This attempt in this particular amendment is to renege, is to renege on the existing powers and the existing authority and the existing tools that the Secretary of the Treasury and that this President have in terms of trying to deal with a tumultuous economic circumstance that basically surrounds us in four different directions. That is what the effect of this amendment is to deny and frustrate the ability of the U.S.A. to play a vital economic role. And, of course, to portray that we could deal with those particular problems in $250 million increments is, of course, not a serious effort. The fact of the matter is that countries right today, right this week, as we pick up the paper and read about the type of loans and the type of financial structure that had to be dealt with to prevent the default of the entire country of Russia, I would think would bring a little bit to reality; would bring us down to a little bit of terra firma, right down to the ground, to where we can feel and experience what is going on rather than being up here where we would pull the tools away and let the chips fall where they may. Is this a perfect tool? Is the IMF a perfect tool? I think the answer is no. But the gentleman is offering to take this away and to substantially reduce it to the point of being ineffectual and not putting anything in its place. And, of course, I think one can point out that some employees used this for dinners or did other things that this money was not to be used for, but we get monthly reports on this now. There has been an accounting and is an accounting that needs to be the subject of our oversight committees. But to pull this ESF down is to, in fact, set a course for an economic spiral, a downturn, that would greatly hurt this Nation. So the gentleman's amendment is not offering improvement, it is offering pulling the plug out. Stop the world, I want to get off. I want to stop this U.S. economy. We have to accept more responsibility than that, and we ought to exercise good judgment by resisting and soundly defeating this amendment. This amendment deserves to be defeated. We should not let them unilaterally disarm our economic capacity. We ought to leave those tools in place. We ought to be debating the IMF and trying to improve on what the programs do and how they operate. Yes, there is a lot of pain where the IMF is involved or where the economic stabilization fund is involved, but not because of it. These programs are the solutions to the economic difficulties, not the problem.","word.count":954,"sep11":-3.23876404494382,"years":1998.62078651685,"days":1289,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.431148685551881,"Topic 2":0.215858899432015,"Topic 3":0.0172372704703534,"Topic 4":0.0884598833011567,"Topic 5":0.219747653537403,"Topic 6":0.00475112332511169,"Topic 7":0.00359464980218738,"Topic 8":0.00961326975509384,"Topic 9":0.00406827252723687,"Topic 10":0.00552029229756087},{"id":"10419960032986","body":"Sheila Jackson-Lee: Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his leadership.

Since the 1930's the Home Loan Bank System has provided the nation's savings institutions with advances that can be used to make home mortgages. In 1989, the System was opened up to banks and credit unions. The Home Loan Bank System is critical for homeownership in the U.S. The Bank System has nearly 7,000 members and has outstanding nearly $181 billion in housing advances. The membership of the system is reserved for insured institutions. My legislation, however, would permit Community Development Financial Institutions to have ``non-member'' borrowing status. This would allow approximately 200 CDFIs to borrow from the System, with the approval of their regional Home Loan Bank and on the same terms as all other members. Mr. President, this is a small, but important step toward creating more homeownership opportunities, particularly for low income individuals. CDFIs were created for the purpose of reaching out to provide housing and economic opportunity in distressed areas. My home state of North Carolina is home to more CDFIs than any other state in the United States, except for California, New York and Illinois. North Carolina has been a leader in finding new and different ways to foster economic growth and home ownership. Very simply, this legislation will allow CDFIs to have a source of credit to make home loans. These loans will have to meet the normal collateral requirements of any other institution that belongs to the Home Loan Bank System. Because CDFIs are chartered to target distressed communities, however, this could be an important source of credit for homeownership that might not otherwise exist. We know from experience that once an individual has a home--he or she has a stake in the community. This can help turn distressed communities into thriving communities. We have made great progress in the last few years. Welfare rolls are at their lowest point since 1969. Homeownership is at its highest level ever. We are no longer running our federal budgets in the red. Now we can begin to take new and creative steps to continue promoting economic growth and opportunity.

For the public, this bill helps assure that our schools get results and that we know what those results are. California's public schools should be helped by this bill. To bolster student achievement, this bill includes several needed reforms, tying the receipt of Federal funds to getting results: The bill continues the current requirement that States must have academic standards for reading and math and adds a requirement that States establish standards for science. Schools must assure that students make continuous and substantial academic improvement and that students reach a proficient level within 12 years. To measure student achievement, States are required to test every student in grades 3-8 annually in reading and math based on State standards, by 2005-06. To ensure accountability, schools that fail for 2 consecutive years to make adequate yearly progress must be identified for improvement and also must identify specific steps to improve student performance. After 3 years, a failing school must offer public school choice and provide supplemental services. After 4 years, a school must take corrective actions such as replacing staff or implementing a new curriculum. After 5 years, a failing school must undertake major restructuring. The bill provides $500 million to help turn around low- performing schools. In order to improve teacher quality, this bill authorizes grants to States for teacher certification, recruitment, and retention services. States must assure that all teachers are qualified by 2006. The bill authorizes $1.25 billion in 2002 and up to $2.5 billion in 2007 for afterschool programs remedial education, tutoring and other services to improve student achievement. The bill requires public ``report cards,'' which will report on academic achievement, graduation rates and the names of failing schools. There are many other important initiatives and reforms. Another important feature of this bill is that it better directs Federal funds to disadvantaged students than does current law. Here are some examples: It requires that for the largest Federal education program, Title I, Aid to the Disadvantaged, the poor children count be updated every year instead of every 2 years under current law. This is very important to California, a State that has a higher than average poverty rate and high growth in the number of low-income children. The bill requires that more funds be funneled to States and districts using the targeted grant formula, which is focused on concentrations of poverty, areas such as Los Angeles, San Diego and other major cities. California is expected to receive a larger share of targeted grant funding than under current law because of its concentrated child poverty enrollment. The bill shifts bilingual and immigrant education funding from a competitive grant program to a formula grant program based on the number of children. California has a very high proportion of limited- English proficient and newly-immigrant children and should be greatly helped by this change. These are welcomed changes and should send the resources to where the needs are. The Federal Government provides only 7 percent of total education funding, but the strength of this bill is that it tries to leverage the Federal share to prod States and school districts to make schools responsible for real results. I believe the bill offers hope and resources to California's students, school officials, parents, and the public. California's schools are facing huge challenges. California has a projected enrollment rate triple that of the national rate. Unfortunately, many California students perform poorly compared to students in many other States. California has some of the largest classes in the Nation. California has overcrowded and substandard facilities and 30,000 uncredentialed teachers. I am sorry to say that 34 percent of California's schools that participate in Title I are identified for improvement compared to the national average of 19 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Education. According to the January 2001 Education Weekly Quarterly Report, only 20 percent of California's fourth grade students are proficient in reading, ranking 36 out of 39 States. California ranks 32 out of 36 States for proficient eighth graders in reading, at 22 percent. American students are falling behind their counterparts in other countries. In literacy, 58 percent of U.S. high school graduates rank below an international literacy standard, dead last among the 29 countries that participated, according to Education Week, April 4, 2001. United States eighth graders scored significantly lower in mathematics and science than their peers in 14 of the 38 participating countries, according to the 1999 TIMMS Benchmarking Study. The percentage of teachers in the United States that feel they are ``very well prepared'' to teach science in the classroom is 27 percent. The international average is twice that, peaking at 56 percent, according to the 1999 TIMMS Benchmarking Study. United States students' knowledge of civic activities ranked 3rd out of the 28 countries that participated. However, those same students have been slipping in scores relating to math and science, according to Civic Know-How: US Students Rise to Test, International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement. The final bill includes several initiatives that I suggested: As to Title I funding, I have long argued that Title I should reflect the real numbers of poor students. This bill retains the requirement that the poor child count be updated every two years. Also, the bill better targets funds on concentrations of poor children, which should particularly help our urban school districts, like Los Angeles. As to master teachers, the bill allows funds under the teacher training title to create ``exemplary'' or ``master'' teachers who could mentor and guide less-experienced teachers, in an effort to keep new teachers in teaching. This is an outgrowth of my bill, S. 120. As to the Title I audit, the bill requires the Inspector General to conduct of audit to determine how Title I funds are used and the degree to which they are used for academic instruction. The Senate had accepted my amendment to better direct Title I funds to academic activities and away from things like playground supervisors. While the limitations of my amendment are not included in the final bill, the required audit will help us determine specifically whether Title I funds are being used to help students learn. As to small schools, the bill allows the use of Innovative Education funds to create smaller learning environments. While the final bill does not include my amendment that puts in place certain school-size requirements, as a condition for receiving funds, it does move that direction and recognize that smaller schools produce more learning. As to gun-free schools clarification, the bill includes several clarifications of the current Gun-Free Schools Act, the 1994 law which requires a 1-year expulsion for students who ``bring'' a gun to school. This bill includes students who ``possess'' a gun at school; it clarifies that the term ``school'' means the entire school campus, any setting under the control and supervision of the local school district; and it requires that all modifications of expulsions be put in writing. These are important clarifications to the law, the need for which was highlighted by an Inspector General's report on the implementation of that law. This bill makes some of the most profound revisions to Federal education policy since ESEA was first enacted in 1965. It is an important reform designed to help students learn, achieve and in fact, excel. The bill authorizes significant new funding. For example, Title I's authorized funding would grow from $13.5 billion in fiscal year 2002 to $25 billion in 2007. Now the challenge is to in fact provide those funds so that this bill will not be an empty promise.","word.count":1293,"sep11":0.275280898876405,"years":2002.13483146067,"days":2540,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.029173415036569,"Topic 2":0.218350374697188,"Topic 3":0.00500749183056085,"Topic 4":0.0025520964465782,"Topic 5":0.063623496253646,"Topic 6":0.00669755585945136,"Topic 7":0.662676892194487,"Topic 8":0.00425524058461468,"Topic 9":0.0063453553906289,"Topic 10":0.00131808170627614},{"id":"10419950112849","body":"Bob Dole: Finally, Mr. President, let me say with reference to the gift ban, [[Page S 10597]] that has been debated this morning.

I do not know of anybody here that will live or die based on what happens on the gift ban. I think what we want to make certain of is that you do not have someone in this body who gets in trouble for some unintentional act. I received five birthday cakes last week. I am not certain what the value of the cakes were. I only ate one piece. But I might be in trouble because I am certain that the value of some of those cakes was in excess of $20. I was in Ocala, FL, on Sunday. They gave me a very nice piece of artistic work from wood. I do not know the value of it. The artist is not well known but well known in that part of Florida. Are we to say we cannot take that? There was not any lobbying group there. There were about 400 people there. For some reason they were happy I was there, and they gave me this gift. I believe that the thing we want to make certain of is that we do not go over the cliff here. I know there are 23 exemptions, as I understand it, for ``nonlobbyists.'' But I would hope my friend from Kentucky, who is present on the floor, would make certain, in our effort to make certain we are all simon pure, that we do not unintentionally involve one of our colleagues in some difficulty down the road if somebody in an election year, particularly if somebody did not register this birthday cake, they did not register this or that. I think it is easy to go to the extreme. If you do not have any friends they do not give you any gifts, and you do not have any problem. But most of us have friends, and they are good people. They are people from our home State, and people from other States which we visit. I am talking about minimal gifts, not anything of any great substance. If we can work out a bipartisan agreement, then obviously we will take it up tomorrow. If not, we may delay it for a while because we want to start on the State Department authorization bill. Hopefully, we can finish that in 2 or 3 days.

We have 12 million undocumented immigrants; we don't know where they are or what risks they face. We cannot deport them all. We have a porous border.

So when we vote to confirm a justice for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court, we have an awesome responsibility to get it right. And when we vote to confirm the Chief Justice of the United States, we have an even greater responsibility, because the stakes are even higher. The Chief Justice sets the tone for the Court and, through leadership, influences Court decisions in ways both subtle and direct. Indeed, during the course of his confirmation hearings, Judge Roberts expressly acknowledged the important role that a Chief Justice can play in persuading his fellow justices to come along to his way of thinking about a particular case. During my discussion with him of the Supreme Court's landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education, I mentioned that the decision was a unanimous one. Judge Roberts responded: On another day, when I again mentioned Brown and the indispensable role played by Chief Justice Warren, Judge Roberts said: I have thought long and hard about the exchanges I had with Judge Roberts, and I have read and re-read the transcript and the record. And try as I might, I cannot find the evidence to conclude that John Roberts understands the real world impact of court decisions on civil rights and equal rights in this country. And I cannot find the evidence to conclude that a Chief Justice John Roberts would be the kind of inspirational leader who would use his powers of persuasion to bring all the Court along on America's continued march toward progress. Therefore, I do not believe that John Roberts has met the burden of proof necessary to be confirmed by the Senate as Chief Justice of the United States. Sadly, there is ample evidence in John Roberts' record to indicate that he would turn the clock back on this country's great march of progress toward equal opportunity for all. The White House has refused to release documents and information from his years in the Reagan administration and in the first Bush administration that might indicate otherwise, but without those records we have no way of knowing. Both in committee and on the floor, some have argued that those of us who oppose John Roberts' nomination are trying to force a nominee to adopt our ``partisan'' positions, to support our ``causes,'' to yield to our ``special interest'' agendas. But progress toward a freer, fairer Nation where ``justice for all'' is a reality--not just a pledge in the Constitution--is not a personal ``cause'' or a ``special interest'' or a ``partisan'' philosophy or ideology or agenda. For more than half a century, our Nation's progress toward a just society has been a shared goal of both Democrats and Republicans. Since Republican Senate Leader Everett Dirksen led his party in supporting the Civil Rights Act of 1964, equal rights for all has been a consensus cause, not a ``partisan cause.'' Since Congress adopted the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and began the process of spreading true democracy to all Americans, it has been a national goal, not a ``special interest'' goal. Fulfilling the Founders' ideals of equality and justice for all is not just a personal ideology, it is America's ideology. Surely, in the 21st century, anyone who leaves the slightest doubt as to whether he shares it fully, openly and enthusiastically should not be confirmed to any office, let alone the highest judicial office in the land. Our doubts about John Roberts' commitment to continuing our national progress toward justice was, quite appropriately, a major issue in the committee hearings. The fundamental question was whether his record and his answers suggested that he would be an obstacle to that progress, by treating cases before the Supreme Court in a narrow legalistic way that resists and undermines the extraordinary gains of the past. For all his brilliance and polish, he gave us insufficient evidence to demonstrate that the John Roberts of today is not the ideological activist he clearly was before. The strong evidence from his own hand and mind, the crucial 3-year gap in evidence because of the Administration's refusal to release his papers as Deputy Solicitor General, and his grudging and ambiguous answers at the hearing left too many fundamental doubts, and could put the entire Nation at risk for decades to come. Some argue that John Roberts was just doing his job and carrying out the policies of the Reagan administration in the early 1980s. But his own writings refute that argument--these were clearly his own views, and were enthusiastically offered as his views. If he didn't agree with those policies as a lawyer in the Justice Department in 1981 and 1982, he would not have applied for the more political and more sensitive job in the White House Counsel's office when he left the Justice Department. He knowingly chose to be a voice for their policies, and often advocated even more extreme versions of those policies. He certainly knew what was expected of him when he chose to become Deputy Solicitor General in 1989. That position was explicitly created to be the political monitor over all Department of Justice litigation. He was eager to advance the ideological views that his earlier memoranda show he personally supported. He obviously wasn't just ``following orders''--he was an eager recruit for those causes. That was the evidence he needed to overcome in the hearings, and his effort to do so is unconvincing. I hope I am proven wrong about John Roberts. I have been proven wrong before on my confirmation votes. I regret my vote to confirm Justice Scalia even though he, too, like John Roberts, was a nice person and a very smart Harvard lawyer. I regret my vote against Justice Souter, although at the time, his record did not persuade me he was in tune with the Nation's goals and progress. But as the example of Justice Scalia shows, and contrary to the assertions of my colleagues across the aisle, I have never hesitated to vote for a Republican President's nominee to the Supreme Court whose commitment to core national goals and values appeared clear at the time. In fact, I have voted for seven of them, more than the number of nominees of Democratic Presidents I have voted for. Our Senate responsibility to provide advice and consent on the Supreme Court Justices and other nominations is one of our most important functions. The future and the quality of life in this Nation may literally depend on how we exercise it. If we are merely a rubberstamp for the President's nominees, if we put party over principle, then we have failed in this vital responsibility. Even more important, if we go along to get along with the White House, we will be undermining the trust the Founders placed in us, and we will diminish the great institution entrusted to our care. Every thoughtful and reasonable ``no'' vote is a vote for the balance of powers and for the Constitution, so we must never hesitate to cast it when our independent consciences tell us to do so. I yield the floor. The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Today, Senator Bob Graham and I are introducing the Domestic Partner Health Benefits Equity Act, a bill that seeks to simplify the tax code and address the growing trend among both public and private employers who have decided to provide domestic partner benefits to their employees. More than one-third of Fortune 500 companies, as well as numerous State and local governments, are providing health insurance benefits to the domestic partners of their employees. This is a clear trend in the American workplace. However, Federal tax law has not kept pace with corporate changes in this area and employers who offer such benefits and the employees who receive them are taxed inequitably. Our legislation would provide consistent tax treatment for employer- provided health insurance for domestic partners. Currently, the tax code provides that the employer's contribution of the premium for health insurance for an employee's spouse is excluded from the employee's taxable income. An employer's contribution for the domestic partner's coverage, however, is included in an employee's taxable income as a fringe benefit. In addition, the employer's payroll tax liability is increased. This forces businesses to create a two- track payroll system for benefits provided to spouses and those provided to domestic partners, an administrative burden that this legislation would eliminate. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we will increase the number of Americans covered by health insurance by providing employers with a tax incentive. The tax code should not penalize employers for offering these benefits to their employees. I urge my colleagues to join me and support the Domestic Partner Health Benefits Equity Act. I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: ``For taxable years beginning in calendarThe applicable percentage is-- 2005, 2006, or 2007...........................................25 .... 2008, 2009, 2010...........................................50.''..... ``For taxable years beginning in calendarThe applicable percentage is-- 2005, 2006, or 2007...........................................25 .... 2008, 2009, 2010...........................................50.''..... ``For taxable years beginning in calendarThe applicable percentage is-- 2005, 2006, or 2007...........................................25 .... 2008, 2009, 2010...........................................50.''..... ``For taxable years beginning in calendarThe applicable percentage is-- 2005, 2006, or 2007...........................................25 .... 2008, 2009, 2010...........................................50.''..... ``For taxable years beginning in calendarThe applicable percentage is-- 2005, 2006, or 2007...........................................25 .... 2008, 2009, 2010...........................................50.''..... ``For taxable years beginning in calendarThe applicable percentage is-- 2005, 2006, or 2007...........................................25 .... 2008, 2009, 2010...........................................50.''..... ``For taxable years beginning in calendarThe applicable percentage is-- 2005, 2006, or 2007...........................................25 .... 2008, 2009, 2010...........................................50.''..... ``For taxable years beginning in calendarThe applicable percentage is-- 2005, 2006, or 2007...........................................25 .... 2008, 2009, 2010...........................................50.''..... ``For taxable years beginning in calendarThe applicable percentage is-- 2005, 2006, or 2007...........................................25 .... 2008, 2009, 2010...........................................50.''.....","word.count":474,"sep11":2.10955056179775,"years":2003.9691011236,"days":3193,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0299418607367963,"Topic 2":0.280310198347813,"Topic 3":0.00661104192355831,"Topic 4":0.253266857622015,"Topic 5":0.00791835645996349,"Topic 6":0.00632199649493765,"Topic 7":0.00971307181500301,"Topic 8":0.166798036409365,"Topic 9":0.229807542066183,"Topic 10":0.00931103812436569},{"id":"10519980081003","body":"Robert Byrd: Mr. President, we appear to be only days away from receiving the Independent Counsel's report on President Clinton. The pressure on Congress is escalating. Talk of impeachment is in the air along with suggestions of resolutions of reprimand and censure. Some have even suggested that we ought to get on with impeachment and ``get this thing behind us.'' There had to come a time, sooner or later, when the boil would be lanced. The problem is, that with the lancing, a hemorrhaging may be only one of those continuing symptoms of a greater lancing--perhaps even an amputation--that still lurks in the shadows up ahead. There is no question but that the President, himself, has sown the wind, and he is reaping the whirlwind. His televised speech of August 17 heaped hot coals upon himself, coals causing wounds which continue to inflame and burn ever more deeply. Coming, as the speech did, so soon after the President's appearance before the Grand Jury, his words were ill-timed, ill-formed, and ill-advised. Perhaps if he had only delayed his televised speech for 24 hours, he may have, upon reflection, avoided some self-inflicted wounds that have since festered and continue to fester. When the scribes and Pharisees brought before Jesus a woman taken in adultery, saying that, under Moses, the law commanded that she be stoned, they sought to tempt Jesus that they might accuse him. He said unto them: ``He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.'' And that ancient admonition, that he who is without sin should cast the first stone, applies to every human being in this country today. Someone else has said: ``No man's life will bear looking into.'' These admonishments should give all of us pause and should encourage reflection and self-examination. In this instance, the President, himself, has, by his own actions and words, thrown the first stone at himself and thus made himself vulnerable to the stoning by others. What a sorrowful spectacle! To maintain that Presidents have private lives is, of course, not to be denied, but the Oval Office of the White House is not a private office; it is where much of the business of the Nation is conducted daily; it is the people's office; and the only real privacy that any President can realistically claim is in the third- floor living quarters of the White House with his family. What the President had hoped to claim was ``nobody else's business'' has now become everybody else's business. His speech was a lawyer-worded effort--as in the reference to ``legally accurate'' testimony--and the people have long since grown tired of having to pick and sift among artfully crafted words that have too often obscured the truth rather than revealed it. The White House's apparent strategy of delay and attack over so many long months has only succeeded in stringing out a judgment day that is increasingly threatening, and has only made bad matters worse. Former President Nixon, in an earlier tragedy for the Nation and for all of us who were here and lived through it, tried the same thing--delay, delay, delay, and counter-attack, attack, attack--and it failed in the end. We seem to be living recent history all over again. As the Book of Ecclesiastes plainly tells us, ``There is no new thing under the sun.'' Time seems to be turning backward in its flight, and many of the mistakes that President Nixon made are being made all over again. We also must stop and remember that this is a sad time for the President and his family, a sad time for his friends and supporters throughout the country, a sad time for the devoted members of his staff who have labored and sacrificed and given so much for a man in whom they implicitly believed. It is a sad time for members of his cabinet and heads of agencies who publicly defended him and who depended on his word. But it is an even sadder time for the country. As a schoolboy, I looked upon George Washington and Thomas Jefferson and James Madison and Abraham Lincoln as my idols to be emulated; I looked upon Babe Ruth and Jack Dempsey and Charles Lindbergh and Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Edison and Nathan Hale and Daniel Morgan and Nathaniel Green and Stonewall Jackson as my heroes. I was taught, as most of us were, to revere God. I was taught to believe the Bible, and that a judgment day would surely come when we would all be punished for our sins or be saved by our faith and good works. The old couple who raised me taught me by their example and their words not to lie but to tell the truth, not to cheat but to be honest; but what will parents tell their children today? Can they tell them to plow a straight furrow and that honesty is still the best policy? To whom can our young people look for inspiration? I recently asked a question on this floor, ``Where have all the heroes gone?'' I ask that question again today. Where have all the heroes gone? Fortunately, we do have a Mark McGwire and a Sammy Sosa, both of whom have captured the Nation's admiration with their home runs. But where are the Nation's leaders to whom the children can look and be inspired to work hard and live clean lives? The political and social environment in which parents must today raise their children is, unfortunately, an environment in which anything goes; politicians try to be all things to all people; family values and religious values which made us a great Nation are looked upon as old-fashioned, unsophisticated, and the product of ignorance and rusticness. Profanity and vulgarity, sex and violence are pervasive in television programming, in the movies, and in much of today's books that pretend to pass for literature. The Nation is inexorably sinking toward the lowest common denominator in its standards and values. Haven't we had enough? Yes, talk of impeachment and censure and resignation is in the air. It is on almost everybody's mind with whom I have talked. As we find ourselves being brought nearer and nearer, as it would seem, to a yawning abyss, I urge that we all step back and give ourselves and the country a little pause in which to reflect and meditate before we cast ourselves headlong over the precipice. To say we ought to get on with impeachment and ``get the thing behind us'' is a bold thing to say; but boldness, to the point of cavalierness, can come back to haunt us. I suggest that we Senators should let the House do its work and wait to see what action that body takes. The Senate cannot vote on Articles of Impeachment--we all know that--until the House formulates such articles and presents them by its managers to the Senate--if it ever does so. I also suggest that putting ``this thing behind us'' is not going to be an easy thing to do. If Congress reaches that stage of voting on Articles of Impeachment it is going to be a traumatic experience for all of us, both here in this city and throughout the country. The House is in no position to formulate Articles of Impeachment prior to its receipt and consideration of--and I emphasize consideration--the Starr report. The Judiciary Committee--I am talking about the Judiciary Committee in the House--will undoubtedly want to hold hearings before it formulates any Articles of Impeachment if such appear to be called for. That is the House's charge; that is the House's responsibility, not ours. If and when such Articles are presented here to the Senate--they are not amendable here, and the Senate, in such cases, is limited to an up-or-down vote on each Article--that will be a matter of the utmost gravity. All Senators will be sworn. I tell you. That will be a matter of the utmost gravity. Caution should be the order of the day. If, sometime in the future, the American people should come to believe that this President, or any other President, has been driven out of office for what they may perceive to be political reasons, their wrath will fall upon those who jumped to judgment prematurely. That is not something that we can so easily ``put behind us.'' Both the media and those of us who may ultimately be called upon to sit in judgment should exercise restraint in pressing toward a particular conclusion before all of the facts are known. There is a constitutional process in place. We should all let it work. It is my suggestion that everyone should exercise some self-restraint against calling for impeachment or censure or for the President's resignation. Who knows? I may do that before it is all over. But not now. We should exercise some self-restraint against calling for impeachment, or censure, or for resignation--until the other body has had an opportunity to study and sift through the Starr report. There are many avenues down which we could travel as we grapple with this matter. Among them is the path of official censure which some have suggested. Others may think that censure is ``meaningless.'' Let me state for the record that that is not my view. I have written in my work on the Senate that censure has no constitutional basis. It doesn't mean that censure is unconstitutional. Just as ``holds'' that are placed on bills and resolutions have no basis in the Senate rules, they nevertheless have grown up as a custom here, and such ``holds'' are practiced. I have observed that censure is not mentioned in the Constitution. But, certainly censure is not ``meaningless.'' It is a serious and emphatic expression of condemnation and disapproval. Censure by the Congress is a major blot on the record and reputation of a public official. While at this point, I prefer to reserve judgment on that course, it should not be simply brushed off as ``meaningless.'' And we must not fail to consider the lessons of history. For my part, I have seen history repeat itself. I served on the Senate Judiciary Committee and was the Democratic Whip during the weeks and months of the Nixon tragedy. Some of the aspects of that tragedy can be seen in the problems that are today confronting us. Some aspects are different. Much is the same.

Madam Speaker, just 2 weeks ago the President signed into law the most comprehensive rewrite of this Nation's campaign finance laws in a generation. It is an enormous step towards cleaner elections and a better democracy. The ink on this new law is barely dry, and we are already debating a proposal to add back the loopholes. The Taxpayer Bill of Rights bill is a good bill, but it includes several provisions that will torpedo key disclosure requirements for so-called stealth PACs. These disclosure requirements were put in place by a law that this Congress passed 2 years ago to shine sunlight on organizations influencing Federal elections without disclosing a dime of their expenditures or contributions. This bill would exempt State and local PACs from Federal disclosure requirements even where there is not adequate disclosure at the State level. What does that mean? How do we know that States are going to require disclosure of every single contribution. We cannot have guarantees; that is why we needed a stealth PAC legislation. There are so-called sham issue ads that disguise themselves as real issue ads. They influence Federal elections. This bill is a loophole, the beginning of what many of us are afraid will be a series of loopholes designed to undermine campaign finance reform that this Congress passed and the President of the United States signed. This bill would permit State and local PACs for which Federal office holders raise soft money, Federal office holders raising soft money to qualify for this exemption from Federal filing requirements. That is why this provision should not be in this bill. All Members should be proud of what we have accomplished on campaign finance reform. It was a historic effort by both sides of the aisle to pass meaningful disclosure requirements, to rein in sham issue ads, and to bring some accountability back to our Federal campaign finance system, or any ads meant to influence a Federal election. We should not be taking steps backwards after taking major steps forward. Let us work together, as our colleagues on the other body have said, and they have had a dialogue about this in a bipartisan, responsible way to fix the 527 law. The gentleman from Texas has been on this issue for some time. In fact, the gentleman warned many of us 2 years ago when we were debating this legislation that there might be a loophole. Let us do this the right way and not undermine the wonderful work that this Congress has done on campaign finance reform.","word.count":478,"sep11":0.589887640449438,"years":2002.44943820225,"days":2652,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0160622016641336,"Topic 2":0.155890609444769,"Topic 3":0.00699451301021072,"Topic 4":0.00793395426661114,"Topic 5":0.0110163828299627,"Topic 6":0.0057018600947899,"Topic 7":0.0119024197912794,"Topic 8":0.0638224544309668,"Topic 9":0.679014383513869,"Topic 10":0.0416612209534074},{"id":"10820040062451","body":"Ben Nelson: Mr. President, I support our amendment to provide emergency drought disaster assistance for farmers and ranchers who have suffered under a prolonged--in some areas a 5 year--drought. I am pleased to be working with Senators Conrad, Baucus, Dorgan, Burns, Roberts and Brownback to offer this amendment. It is a bipartisan amendment, with strong support. This amendment has the strong support of our national farm organizations, such as the American Farm Bureau Federation and the National Farmers Union. Nebraska's facing its fifth straight year of record drought, which as you know has a damaging effect on the agriculture industry, as well as the main street of every Nebraska community. The same is true in Montana, North Dakota, Kansas and other States as well. Droughts, hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes, are natural disasters and deserve to be treated the same. Multiple years of drought have cost our Nation billions of dollars in economic losses and have many farmers wondering whether they'll be able to carry on. We were successful in 2003 in getting assistance to our producers, but only at half the amount necessary. We passed a $3.1 billion assistance package that was offset with farm bill programs--a plan I opposed. I offered a $6 billion emergency assistance package that if it had passed; we probably wouldn't be here today seeking what we were denied in 2003. I have continuously worked for the additional assistance we have been unable to secure. I have repeatedly called on the President and Congress to support funding for drought aid for our farmers and ranchers, and to fully fund the crop and livestock disaster programs so critical to Nebraska's farmers and ranchers. This is of the utmost importance to farmers and ranchers in Nebraska and across all the areas suffering from this natural disaster. The estimated cost for this disaster assistance is $2.9 billion. The assistance will be provided through emergency assistance in the form of a Corp Disaster Program, Quality Loss Program and a Livestock Assistance Program. This assistance is targeted to those who need it most. It will help recover eligible losses sustained by producers in counties designated as primary or continuous disaster areas during the 2003 or 2004 production years. Producers can choose to claim losses for either the 2003 or 2004 production years, but not both years. This flexibility will allow for ranchers and producers to seek assistance for the year with the greatest negative impact on their farm operation. I am happy to report that a similar effort is underway in the House of Representatives. Nebraska's own Tom Osborne is leading a bipartisan effort to secure relief for agriculture producers. I am hopeful that my Senate colleagues will join me in supporting this amendment. We must respond to the crisis this drought has caused in Nebraska and our Midwestern neighbors.","word.count":468,"sep11":3.08707865168539,"years":2004.94662921348,"days":3541,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.746514949327888,"Topic 2":0.0844070894213396,"Topic 3":0.0183637780457605,"Topic 4":0.0390154274246368,"Topic 5":0.0187238754093806,"Topic 6":0.0175150798849644,"Topic 7":0.0146157205104219,"Topic 8":0.0319025652509988,"Topic 9":0.0203689196321107,"Topic 10":0.00857259509249873},{"id":"11020070015034","body":"John Campbell: Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume I stand in support of H.R. 5787, the Federal Real Property Disposal Enhancement Act, which is a sensible, bipartisan effort to address some of the problems with the current Federal property disposal process. There are three key provisions in this bill. The first allows the General Services Administration to help pay the cost of other agencies' disposal activities. In particular, GSA will be able to help agencies pay costs with regard to properties that have yet to be declared excess. These costs include environmental cleanup, demolition, surveying, and life cycle costing. Another key provision modifies existing law to make clear that when a property has been transferred to a nonprofit organization or a State or local government for a public purpose and that public purpose is no longer being met, the property must revert to the Federal Government, which must dispose of it. The final major provision allows all agencies to retain the proceeds from the sale of Federal surplus properties. These proceeds will be used for disposal activities such as developing and implementing a plan to identify and declare properties excess, appraisals, utilization studies, and life cycle planning. The Office of Management and Budget has stated that allowing agencies to retain the proceeds will provide agencies with the funds necessary to cover upfront costs associated with disposals. This bill does not waive any existing law regarding the screening process and therefore does not affect the access of homeless providers or State and local communities to these properties.

She has been on this floor every day and in private meetings every single day, exhorting this Senate, both Democrats and Republicans, not to forget what happened to her home State. It is a tragedy that none of us would like to see befall our own States, and we owe it to her to work with the President, on a bipartisan basis, first, to help the evacuees and victims; second, to make sure the great city of New Orleans is back and running as quickly as possible; third, to make the changes that are necessary to give them peace of mind and security for generations to come. I have listened to her time and again come to the floor and talk about health care and education, the basics that people need to survive. I worry, as I am sure she does, that we are going through Katrina fatigue, that we have heard it for so long we want to turn the page and talk about other things. Thank you for reminding us every single day we cannot turn that page. I have met with those victims. Some have come to Illinois. I tell you but for the generosity and compassion of churches, charities, and local community groups, I do not know how some of these families would have survived. What has happened in farflung communities in Illinois is that these evacuees have been embraced--and thank goodness that happened because otherwise they tell me they wouldn't have known where to turn. When the Government should have been there, it was not there. Sadly, we have to step back now and take an honest evaluation of why that happened. I know the Senator from Louisiana shares my belief that if we had an independent, nonpartisan commission--which we have been begging for for weeks now--to take a look at what happened, not so much that we can figure out who to blame but so that we make sure we never do it again. We hear complaints about FEMA--a few weeks ago in Florida and complaints in Texas. We can do better. When it comes to disasters facing America, natural and otherwise, we can do better. I think we need to come together in an independent, nonpartisan way to make that happen. It is almost hard to believe, and impossible to explain, what is going on in Washington today as we honor and fete Ahmed Chalabi. Who is Ahmed Chalabi? He enjoys the rank of Deputy Prime Minister in the nation of Iraq. But he enjoys a very questionable reputation otherwise. Ahmed Chalabi, it turns out, was one of the key advisers to the Bush administration before the invasion of Iraq. He was so important to the Bush administration that they paid his organization, through the Defense Intelligence Agency, $335,000 a month to sustain his life and his office. Overall, the Bush White House gave his Iraqi National Congress $39 million over the last 5 years, $39 million to this Ahmed Chalabi. Ahmed Chalabi is an expatriate from Iraq, now returned with Saddam Hussein being removed from power, and he has been bankrolled by our Government as long as President Bush has been in office. His Iraqi National Congress was a major source of misinformation and disinformation about the situation in Iraq before our invasion. He was the one who was producing the evidence that led the administration to tell the American people there were weapons of mass destruction. There were people who were skeptical of Ahmed Chalabi from the start. Former Secretary of State Colin Powell said, on June 12, 2003, ``I can't substantiate Chalabi's claims. He makes new ones every year.'' This skepticism was shared by other agencies of our Government, but it did not stop the leaders of our Government, under President Bush, from bringing Ahmed Chalabi into the highest level meetings concerning America's national security and our policies in Iraq. On September 18, 2001, Richard Perle convened a 2-day meeting of the Defense Policy Board, a group that advises the Pentagon. Chalabi, who was a guest speaker at this meeting, made a presentation on the threat from Iraq. It turns out that Chalabi was producing information from so-called defectors on a regular basis to the highest levels of the Bush administration--most of which turned out to be false. That statement was made by State Department intelligence expert Greg Thielmann in the New Yorker. He went on to say: Ahmed Chalabi was the source of this so-called intelligence garbage about the situation in Iraq. And then there was the notorious source named ``Curve Ball.'' He should have been given that name because his information turned out to be so wrong, so bad, and so misleading. He was another one of the so-called defectors who provided this information. He was a discredited INC defector to Germany, code named ``Curve Ball,'' and the chief source of information on Iraq's supposed fleet of mobile germ weapons factories which turned out to be a hoax. ``Curve Ball'' was the brother of a top lieutenant to Ahmad Chalabi. Chalabi did not stop with reaching the highest levels of our Government and misleading them about the situation in Iraq. He had his friends in the media. Chalabi was the source of discredited news stories about Iraq, penned by New York Times reporter Judith Miller. In 2001, Miller wrote a front-page story about claims that Saddam had 20 secret WMD sites hidden in Iraq. It is amazing, the exclusive story came ``just three days after the source had shown deception in a polygraph test administered by the CIA at the request of the Defense Intelligence Agency.'' So when they confronted Ahmad Chalabi and asked, how could you mislead the United States with all of this bad information, leading to our invasion of Iraq, 160,000 American soldiers risking their lives, over 2,000 killed, he said ``we are heroes in error.'' He boasted to the international media that even if he had misled the United States, he had achieved his goal. He got the United States to invade Iraq and depose Saddam Hussein. And then what happened? The tables turned on Mr. Ahmad Chalabi last year. In May of last year, the Iraqi officials, with the cooperation of the United States, raided Ahmad Chalabi's offices in Iraq. Why? I will tell you. In June 2004 Chalabi came under investigation for allegations that he passed secret intelligence data to Iran. Remember Iran, one of the axes of evil? Chalabi is accused of telling the Iranian Government that the United States had broken the code it used for secret communications. National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice promised Congress a full investigation into these allegations. The Wall Street Journal reports: If he did this, it is clear he endangered the lives of our troops, he endangered America's national security. Just this week, the Wall Street Journal came out with a story about Ahmad Chalabi. They went to the FBI and said some 18 months later, what is the status of Ahmad Chalabi? Let me quote FBI spokesman John Miller, who strongly denied that the Chalabi investigation is languished. He said: He added: Here we have a man who misled the leaders of our Government. Here we have a man who conceded and boasted that although he misled them, he achieved his purpose of getting the United States to invade Iraq. Here we have a man accused of selling secrets to the enemy, to Iran, and endangering American troops. And where do we find Ahmad Chalabi today? He is being hosted and feted by this administration. This man is in Washington with his motorcade moving around town, having appointments with Treasury Secretary Snow and the Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice. Today, he is going to share his wise view of the world with the conservative think tank, the American Enterprise Institute. This is a hard story to explain. Hard to explain to the American people; harder still to explain to American troops. How can a man who has been accused and is under investigation for passing secrets from the United States to the Iranians and endangering the lives of our troops and national security now be the toast of the town in Washington, DC? How can a man under active investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a man who has not been called for any statement or any testimony, be this guest at the highest levels of our Government? Congressman George Miller has been involved in this inquiry, as I have. He has made it clear, and I agree with him, when it comes to Ahmad Chalabi we shouldn't be serving him lunch, we ought to be serving him with a subpoena. We shouldn't treat him like a hero, we should treat him like a suspect in a case that may have endangered the lives of our troops. I don't understand it. We need to call on the Intelligence Committee as well as the Department of Justice to use the tools they have to subpoena Ahmad Chalabi to make certain he answers the hard questions about how he misled our Government into invading Iraq and what he did to endanger the lives of our troops and our national security. Nothing less should be allowed when it comes to protecting our troops.

Fifty years ago, Chapter 0336 was formed by 17 NARFE members in Rapid City, SD. Today, the chapter's membership has grown to include over 200 persons. As many of my colleagues know, NARFE has been instrumental in protecting the rights of retired Federal and civilian employees. The importance of Federal employees is well illustrated by the overwhelming majority of those in the Chamber today. Federal and civilian employment is an essential component of governmental efficiency. These employees are the backbone of our great country, and those who devote their lives to public service deserve to know that they will retire with dignity. By acting as an advocate for these retirees, NARFE not only ensures that retirees receive the benefits that were promised to them but also aims to improve future conditions for current Federal and civilian employees. The years of experience on Capitol Hill and in Federal agencies have made NARFE a name respected by Members of Congress and a key player in the Federal community.

My wife's grandmother, 97-year-old Betty Carswell is still alive and in good health. She is on Social Security and she needs it. When I was a boy, growing up down the street my good friend Ross Fox's dad died, and when he died, leaving Mrs. Fox with two young boys to take care of, Social Security was there to protect them. Yet today Social Security is in trouble. By the year 2030, it will be out of money. There are six positive steps we can take, however, to protect and preserve Social Security. Number one is to have some principles, to say that the benefits for current retirees and near retirees will not be increased; number two, to lock away the Social Security surplus so that the money will not be spent on roads and bridges but used only for Social Security; number three, taxes for Social Security should not be increased; number four, the government should not invest Social Security funds in the stock market; number five, modernization of Social Security should not change the disability and survivors' components for friends like Ross Fox, who lose their loved one, their parents; number six, a portion of the Social Security account should be personalized so that younger people on a voluntary basis would have the option of putting theirs in an interest-bearing account which earns more money than Social Security. Mr. Speaker, we can do this. We can have a good voluntary program to set up to protect and preserve Social Security. Our seniors need this and our future generations.","word.count":267,"sep11":-1.19662921348315,"years":2000.66292134831,"days":2016,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.222778566828873,"Topic 2":0.292625801992934,"Topic 3":0.0239134927323347,"Topic 4":0.282520140916065,"Topic 5":0.00996747899342681,"Topic 6":0.0343180519463903,"Topic 7":0.102578590891669,"Topic 8":0.00768595769853657,"Topic 9":0.0130224233965067,"Topic 10":0.0105894946032634},{"id":"10419960013972","body":"George Gekas: Mr. Speaker, I said I was going to search the Record to determine if any similar speeches were made by his colleagues on his side.

Congressman Stearns and I agree on one thing: The provisions relating to the United Nations in the bill before us are unacceptable. Unfortunately, that is where our agreement on this issue ends. I believe the funding level this bill includes for the U.N. is woefully inadequate. The United States owes more than $1 billion to the U.N. in arrears. But this bill provides just $475 million--less than half--of our debt. And it makes even that small amount contingent upon the enactment of legislation authorizing this funding, which, conveniently enough, is lying dead in a dormant conference committee. So I too think that we need to change the U.N. provisions included in this bill. But Mr. Stearns' amendment goes in exactly the wrong direction. This amendment hinders the United States from taking even the first, paltry step included in this bill toward fulfilling its debt to the U.N. Mr. Stearns cloaks his amendment in the rhetoric of reform, and claims that his amendment will somehow take us down that path. But let's be very clear, Mr. Chairman. This amendment is not about U.N. reform. This amendment is simply about blocking the United States from fulfilling its financial obligations to the U.N. I don't think there is anyone in this House who is not supportive of further U.N. reform. That is why we worked to elect Secretary General Kofi Annan. That is why the U.N. has begun to implement reforms developed and demanded by the United States. And that is why we will continue to advocate far-reaching reforms throughout the U.N. system. The United States has a tremendous amount of influence within the U.N., but that level of influence is rapidly decreasing. Our debt to the U.N. is draining our power in the organization, creating a climate of resistance to U.S. proposals and even endangering our vote in the General Assembly. The U.N. has historically served U.S. interests, but our debt is making it hard for the organization to carry out its activities. The Stearns amendment will only make this situation worse. In the interest of U.S. national security and in the interest of reforming the U.N., I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Stearns amendment.","word.count":377,"sep11":-3.18258426966292,"years":1998.67696629213,"days":1309,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.026849878387855,"Topic 2":0.173835113727319,"Topic 3":0.00858347993096193,"Topic 4":0.00573352776287441,"Topic 5":0.499569181114018,"Topic 6":0.00711517732086172,"Topic 7":0.00502144665133697,"Topic 8":0.0266348176505298,"Topic 9":0.0714737970932678,"Topic 10":0.175183580360976},{"id":"10419950007036","body":"Steve Chabot: Mr. Speaker, $8 billion, that sure is a lot of money, and it just happens to be the amount of extra Washington big government spending that President Clinton wants.

In the fifth amendment it says a person's property cannot be taken away without due process of law, and all we are doing is putting people's rights relative to property under the same constitutional rights as all the others, which they have not had up to this point. I introduced H.R. 4772, the Private Property Rights Implementation Act, earlier this year to help Americans defend their constitutionally protected rights. And I want to thank the gentleman from Tennessee for his leadership in this area and for being the principal Democratic cosponsor. We thank him very much for that. Most Americans are familiar with one recent decision involving all Americans' property rights, which Chairman Sensenbrenner referred to earlier, the case of Kelo v. The City of New London, in which the Supreme Court held that the Constitution allows government to take private property from one citizen and give it to businesses. The House of Representatives acted to correct that decision by passing H.R. 4128, under the leadership of Chairman Sensenbrenner, by a very wide margin, 376-38. However, the Supreme Court, during its last term, handed down another bad decision that fails to protect the private property rights of all Americans, and correcting that decision through this legislation we will be addressing today should have the same bipartisan support. Here is the problem: strange as it sounds, under current law property owners are now blocked from raising a Federal fifth amendment takings claim in Federal court. Here is why: The Supreme Court's 1985 decision in which Williamson County v. Hamilton Bank requires property owners to pursue to the end all available remedies for just compensation in State court before the property owner can file suit in Federal court under the fifth amendment. Then just last year, in the case of San Remo Hotel v. City and County of San Francisco, also referred to by Chairman Sensenbrenner, the Supreme Court held that once a property owner tries their case in State court, the property owner is prohibited from having their constitutional claim heard in Federal court even though the property owner never wanted to be in the State court with their Federal claim in the first place. The combination of these two rules means that those with Federal property rights claims are effectively shut out of Federal court on their Federal takings claims, setting them unfairly apart from those asserting any other Federal rights such as those asserting free speech or religious freedom rights, as I mentioned before. The late Chief Justice Rehnquist commented directly on this unfairness, observing in his concurring opinion in San Remo that ``the Williamson County decision all but guarantees that claimants will be unable to utilize the Federal courts to enforce the fifth amendment's just compensation guarantee.'' The Second Circuit Court of Appeals has also noted that ``it is both ironic and unfair if the very procedure that the Supreme Court required property owners to follow before bringing a fifth amendment takings claim, a State court takings action, also precluded them from ever bringing a fifth amendment takings claim'' in Federal court. H.R. 4772, the Private Property Rights Implementation Act, this act, which I introduced along with, again, Congressman Gordon, will correct the unfair legal bind that catches all property owners in what amounts to a catch-22. This bill, which is based on Congress's clear authority to define the jurisdiction of the Federal courts and the appellate jurisdiction of the U.S. Supreme Court, would allow property owners raising Federal takings claims to have their cases decided in Federal court without first pursuing a wasteful and unnecessary litigation detour, and possible dead end, in State court. H.R. 4772 would also remove another artificial barrier blocking property owners' access to Federal court. The Supreme Court's Williamson County decision also requires that before a case can be brought for review in Federal court, property owners must first obtain a final decision from the State government on what is an acceptable use of their land. This has created an incentive for regulatory agencies to avoid making a final decision at all by stringing out the process and thereby forever denying a property owner access to court. Studies of takings cases in the 1990s indicate that it took property owners nearly a decade of litigation, which most property owners cannot afford, before takings claims were ready to be heard on the merits in any court. To prevent that unjust result, H.R. 4772 would clarify when a final decision has been achieved and when the case is ready for Federal court review. Under this bill if a land use application is reviewed by the relevant agency and rejected, a waiver is requested and denied, and an administrative appeal is also rejected, then a property owner can bring their Federal constitutional claim in a Federal court. The bill would not change the way agencies resolve disputes. Rather, H.R. 4772 simply makes clear the steps the property owner must take to make their case ready for court review. H.R. 4772 also clarifies the rights of property owners raising certain types of constitutional claims in the following ways: First, it would clarify that conditions that are imposed upon a property owner before they can receive a development permit must be proportional to the impact that development might have on the surrounding community. Second, it would clarify that if property units are individually taxed under State law, then the adverse economic impact of a regulation has on a piece of property should be measured by determining how much value the regulating is taking away from the individual lot affected, not the development as a whole. And, third, the bill would clarify that due process violations involving property rights should be found when the Government has been found to have acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner. This legislation also applies the same clarifications to cases in which the Federal Government is taking the private property. And I would just note that some of the groups that strongly support this legislation are the home builders, the Realtors, the Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Independent Business and the U.S. Farm Bureau. I would urge my colleagues to join in supporting this bipartisan legislation. I want to again thank Mr. Gordon for his leadership.","word.count":1101,"sep11":5.1685393258427,"years":2007.02808988764,"days":4282,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.759334386785147,"Topic 2":0.020626257576617,"Topic 3":0.00542265120420101,"Topic 4":0.0798492431994458,"Topic 5":0.00284571689941693,"Topic 6":0.00609878330826253,"Topic 7":0.0598601114786426,"Topic 8":0.0195454226688295,"Topic 9":0.0432899261765936,"Topic 10":0.00312750070284433},{"id":"10519980033166","body":"Jerrold Nadler: Mr. Speaker, the conduct of the President over the last 8 months and before will be judged in this proceeding.

It is grossly unfair because, with respect to the 2,200 pages of evidence and the 17 boxes of other evidence, the entire Committee on the Judiciary is going to see it, to decide what must be kept confidential and protecting privacy of third parties.

Maloney: Thank you very much, Madam President. I compliment my friend and colleague from Georgia for bringing to the attention of the American people issues which the Senate needs to work, and it needs to move forward with the Nation's business. We have found it increasingly difficult because we have been frustrated by the obstructionist tactics by Members of the Democratic Party in the Senate. The Senate is a great body in which to serve. It is a body that has rules that are open for debate. I like that. It is a body where it is easy to have amendments. You can amend anything. You can have any amendment on any issue. It does not have to be germane. I happen to like that. I will defend that right. It gives the minority enormous power to influence and delay and obstruct. Right now we have seen the minority using a lot of the Senate rules to obstruct, to delay, and to make it very difficult to pass legislation. Unfortunately, a lot of that legislation is very much needed. We have before the Senate right now for example the Department of Defense appropriations bill. I have been around here a long time. I cannot remember anybody ever filibustering that bill because we all know it needs to pass. We know we need to fund the military. We need to make decisions on how many people we are going to have in the Armed Forces and what we are going to pay them. We need to have decisions made on what we are going to buy as far as airplanes, as far as equipment, as far as munitions, and as far as research and development. We may have differences of opinion on how much, but we have to make those decisions. You cannot make the decision unless you have the bill on the floor. In this case, we have Senators Inouye and Stevens, two of our more respected Members and two of our more talented legislators, who have been totally frustrated for 3 days trying to bring that bill to the floor. They are ready to go to work. I remember seeing both Senators having their notebooks and ready to go to work. That was on Wednesday afternoon. We have yet to have any substantive, real debate on the Department of Defense appropriations bill because a couple of Senators--and I respect their rights--are filibustering that bill because they think this will delay consideration of the nuclear waste disposal bill, which may come up after DOD. So, if they can filibuster and tie up the DOD appropriations bill, maybe that will help protect them as far as the nuclear waste bill. I disagree with that strategy. I respect the Senators from Nevada, and I respect their right to try to protect their State. But by delaying action on the Department of Defense bill, I do not think they are helping their case one iota as far as Nevada is concerned. That is just the latest tactic. That is rather unusual--very unusual, I might say--to filibuster one bill, particularly a bill as important as the Department of Defense bill, to hopefully influence legislation on the nuclear waste bill, or a bill that is coming subsequently; very unusual in my opinion; not a good tactic, in my opinion; not helpful for the Senate. The Senate needs to do its work on the appropriations bills. If people have philosophical differences on different issues which they feel strongly about, they have a right to filibuster those, but not really on appropriations bills. It does not make any sense to filibuster appropriations bills. We know we have to pass these appropriations bills. They are all important. They probably all spend money that we should not spend, however, if Senators disagree with the way some of the money is spent, they can have amendments to strike that spending, to reduce the spending or to increase the spending. That is the way the system should work. We should not filibuster appropriations bills. We should give priority to appropriations bills over many others because we know we have to do that. We have to pass these bills. Again, we can fight, wrestle, argue, and amend over what the amount of money should be in those bills. But I think all of them agree that we should spend some money in each one of those 13 accounts for appropriations. To date, in the Senate, unfortunately, we have only passed one--military construction. We need to pass the Department of Defense appropriations bill. Hopefully, we will be able to get back to that on Tuesday and move forward. That is not the only case of obstruction that we have seen from our Democratic colleagues. Senator Coverdell mentioned the health care bill, the so-called Kassebaum-Kennedy bill. That bill passed the Senate in April by a vote of 100 to 0. The House has already passed it. The normal course of procedure is that we would appoint conferees and work out the differences between the House and the Senate. We have some differences between the House and the Senate--however, these are not real substantive differences in too many areas. But we need to go to conference to work them out. Senator Kennedy has obstructed that. He has objected to appointing conferees indicating he would filibuster any effort to appoint conferees. He may well have the opportunity to filibuster it. I think we need to make a decision. Are we going to allow one Senator to deny us the opportunity to go to conference for final action on a bill that passed the Senate 100 to 0? I think Senator Kennedy is wrong in objecting to this bill. This bill is an important bill. It bears his name--the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill. It has a lot of provisions that are agreed upon with strong bipartisan support. We made some improvements in that bill as originally introduced. I remember some of our colleagues saying that we cannot amend that bill, that, if we amend it, we threaten the bill. We did amend it. We put in a provision that I know is of interest to the Presiding Officer that allows the self-employed to have deductions for health insurance rising from 30 to 80 percent. That is a very important provision, a good provision, one that passed. Nobody objected to it. We included it in the Finance Committee action. No one objected to it on the Senate floor. It must be a great provision. It certainly is common sense. It has some equity for taxes as far as health care is concerned. Major corporations get to deduct 100 percent. Why would a self-employed person only get to deduct 30 percent? It does not make sense. Now at least that is increased to 80 percent. It takes 7 years to get there. But that is a positive provision. Senator Kennedy right now is objecting to that provision because we are not able to get this bill to conference. I find that very important. He has objected now for 80 days; almost a record. I cannot find any bill that anybody has objected to longer for appointing conferees. If he wants to filibuster the bill when it comes out of conference, he has that right, and I respect that right. I may not agree with him, but at least I respect somebody who is abiding by the rules. Under the rules, you can filibuster appointment of conferees. That is what he is doing. But what he is doing is denying 25 million Americans portability between group insurance and individual insurance. In other words, if they leave a group--maybe they are working for a company that has health insurance and they are fired, or they quit, or they have to move, for whatever reason, and they want to go into a different plan--this bill says they will be able to move their insurance. They will be able to get coverage either in an individual policy or another group policy. That is a good provision. It has strong bipartisan support. By blocking the appointment of conferees, Senator Kennedy is not allowing us to take that up and pass it, and put it on the President's desk and have it become law. Ostensibly the reason the Democrats are objecting to appointing conferees is they do not like medical savings accounts. The House has a medical savings accounts provision that basically makes it available as an option for, I believe, most Americans. The Senate had a close vote, 52 to 46, on medical savings accounts. We were not successful in having a broad medical savings accounts provision. And so since the Democrats do not want medical savings accounts they have refused to let the conference go forward. Even yesterday, the minority leader, Senator Daschle, said if you will give us the medical savings accounts provision or let us define it, then we will go to conference. That is not the way we do business. If we did business that way, the minority would say, well, we will not let you go to conference until we see the final outcome. In other words, the conference does not make any difference; we will write the final package or we do not have a bill or we will not go to conference. I disagree with that. That is a crummy way to legislate. That is not good, and we should not let it happen. And, frankly, we are not going to let it happen. The proposals we have made in an effort to compromise on this bill are several. We have already said that we would drop medical malpractice liability reform that the House had in their bill and we did not have in our bill. We have already said, well, that will be dropped. We dropped purchasing alliances for small businesses. In my opinion, we should not have dropped it, but we did. So we have made several compromises. On medical savings accounts, we said that instead of making the medical savings accounts open for all people in the country, as I think we should, we will confine it to small business, to businesses with 50 or less, and the self-employed. I think that is a very minimal move toward medical savings accounts. As of yesterday, Senator Kennedy and others think that is still too generous. They do not want to give self-employed people the right to have a medical savings account or they do not want to give a small business with 50 or less employees the right to start a medical savings account. What are they afraid of? That it is going to work? Are they afraid they are going to be popular? Are they ","word.count":210,"sep11":-5.89606741573034,"years":1995.96348314607,"days":343,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.913036207500969,"Topic 2":0.0279099760237305,"Topic 3":0.00614410608218298,"Topic 4":0.0150300089708128,"Topic 5":0.00581997288817041,"Topic 6":0.00664628172808775,"Topic 7":0.00477023288189616,"Topic 8":0.0113634622704132,"Topic 9":0.00667332542330853,"Topic 10":0.00260642623042832},{"id":"10419960041461","body":"Dana Rohrabacher: I think the President's action concerning the Travelgate affair does indeed show the character of the individual we are now talking about who happens to be President of the United States. I worked in the White House for 7 years and knew Billy Dale very well, and the public should understand whom we are talking about here. We are not talking about a political appointee, who was appointed by the Republicans, who happened to be a holdover. No. Billy Dale is a civil servant. He is a veteran who ran an office in the White House that had served President Carter as well as President Ford and as well as Ronald Reagan, a man who is just a civil servant like other civil servants, whose patriotism is demonstrated in the hard work and long hours that he takes in a job that is different than other civil service jobs, because he had to travel with the President, he had to make sure things are done. Sometimes they work until midnight, but as a civil servant, he does not get overtime pay. This is someone whose patriotism was expressed in the fact that he was doing his very best job for those who held the office. And that is the way it was with all those folks down in the travel office; we knew that. They were regular human beings, they were people that, you know, spend their times with their family and churches, and they are totally nonpolitical. You could always go to them with a problem, and they were there to help. Well, these people were fired precipitously when President Clinton became President. Now why were they fired? Well, we know now that they were fired because the President had some cronies that he wanted to put in the office. One was an attractive female, and one had to do with a crony who basically was engaged in a travel company that wanted to get contracts, that had something to do with who was handling the travel office. Well, before we can do that, of course, we have to get rid of these just average Americans. But who cares about them? Who cares about these civil servants? What is significant is not only the President was off base and that the White House was off base in this matter, but that once that act happened, once it happened, it was a wrong thing to do. Instead of admitting that they made a mistake, the White House set out to destroy these people, to destroy them, not just to fire them, but to charge then with improprieties and illegalities and to actually bring legal and criminal charges against them to utterly destroy them. In order to what? In order to make sure there was no political damage for the President for making a wrong decision. This is the nature of the person who is occupying the Presidency of the United States today. This is wrong. This indicates an arrogance; it indicates an absolute disregard for other human beings. How can you look at another human being and treat them in that way? I would not treat my enemies in that way. I would not charge my enemies with crimes that they did not commit in order to gain some type of upsmanship in a political match. I would not do that. This is even worse than that. This is charging a civil servant with crimes in order to give yourself a political advantage, someone who is not even your political enemy. Let us just note that this wrongdoing was recognized almost immediately by the jury, and within 2 hours, as we said, Billy Dale and these loyal civil servants, these loyal Americans who had worked their lives out in this particular spot in the White House, they were totally exonerated, and then what was the President's action? When we tried to ensure that these people would not have to sell their homes, that these people would not have to have all of their life savings drained away because they had to have such legal bills, what then did the President do? Do you remember? The President at first agreed, OK--well, through his spokesman--well, yeah, we will sign the bill if the Congress passes a bill to take care of their legal fees, and then he took it back. And then he took it back because he says he wants the legal fees of these people who were charged with criminal activity themselves to be paid by the Government or we cannot take care of these people who were just absolutely victims of his own misdeeds.","word.count":775,"sep11":-5.08426966292135,"years":1996.77528089888,"days":632,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.115822631376413,"Topic 2":0.137568273618243,"Topic 3":0.00383617085660787,"Topic 4":0.047722628864741,"Topic 5":0.00445419952175383,"Topic 6":0.00281446264724205,"Topic 7":0.673851517589183,"Topic 8":0.00381773525769839,"Topic 9":0.00839038554813532,"Topic 10":0.00172199471998349},{"id":"10620000003586","body":"Fred Upton: Madam Speaker, in my remaining minute I would just again urge my colleagues to support this bill.

S. 1026 was introduced by Senator Robert Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey, on June 13, 2001. The late Detective Sergeant Pat King, a member of the Long Branch Police Force was born in Morristown, New Jersey, in 1952 and lived most of his life in Long Branch. As a 21-year veteran of the police force, Detective King was the most decorated police officer in the city's history and the only Long Branch police officer to receive the Medal of Valor. Sadly, he was killed in the line of duty by a career criminal on November 20, 1997. Officer King is survived by his wife Maureen and his two sons. Mr. Speaker, I wish to commend the House sponsor of this bill, the gentleman from New Jersey , for his hard work and dedication in seeking to honor the life and work of Detective King by naming the Long Branch post office after him. The gentleman from New Jersey was the sponsor of H.R. 2997 and has been pursuing the passage of legislation naming the post office after Detective King since the 106th Congress. I am proud to say that with the House passage of the Senate version of that bill, his efforts will finally be realized. In keeping with the long-standing tradition of naming post offices after individuals who have made differences in their communities, I am pleased to lend my support to S. 1026, naming the post office after a police officer who gave his life defending the community. I also want to thank the chairman of the Committee on Government Reform, the gentleman from Indiana , his staff, and the ranking member, the gentleman from California , for moving this bill to the floor. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bill, and I withdraw my reservation of objection.","word.count":453,"sep11":-0.606741573033708,"years":2001.25280898876,"days":2226,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.108592276626307,"Topic 2":0.334238062959289,"Topic 3":0.0248373717954667,"Topic 4":0.0361551098466971,"Topic 5":0.0405822330620226,"Topic 6":0.0202693604446033,"Topic 7":0.328440016862602,"Topic 8":0.0382703956927173,"Topic 9":0.0544806185340232,"Topic 10":0.0141345541762719},{"id":"11020070068200","body":"Claire McCaskill: Mr. President, first, I have had the opportunity to listen to my colleague from the great State of Iowa, and I want to tell Senator Grassley that I couldn't agree with him more in the speech he just gave concerning the leadership of the Smithsonian museum. I find it is not dissimilar to some of the problems we found from time to time with college presidents of public universities, that somehow we get off the beaten path in terms of taxpayer funding. I certainly commend him for the work he is doing in that area. I rise this afternoon, however, to talk a little bit about something that is so close to the heart of our democracy, and that is the rule of law. As a very young lawyer out of law school, I was very blessed to have the opportunity to begin my legal career as an assistant prosecuting attorney in the courtrooms of Jackson County, in Kansas City, MO. I learned so much in those first few years that I toiled as an assistant prosecutor. I had a felony docket, and I was learning from great prosecutors. It is inspiring when I think back on the quality of legal work that was going on in those courtrooms on behalf of the public by the prosecuting attorneys who worked there for very little money. I was mentored on the rules of evidence and on courtroom strategy, but, most importantly, I was mentored on the rules as they relate to the ethics of a prosecutor. Where is that line and how do you draw it? How does a prosecutor make the decision as to whether this is justice in terms of a sentence or this is not justice, and it must be put in the hands of a jury when you are trying to decide plea bargains. Charging decisions: how do you decide when someone is charged with a felony or whether you let it go with a misdemeanor, or perhaps not charge at all? Those lessons were so fundamental to the work that was done. It was from that experience that I began to revere--revere the rule of law in the United States of America. It is fundamental to our democracy. It is the engine that runs our democracy. It is the envy of the rest of the world. As I have traveled from time to time in other countries, I have seen this firsthand. I will never forget a time when I was in a foreign country and we got pulled over by a police officer. We asked the native who was helping us around the country that day: What is this? He said we have to pay him. I remember thinking to myself how fortunate we are in America that there isn't an ingrained system of bribery on the streets of our cities because we have this rule of law. What is the heart of the rule of law? At its very essence, if you strip away everything else, what is core and central to the rule of law? It is the independent prosecutor. It doesn't matter if you become a prosecutor by election or selection. Once you take that oath, once you raise your hand and swear to the job that you are about to take, you must become blindfolded to any political considerations. You must see all lawbreakers as equal whether the lawbreaker is a Congressman, a police officer, or a high school dropout who is unemployed. What is so offensive about the e-mail traffic that has been discovered at the Department of Justice surrounding the firing of eight prosecutors in the Federal criminal justice system has been their reference to loyalty--``loyal Bushies''--loyalty to the President and, by implication, to his party. Prosecutors I have known, and I am lucky that I have known hundreds, have loyalty to only one thing, and that is to the law. Good American prosecutors are slaves to the facts of the case and loyal only to the law of this great country. They have great power, prosecutors in our country. The decisions they make, as they apply those facts to our law, can achieve justice. Those same decisions can also ruin lives. What is happening right now in the United States as it relates to these eight U.S. attorneys, frankly, isn't that important in the grand scheme of things to those eight U.S. attorneys, or those eight prosecutors. Am I sorry that they have been caught up in what appears to be a political scandal as it relates to their firing? Am I sorry that they have been maligned, and it was said that they were underperforming when, in reality, this was about being a ``loyal Bushie''? By the way, I am quoting the e-mail when I say ``loyal Bushie.'' That is the only reason I would use that term on the floor of the Senate, quoting that document. What really is happening is very important to all the other prosecutors across the United States of America, particularly those prosecutors in the Federal system because, frankly, what the Justice Department is implying is if you still have your job as U.S. attorney, you are loyal to the President of the United States and that is why you kept your job; not that you were loyal to the law. The Attorney General's action implies they kept their jobs because they were loyal to the President. It is not OK to judge a prosecutor through a prism of political loyalty. The facts show that these decisions included discussions of the prosecutor's loyalty to the President, and because of that fact, and that fact alone, the Attorney General owes them and the rest of America much more than an apology. He owes them his resignation. Also, as a young prosecutor, I was very fortunate to have a man who was a mentor to me and continued to be a mentor until, very sadly, the end of his life just a few days ago. He was a great politician, and there is no place he would prefer to be called that than on the floor of the Senate. There is a hole in the heart of Missouri with the death of Senator Tom Eagleton. He was a giant among leaders and leaves a legacy that should guide public servants and Senators for generations to come. Beginning in 1956, at the age of 27, he also became a prosecutor. He was elected the prosecutor of St. Louis city, a circuit attorney. In a brief 12-year span, he became elected prosecutor of St. Louis, went on to be elected to the attorney general's position and then on to Lieutenant Governor and on to U.S. Senate--a whirling dervish of energy, intellect, and ambition. In 1968, when Missourians sent our ``boy wonder'' to Washington, we knew he would achieve greatness, and he certainly didn't disappoint us. Within his first term, he had already begun to turn the tide on the environmental damage that had ensued within the half century after the industrial revolution by helping craft the Clean Air Act of 1970 and the Clean Water Act of 1972. He was a strong advocate for children with disabilities and created the National Institute on Aging. While much of what Senator Eagleton did in the Senate made a true impact on America and the world, no action may have been as great as his handwritten amendment that stopped the bombing in Cambodia. This courageous act changed the course of history by subsequently ending the Vietnam war. His complete grasp of the complexities of foreign policy continued until his death. As he talked to me in February of 2005 and tried to convince me to run for the Senate, he said to me: Claire, this war in Iraq is a disaster and, believe me, it is going to get much worse before it gets better. Even in the later years of his life, he was a virtual fountain of information about foreign policy across the world. Despite the fact that Senator Eagleton was a scholar at Amherst College in Massachusetts and Oxford and a cum laude graduate from Harvard Law School and prominent attorney and politician, he could relate to anybody. ``Just call me Tom,'' he would always say, with a warm grin and a firm handshake. That was his style--plainspoken, genuine, and usually the funniest man in the room. His ability to be the voice of everyday Americans was the reason he was elected to three terms in the U.S. Senate and the same reason it was so hard for him to leave public service in 1986. But, characteristically, he left office with very modest words. He said: And that he certainly did. In the famous style and personality that was Tom Eagleton, he went from public office but not from public life. A university lecturer, political commentator, writer, philanthropic fundraiser, community advocate, sports enthusiast, Tom continued to pursue dreams of a different kind. While Tom shied away from claiming due credit, his good friend and colleague from the other side of the aisle, Senator John Danforth, summed up his amazing political career by saying: More than what Americans gained from his victories, achievements, degrees, and accolades is the lessons we find in his words that we can take into the future: His memorial service was a wonderful tribute to Tom Eagleton. We all laughed and we cried. Some giants from the Senate were in attendance, and some Democratic ward workers from a nearby political ward who had been working the phones and putting up yard signs for 30, 40 years--all sat together and listened to great stories about a great man. We all appreciated the fact that Senator Tom Eagleton wanted the last word. So, a year before his death, he wrote a letter--I would like to make it part of the Record today--that everyone who attended the memorial service was lucky enough to receive. It talks about his life, it talks about his service in the Senate, it talks about the things that were important to him, and about his family--which was most important to him. But you got the sense of the man even from his farewell address, and I will close today by using the last line he used in the letter he wrote that he wanted distributed at his memorial service: I ask unanimous consent the letter be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:","word.count":1755,"sep11":5.66011235955056,"years":2007.51966292135,"days":4457,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0290487734095593,"Topic 2":0.579386246564663,"Topic 3":0.0228510891192828,"Topic 4":0.00875274173154505,"Topic 5":0.0273653989244161,"Topic 6":0.00435316062351548,"Topic 7":0.00986572649273303,"Topic 8":0.0337079883560019,"Topic 9":0.158016142086671,"Topic 10":0.126652732691613},{"id":"10519970044383","body":"Edward Kennedy: Mr. President, I rise today to join in the introduction of the Child Care A.C.C.E.S.S. Act. The initiative is designed to improve access, quality and affordability of child care. Access to child care is a necessity for all working parents. Nationwide, 55% of children under age six have both parents or their single parent in the labor force. That figure rises to 61% of school age children who have both or their only parent in the labor force. In my home state of New Mexico, 54% of preschool and 63% of school age children have both or their only parent in the workforce. Another way of thinking of the magnitude of the issue is to consider that more than half of all preschool children are away from their parents most of the day and two out of three school age children are likely to require child care before or after school. With the passage of the TANF legislation in 1997, a number of mothers will be entering the workforce for the first time and will require child care if they are to succeed in the job market. Mr. President, while I may not agree with every portion of the bill, I believe that we need to improve child care access, quality, and affordability for our working families. I believe that this bill affords us the best approach to these child care issues and urge others to join in support of this initiative. Access is a problem for many parents and expansion of the child care and development block grants is one step toward increasing the availability of child care programs. Accessibility grows even more complicated when we look at our rural areas of the country. Each community has unique circumstances to overcome, such as a lack of resources, programs, and transportation. Since the issues of availability and access are addressed in this initiative, I am hopeful that individual states will be able to address their most critical needs. Yet, Mr. President, improving access without improving the quality of the child care is an empty gesture. Staff education and training are among the most critical elements in improving quality. Currently, many states do not require providers who care for children in their homes to have any training prior to serving children. I am told that 33 states allow teachers in child care centers to start work without prior training. This legislation includes incentives to encourage states to invest in activities that will enhance provider-child ratios, improve the enforcement of licensing standards, improve the compensation of child care providers, and offer training and education to child care providers. It is essential that we have child care staff who are trained to provide the necessary care and then have salaries commensurate with their training to retain them in the field. It is a credit to those who have worked in crafting this bill that they have ensured that child care for children with special health care needs will be addressed as well. My state currently has many families who cannot find the quality, affordable child care they need to ensure that their children are well cared for and safe. Currently, child care is unaffordable for many working families in New Mexico. Full day child care for one child can easily cost $4,000 to $10,000 per year, which is a lot of money in a state where the average per capita income is $18,803. This is beyond the reach of many families. These families simply cannot afford the cost of quality child care in addition to all of the other demands on their monthly budget. Increasing the Child Care and Development Block Grants will increase the amount of child care subsidies available to working families. Finally, Mr. President, this bill addresses a critical area: the issue of after school care for school age children. Good after school options can help children and teens do well in school and stay out of trouble. It is estimated that nearly 5 million children are left unsupervised by an adult after school each week. Studies have shown that juvenile crime actually peaks between 3:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. when many children are unsupervised. Additionally, I am told that one study found that eighth graders left home alone after school reported greater use of cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana than those who were in adult supervised settings. Our initiative will allow us to strengthen local resources and is designed to improve the quality of care in after school programs. In closing, the legislation covers the full spectrum of child care from early childhood to adolescent after school needs. I look forward to participating in the debate on making child care affordable and accessible. I am hopeful that the Senate will move forward on these issues of utmost importance to our working families, parents and children alike.","word.count":352,"sep11":-4.75561797752809,"years":1997.10393258427,"days":749,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.331355851730572,"Topic 2":0.059353312311359,"Topic 3":0.0175453556902823,"Topic 4":0.0163451203275856,"Topic 5":0.179775723424899,"Topic 6":0.0263291029900551,"Topic 7":0.0982244804269576,"Topic 8":0.220594778320016,"Topic 9":0.00607917349198358,"Topic 10":0.0443971012862898},{"id":"10519970040403","body":"William Delahunt: Mr. Speaker, I would beg all the Members to roll up their pants.

There are people like that, I am sure, but they are an extremely small minority. The vast majority of people we are concerned about are people such as Sarah. Sarah is a 19-year-old girl in southern California. She was born in Mexico and adopted at the age of 4. English is her primary language. She lives at home with her family. She is adored by her parents and her five older siblings. She is also an illegal immigrant. Why is she an illegal immigrant? It turns out that Sarah's parents made a crucial mistake at the time of adoption. They didn't apply for citizenship. The family wrongly assumed that she automatically became a citizen when they completed the formal adoption procedures in the California courtroom. No one told them they had to file separately for citizenship. It was only last year when they decided to take a trip to Mexico and asked for a passport that they realized Sarah is here illegally. Is this someone who managed to sneak across the border and is living in violation of the law? There are thousands of Sarahs who are, frankly, looking for relief in Congress and who can make a contribution to the United States. But the fact that we have not brought a serious immigration bill--but for one H-1B visa bill--before Congress is the reason this President has put his foot down and said: Congress, don't go home until you address this problem. There are people such as Sarah across America who deserve fair treatment. Frankly, they have been ignored. I count the Senator from Utah as my friend. But I have to say that the Senate Judiciary Committee has not taken up this issue. They have ignored it. He identified the reason: It is controversial. When you talk about immigrants, there are a lot of people who say I know how to exploit that issue. Let me tell you something. I know that is the case in my home State of Illinois. But I happen to be the son of an immigrant. I am very proud of the fact that I serve in this Senate as the son of immigrants. And many of us in this country look to our parents and grandparents as immigrants with great pride. We should look at immigration fairly and honestly and in a legal way. You can't do it if you run away from a debate on immigration law the way we have in the Senate for the last two years. President Clinton, hold your ground. For those across America who are waiting for us to do the fair and right and equitable thing for immigrants, hold your ground. Insist that this Senate, before it goes home, and this Congress, before it leaves to go back to campaign, are fair to those across America who are looking to be treated equitably and justly under our immigration system. I am responding, of course, to what the Senator from Utah raised as an issue. It wasn't the reason I came to the floor, but I feel passionately about it. Senator Kennedy, Senator Reid, and myself are the three major sponsors of the measure on which President Clinton is insisting. They can add, I am sure, during the course of this debate their strong feelings as well.","word.count":595,"sep11":-0.890449438202247,"years":2000.9691011236,"days":2125,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.818741895760369,"Topic 2":0.0593004619401797,"Topic 3":0.0130291587066939,"Topic 4":0.0296020103204561,"Topic 5":0.0130802384902662,"Topic 6":0.013073550364895,"Topic 7":0.0102996799850621,"Topic 8":0.0230674766563861,"Topic 9":0.0139080376105716,"Topic 10":0.00589749016512052},{"id":"10920050033587","body":"Peter DeFazio: Mr. Speaker, this legislation, introduced by my colleague on the Resources Committee, Mr. Mark Udall, presents an exciting opportunity to solve critical water problems in locations with producing oil and gas wells.

This change would allow for an estimated 92,000 reservists, currently age 55 to 59, to retire with full benefits and would restore parity between the retirement systems for Federal civilian employees and reservists. Just to refresh my colleagues' memory, regular military personnel can retire after 20 years of service regardless of their age--38, 48, 55, or 60--and receive their retirement benefits at the time of retirement. As we reflect on the demands placed on our soldiers in Iraq, particularly our Reserve and Guard forces--of which there are roughly 20,000 in theater--there is no more appropriate time to consider this important proposal to support these brave men and women. As a matter of basic fairness, it is only right to restore parity between the retirement age for civilian employees and their Reserve counterparts. When the Reserve retirement system was created in 1947, the retirement age for reservists was identical to the age for civilian employees. At age 60, reservists and Government employees could hang up their uniforms and retire with full benefits. However, since 1947, the retirement age for civilian retirees has been lowered by 5 years while the retirement age has not changed for reservists and guards. The disparate treatment of Federal employees and reservists would have been serious enough had the nature of the work performed by the reservists been steady over the past five decades, but today this country places an increasingly heavy demand on its Ready Reserve, more of a demand than has ever been the case in our Nation's history. Today more than 200,000 reservists have been called up to serve their country in the war on terrorism, and 170,000 of these reservists and Guard troops are now on active duty, here at home and abroad. America's dependence on our Ready Reserve has never been more transparent to the American people. Reservists are now providing security at our Nation's airports, and they patrol the air over our major cities. They provide caps, protection. With call-ups that last several months and take reservists far from home in serving our Nation, it is increasingly clear that reservists are performing the same role as those on active duty and any other service. Before the war on terrorism, reservists were performing 13 million man-days each year--get the idea of how big that is--more than a tenfold increase over the 1 million man-days the Reserves averaged just 10 years ago. It has moved dramatically, even before the war on terrorism began. In fiscal year 2002, reservists contributed 41 million man-days. And this year, in fiscal year 2003, that number will be up again. So we are using our Reserve Forces dramatically more than was ever the case in the history of the Reserve and Guard units. These people are on active duty for an increasing amount of time, particularly as we justify and move forward with the war on terrorism. These are staggering increases. Those defenders of the American people should have that recognized by shortening their time before they are eligible for retirement. In my view, with additional responsibility should come additional benefits. I know this proposal is not without cost. But not improving the reservists' benefits also will have a cost, potentially a severe cost. After all, in recent years we have seen our military struggling to meet recruitment and retention goals. It has been even more severe sometimes with our Guard and Reserve. That has improved somewhat after 9/11. But unless the overall package of incentives is enhanced, there is little reason to believe we will be able to attract and retain highly trained Reserve personnel over the long run, particularly as their deployments and the number of man-hours has increased. Active-duty military personnel have often looked to the Reserves as a way to continue to serve their country while being closer to their families. We have been drawing people out of the active military into the Reserve. With thousands of dollars invested in training active-duty officers and enlisted soldiers, the United States benefits tremendously when personnel decide to continue with the Reserves. But with Reserve deployments increasing in frequency and duration, pulling reservists away from their families and civilian life, imposing real hardships on those families, the advantage in joining the Reserves has been dramatically reduced. There is no question about that. The more we depend on the Reserves, the greater chance we have of losing highly trained former active-duty service men and women and a number of people who have just joined the Active Reserve because they thought it was a way they could supplement income and be involved in supporting our Nation. In my view, the added incentive of full retirement at 55 might provide just the inducement some of them need to stay on despite the surge in deployments. By the way, to illustrate, in the period 1953 to 1990, there were 11 deployments of reservists and guards. Between 1991 and 2001, there have been 50 deployments of reservists and guards. Now those numbers are accelerating as we take on this war on terrorism. It is an enormous change in how we are utilizing our Reserve Forces. I hear from the guards and reservists in New Jersey to whom I spoke directly that one of those things they are most interested in is seeing a shortening of the period before they have access to retirement benefits. It will make a big difference in their lives. They consider it important. Enacting this legislation will send a clear message that our Nation values the increased sacrifice of our reservists during this trying time. This proposal has been endorsed by key members of a broad military coalition, including the Reserve Officers Association, Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Air Force Sergeants Association, the Air Force Association, and Retired Enlisted Association, the Fleet Reserve Association, the Naval Reserve Association, and the National Guard Association. All of the groups that represent these individuals in our system are strongly supporting this initiative. It would restore parity between the Reserves retirement system of our Guard and Reserve and the civilian retirement system, acknowledge the increased workload of reservists, and provide essential personnel with the inducement to join and stay in the Reserves until retirement. I do hope my colleagues will support this amendment. This is the appropriate time given what kind of challenge we are laying down for our National Guard and Reserve across this country. We have increased their responsibilities. We have put severe challenges in front of them and their families, and it is our responsibility, in my view, to recognize that and to address it. I think one of the best ways to do that is to reduce the retirement age for the Reserve and the Guard. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this amendment. With that, I yield the floor.","word.count":1168,"sep11":2.14325842696629,"years":2004.00280898876,"days":3205,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.352890889264451,"Topic 2":0.193184206892061,"Topic 3":0.0210645947180042,"Topic 4":0.0859547639650396,"Topic 5":0.0156922555671724,"Topic 6":0.013330348487108,"Topic 7":0.0607820107658857,"Topic 8":0.0180985822706562,"Topic 9":0.231114104872278,"Topic 10":0.00788824319734408},{"id":"11020080038529","body":"Byron L. Dorgan: The fact is, it is not something I enjoy doing, to talk about the difficulties. I would like to talk about the opportunities for this country. We will not get to the opportunities until we decide we are going to start taking care of some things here at home. This President, in this past fiscal year, the one we are in right now, sent us a request for $196 billion of emergency money and said: I want it put on top of the debt. Don't pay for it. Add it to the debt. That is $16 billion a month, $4 billion a week for Iraq and Afghanistan, to replenish the military accounts for that purpose. Now we are told he is going to send another $70 billion on top of that. That takes us to close to three-quarters of a trillion that will have been spent, none of it paid for, all of it requested by this President as an emergency so it didn't have to be paid for. You look at that and you say to yourself: We have so much that needs doing, including not just on the budget side getting our act together but on the trade side, standing up for our country's interests, demanding fair trade, and, on the investment side, investing in infrastructure, all these things. Last night it was almost as if the President was oblivious to the fundamental causes of the economic difficulty. This is a great economic engine we have, but the fact is, it needs some work. It doesn't need somebody to polish it with a rag and hum a nice tune. It needs real work to get this engine going again. The American people are innovative, great workers. It is an inspired country in which we live. That is why we have progressed the way we have over 200 years. But the American people need something to work with. We need to invest in working people. We need to have faith in working people. Instead what we have done is pulled the rug out from under working families. I have used so many examples in the Senate, and my friend from Ohio knows all of them because a good number of them come from the State of Ohio, Huffy bicycles and Etch A Sketch and so many examples, all those jobs now in China that used to be in Ohio. One of my favorites is to talk about Fig Newton cookies. The National Biscuit Company, NABISCO, took Fig Newton cookies from New Jersey to Mexico. Why? They could find somebody who would shovel fig paste apparently at a much lower cost than it cost to pay somebody to shovel fig paste in New Jersey. If you want to buy some Mexican food, buy Fig Newton cookies, made in Mexico, still called the National Biscuit Company, except it isn't so national anymore. Now they are made in Mexico. That is one example of a hundred, a thousand, a million we could give and have. It is the question of whether this country is going to stand up for its workers and whether we are going to have the courage not just to stand up for workers in fair trade agreements but whether we are also going to put on track fiscal policy, trade policy, regulatory authority in a way that gives people confidence about the future of this economy and jobs and opportunity.","word.count":572,"sep11":6.54775280898876,"years":2008.40730337079,"days":4773,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.746514949327888,"Topic 2":0.0844070894213397,"Topic 3":0.0183637780457605,"Topic 4":0.0390154274246367,"Topic 5":0.0187238754093806,"Topic 6":0.0175150798849644,"Topic 7":0.0146157205104219,"Topic 8":0.0319025652509988,"Topic 9":0.0203689196321107,"Topic 10":0.00857259509249872},{"id":"10519980055798","body":"Pete Domenici: Mr. President, I ask everyone on our side to vote in favor of this amendment.

I reflect upon some of those changes that we have seen over the years with regard to our security. I recall when we brought our security down tighter on boarding our airplanes, it ended up you were very likely to get a fairly extensive spread-eagle search if you bought a one-way ticket. That was an indicator. We all take our shoes off now. Those things happen. There are lineups at the airport. We are paying a lot of TSA officials a lot of money to make sure we are safer, and our baggage is going through x-rays and being checked for bombs. The list goes on and on and on. I have two pair of nail clippers that they broke the tiny little file off the end for fear that would be a weapon. That has been relaxed somewhat. These are reminders, whenever I get the nail clippers out, that is why that is broken off. It is because of terrorists that attacked us in a cowardly way. So after the events that unfolded in Great Britain here in the early or middle part of last month with a plot to blow up perhaps 10 airliners across the Atlantic Ocean on their way over to the United States, in that short period after that, when the regulations changed and they said you can no longer have gel or liquids with you on the airplane, so that covered one set of materials for the ladies and another set of materials for the men, no shaving cream, no toothpaste for either one of us, no lipstick in some of those cases. My wife and I happened to have been stuck in a line that took an hour and a half to get through security. While she watched our luggage, I walked up and down the line and asked people what they thought. Everyone there was unanimous. They said, if I have to give up some liquid or gel or stand in line for an hour or longer, they are making me safe, and if it makes the airline safer, I am happy to stand here. I am proud of that kind of patience and that kind of tolerance, and yet I do the equation and I think now a lot more people are checking their luggage because they want to carry along some liquids. And the numbers of bags have gone up significantly since that period of time. And when you have to go check your baggage, it takes more time. Sometimes you can print your ticket and get on the plane if it is carry-on luggage. So perhaps it is 20 minutes more to get on, and then you have to wait for it to come off the carousel, and that might be another 20 minutes. Maybe 40 minutes of flight multiplied by the thousands of people who are in the air. And it has cost American productivity, Madam Speaker, but we are patient about it. I do caution the American people to always remember why you are standing in that security line, always remember why you are not going to be able to carry your toothpaste or your lotion or whatever it might be. It is because these terrorists are actively plotting to attack us, to kill us because of who we are and what we stand for. They want to kill us because of our freedom. They want to kill us because of our religion. They want to kill us because of our economic success, which is why they attacked the financial centers. So while we are giving up our liquids and while we are standing in line a little while longer, Madam Speaker, I would ask all the American people to remember why that is. Keep focussed on the real goal here. The goal is not to shed enough things out of our luggage that no one is going to be able to bring a bomb on a plane. The goal is to end the motivation of this enemy so all of our freedoms come back to us and so our children and grandchildren will live with the same sense of security and peace and safety that we have lived with all of these years. Remember the frustration. We should be a little frustrated. We should be patient. But we should understand why and who is to blame. And I would just put it into a simple metaphor. There are thousands of people in America that lock their keys in their car. Each day it happens, I imagine, thousands of times around this country. And I think it is pretty rare for anyone to think why that is a problem. Now, we are forgetful folks and we do things by habit. When we get out of our rhythm, we might lock our keys in the car. Then we go get the locksmith or we go find another set of keys. It costs time; it costs money. But how many people who lock their keys in their car think if it were not for the thieves, there would be no such thing as car keys? And how many people that are standing in line at the airport think if it were not for terrorists, there wouldn't be a line? There wouldn't be a TSA. There would simply be people walking, getting to the gate in time to jump on the plane before the door closes, and fly off into the wild blue yonder. That is the way it was before these cowardly acts came, Madam Speaker, and that is the way I pray it is again. But it will not happen until we change the habitat that breeds this kind of terror. And this subject comes back to me as I reflect on a conversation I had with Benazir Bhutto, who was the former Prime Minister of Pakistan. She came to Storm Lake, Iowa, Buena Vista University, to give a speech shortly after September 11, 2001. And after that speech, and it was really an impressive keynote address, I had the privilege to sit down and talk with her in a casual conversation, and it wasn't casual to me but it was casual to her, one on one in a private setting. And I asked her a series of questions, but the most central question was how do we win this war? How do you fight people that are interspersed throughout a population of perhaps 1.3 billion Muslims and in there are the al Qaeda members and the al Qaeda sympathizers? How many are there? Perhaps 130 million would be the answer that I received that night. And how do we defeat them? And former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's response was you have got to give them freedom. You have got to give them an opportunity at democracy. If you do that, they will change their focus from hatred and killing to growing prosperity for their families, their communities, their neighborhoods, their cities, their countries, and their mosques. Now, that is a very human thing to do is to grow that opportunity for the next generations. But you have to have some control of your destiny to be able to do that. And in order to have that control of destiny, you have to have freedom. And this country has never gone to war against another free people. It has always been tyrants and despots, never people who could control their own destiny and elect their own national leaders. And I believe free people can resolve their differences because free people have that control of their destiny and they want to continue to grow and prosper rather than live in hatred. So I was not actually that impressed with that proposal at the time until I did a series of readings in-depth into the Islamic mindset, particularly into the al Qaeda mindset. And after I got into that pretty deep, particularly Daniel Pipes, I came out of that, and I thought I believe Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was right, that we really do need to engage in promoting freedom. But I had simplified this down to change the habitat that breeds terror. Change that habitat. Well, it needs to be for the good. It cannot be for the worse. And that means freedom. That means opportunity. And when the President said that freedom is the right of every person and the hope and the future of every nation, I believe that. Whether it is in our time or whether it is in another time, that is the progress that we are making in that direction. And bold steps were taken by the President in the aftermath of September 11, when he said that they were going to hear us now, the terrorists were going to hear us around this globe. And many said it couldn't done. Many said that going into Afghanistan, no one had ever succeeded in that in history; that it was too dangerous, it was too mountainous, the terrain was too rugged, the local Taliban were too good of fighters, that we couldn't risk our military to go in there. And yet in cooperation and conjunction with the Northern Alliance, we went in there. In a matter of weeks, Afghanistan was liberated. And I recall talking to some Iowa National Guard troops who were on the ground protecting the voting booths and the access and the routes to them, about 750 Iowans deployed in Afghanistan. They were there to help ensure that Afghanis could go to the polls and vote their freedom for the first time ever in the history of the world on that place on this planet. The first time. And now who would argue that the Afghan people are free? Of course they are. And they are making progress and they are moving forward. And they have their troubles, but freedom has always been worth fighting for. And it is something that we see moving in that same direction in Iraq. Iraq has not been as easy. In fact, it has been more difficult. The liberation of Iraq took place very quickly, faster than anyone predicted, Madam Speaker, but in the aftermath there was a lull when there wasn't very much violence and it looked like Iraq was going to heal up the same way that Afghanistan did. But, you know, Iraq has different neighbors than Afghanistan has, and Iraq became the center that brought al Qaeda to Iraq to fight Americans, fight the coalition forces, fight the new Iraqi forces because they realized, as Zarqawi realized, there was no place to retreat to. If they were to lose in Iraq, where else could a terrorist lay his weary head?

I also wanted to thank the representative of the Committee on Rules, the gentleman from Georgia , today for this consideration under an open rule. We, therefore, support the rule. And to my good friend, the gentleman from Iowa , from the committee for as hard as he has worked along with all of us on both sides of the aisle in trying to bring this measure before the full House. This bill obviously has been put together under some of the most trying budget circumstances that we have ever seen. When last year's bill came before us, I said we were trying to stuff a size 10 foot into a shoe that was actually size 7. This in our country that needed more than we could provide in that bill. This year we have a size 6 shoe, and we have a size 11 foot. And so we have many more needs than we can accommodate in this bill. We literally had requests from Members from across our country, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of requests that we could simply not address. They are not addressed in this bill at all. The discretionary portion of this bill totals $16.772 billion, which is a reduction of $67 million over this year, and compared to fiscal year 2003, a reduction of over $1.1 billion. That is nearly a 6 percent reduction compared to 2 years ago. That means that all the Members who came to us for water and sewer projects, rural water and sewer projects, we just simply could not meet the requests. The Women, Infant and Children's food program, though, we have raised it from last year, is probably $150 million short in view of the rising need around our country, the unevenness, of the economy and lackluster job creation. We just simply do not have adequate money in these bills to meet all needs. At the same time, our country is now spending over $100 billion in Iraq and Afghanistan. Imagine if we were able to take and divide that up and give every State in our Union an additional $2 billion, $2 billion that they could share with our localities that are short on funds. We seem to be able to find money for some things around the world. But then we do not find money for very other worthy needs across this Nation. For example, in our Commodity Supplemental Food Program, we want to take surplus food commodities and give them to our food banks and to people who need them. We are about $15 million short in that account, despite all the need across this country and the greater and greater numbers of people coming into our soup kitchens and our feeding kitchens all over this Nation. Meanwhile, in this budget, we have been forced to put money into accounts to take care of what we call invasive species, that is, all these little critters that are coming into our country for which there is no known biological control. The cost of this now totals hundreds of millions of dollars compared to 10 years ago. Whether it is the Asian Longhorned Beetle eating all those trees in Chicago and New York City or whether it is the Emerald Ash Borer in States like Michigan and Ohio, those invasive species are just eating their way through all the forest lands, with those cost burdens now being put on the taxpayer. We basically take this money from a very inadequate allocation and divert it in order to try to prevent additional damage, and really these costs should not be the responsibility of the localities and of the Federal Government but those commercial interests that caused the damage in the first place. I just want to say that agricultural America, and rural small towns, are trying as hard as they can. They have always demonstrated a real vision toward the future. We hope that as this bill moves towards the Senate we will be able to fix some of the inadequacies that currently exist in this bill. I want to thank the gentleman from Texas , the chairman of our subcommittee, for his willingness to work across the aisle and to do the best we could, again with a size eleven foot bill when, in fact, we only have a shoe about size six. We just cannot meet all the needs that are being asked of us. But we have done the best we can. I rise in support of the rule and ask the Members to vote for the rule and ultimately for the bill. I will also say that when the bill comes to the floor for full consideration tomorrow we will be offering amendments in the area of biofuels, trying to help to generate new industry across this country, a renewable fuels industry in ethanol and biodiesel and some of the new alcohol based fuels we have not even invented yet. We will have an amendment on Iraq and will bring to the attention of the country the misuse of the Commodity Credit Corporation back during the 1980s and 1990s which has led us to have to bail out banks in the Middle East as a result of what was done back then and potentially what could happen again by what is being proposed in this bill now. We will have an amendment dealing with outsourcing of call centers by the Food Stamp Program, trying to bring those call centers back to the United States, to our own people who need work. Finally, we may have amendments dealing with the reimportation of prescription drugs, and we want to keep the base amendment that we were able to insert at the subcommittee level, which is to allow the reimportation of drugs from nations like Canada so that our people can buy them at affordable prices. We want to be able to keep that in the bill. We will have an amendment on the Farmers Market Promotion Program, trying to bring it to a level where it can serve a majority of our people. So, again, I ask for the support of the membership on the rule, and I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.","word.count":1074,"sep11":2.90730337078652,"years":2004.76685393258,"days":3477,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.620800483366122,"Topic 2":0.228242546321474,"Topic 3":0.0228096244881899,"Topic 4":0.0410483851709032,"Topic 5":0.0115006118912143,"Topic 6":0.0133422383619911,"Topic 7":0.0313848232006105,"Topic 8":0.0137045163954113,"Topic 9":0.0129019522699278,"Topic 10":0.0042648185341555},{"id":"10419960076167","body":"Pete Domenici: Before the Senator arrived we spoke of stagnant family income.

This same coalition is involved with making some of the finest combat knives in the world; laser sights, laser devices that can help protect aviation or even possibly one day shoot down missiles; adhesive armor, to up-armor Humvees in 4 hours to save our soldiers' lives. The gentleman from Arizona said we don't pick winners and losers. In fact, we do. If you vote against this provision and for your amendment, you will pick our soldiers as losers. This is about providing resources to help small businesses and medium-sized businesses get state-of-the- art equipment to our soldiers. I don't know if you have had the occasion to meet with a midsized growing business that makes this kind of equipment, but talking to them and the challenges they face in working with defense procurement proposals, defense procurement procedures and other needs are very difficult challenges. I think it is entirely appropriate that the Federal Government participate in this, along with the match that was described earlier, because this is a program that could well be a model for the country, that will produce more effective business results and better products for our soldiers. One final statement I would just make: We talk in this body a lot about dynamic scoring of tax cuts. There is also dynamic scoring of expenditures. I would submit to the gentleman from Arizona and to all my colleagues that for a small amount of money, we are going to stimulate manufacturing of state-of-the-art devices and equipment that will save our soldiers' lives and save this government money over the long run. This is a good proposal, an innovative proposal, and good products that will save the lives of our soldiers will result from it.

I am a bit breathless because I hustled over here to arrive at the appointed time; and I thank my colleagues, hopefully, they filibustered a few minutes on my behalf as good friends likely would. Mr. Speaker, I would like to speak to you about a few issues about border control especially on the southern border and primarily on the southern border. I have long spoken about the policy that I think we need to have with regard to the immigration policy across the Nation, about domestic enforcement and shutting off the jobs magnet, and also about the need to stop the bleeding at our southern border. And so I had gone down to the border about a year ago and spent a long weekend down there, at least 3 days on the ground and in the air, as a guest of the Border Patrol and some of the other agencies that operate the security along the border. And I was given a very good tour and a few rides in helicopters at night and also in the daytime, shining the night sun down along our border to identify where there might be illegals that have come across or future illegals preparing to come across. And I stopped and visited some of the stations and their equipment and talked to the men. I was impressed with the quality of the team people that they had assembled, the equipment they had assembled, and the tactics they had. Yet in that full long weekend, I did not actually see activity which would indicate to a reasonable person that there was not activity to be seen. In spite all of those hours in the air and the hours on the ground and the night vision equipment, I did not again see any illegal activities, although I got many reports of the success of the interdiction of our border patrol and our other agencies. Well, as I listen to the debate here in the House of Representatives, Mr. Speaker, and the testimony that comes before the immigration subcommittee which I sit upon, and I sit in those hearings two, three, even four times a week and we will have four, sometimes eight witnesses giving us credible data and good well-informed information on this issue from both sides of the issue, Mr. Speaker, and always the years, the cumulative information has built in me after those years of sitting on the immigration subcommittee, I began to think that I have a pretty decent broad background on the subject. And yet there was a gap, Mr. Speaker, there was a gap in that subject because I had not gone down and spent time on the border more or less unguided, more or less outside the scope of the Border Patrol, but gone ahead and gone down to the border and looked under all the stones and met with the people that were actually more likely to be more frank with me. So that was my mission this past weekend where I spent perhaps as much as 4 days on the ground in Arizona. And the goal was to meet with the people that are enforcing our laws down there, the ones that are out in the night and those people who have seen this bleeding, this hemorrhaging at our border firsthand, that can describe to me the scope of the bleeding in our southern border. Mr. Speaker, I am here to say tonight that it is astonishing. It is far worse than I had imagined and my imagination was fairly strong. My predictions and the numbers that I put out were fairly aggressive, at least viewed by some of my critics. But there is nothing I saw down on the border over the weekend, Mr. Speaker, that would cause me to believe that I have overstated the numbers of people who are illegally crossing our border or the amount of drugs, illegal drugs, that are coming across our border, or the amount of violence that is visited because of the drug problem both south of the border, north of the border, and the violence that goes throughout the drug culture in America and the collateral damage to the victims that may not be associate with that at all, but happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and are victims of murder, victims of negligent homicide generally in the form of a car accident where the driver who was at fault was under the influence of alcohol or drugs. So what I did, Mr. Speaker, was go down to visit in a region, starting out on Friday, in a region south of Tucson, south and a little bit east of Tucson. I first met with a special agent who briefed me on a lot of information that had been coming by this individual on a consistent basis. And then I went to Bisbee, Arizona, where I went on down then to the border there to Naco, Arizona, right on the border with Mexico. That is a location that has seen a fair amount of violence and a lot of concentration of illegal traffic going along the border. They finally decided to establish and build a fence, Mr. Speaker. I was guided to that location by a retired Border Patrol officer and a rancher from that region, both with a passion of patriotism for America, both that have a memory of growing up in an America and that part of Arizona that was a different kind of country than it is today. It was then a place that they could feel safe in their streets and safe in their homes and walk the streets and not lock their homes. And today that region has been flooded with just thousands and tens of thousands and perhaps hundreds of thousands of illegals, many of them carrying illegal drugs through that region. And cars drive across the border where sometimes there had been an existing fence that was built originally to contain livestock, that fence has essentially been systematically broken down, and vehicles with drugs and illegals in them would drive right through the gaps in the fence, sometimes drive through the fence, and take off across the desert or cut across over to a highway and get up on the highway. And once they were on the highway, for a little ways they were gone, they were free, they were in America, not ever to be captured again, not ever to be accountable again unless they were just simply victims of bad luck. They realized the magnitude of this problem at Naco, Arizona, and went in and built a fence through there, Mr. Speaker. It is built out of interlocking steel that sometimes can be 10 feet high or higher and then above that in some cases they have welded a kind of wire mesh that goes up another 4 to 6 feet. And when they originally built the fence, people said it would not work. It cannot work. People will go over it. They will go through. They will go under it, or they will go around it. In fact, they do go around it, Mr. Speaker. At one point they picked up a cutting torch and cut a hole through it and made their own gate in that solid steel fence, and that was a pathway by which people and drugs traveled into the United States, and some went back through that gate. And the patrol went there and welded the gate shut, and as they kept some maintenance up on the fence, the other side essentially gave up on trying to breech the fence. Now, the illegal traffic goes around the end as one reason, rather than trying to find a way through a barrier that is a good solid barrier that has been very, very effective. The Border Patrol officer whom I was there with and the rancher whom I was there with said look at this, and they described the problem they used to have about the thousands of people pouring across there. They said: We do not have that problem anymore. This community is safer than it was. It is more secure than it was. There is far less illegal traffic going through here. There is far less crime of all kinds, far less violence, and far fewer illegal drugs in this community because we built a barrier that kept the elements out that were eroding our quality of life in Naco, Arizona. That was an interesting trip, and they took me out along the border where that fence essentially stops and diminishes in some locations. There is nothing there, not even a way to define where the border is between the United States and Mexico, but simply open places where illegals can walk across the border and one location just in a dry river bed or they would not be seen by night vision. They were protected by the shrubbery and vegetation. They could simply walk down from Mexico into the United States unimpeded, unobstructed, unobserved and become shadow people here in the United States doing whatever they do. They were strong advocates of the border barrier and one that is solidly built and one that can be efficient and is becoming a tool that could very much support our law enforcement and let them focus their energy on plans that could be more effective than riding herd on a broad length of an unprotected border. It is ridiculous to think that we could ever hire enough people to sit along the border, especially at night, and watch people come across and then catch them rather than put in a fence that would not allow them to come across in the first place. That was Naco, Arizona, and again, I learned a lot about the culture and the level of corruption on the south side of the border. It was an interesting conversation. From there, I went down then to the reservation and was a guest of a number of the Shadow Wolves who are part of the Customs and Border Patrol. Actually, today, they are a part of the Border Patrol. They have been shifted to that, but it is on the Tohono O'odham Reservation, and on the reservation the Native Americans control that land. They have support of the Border Patrol, but they have had an organization there called the Shadow Wolves. They are Federal employees and their responsibility is to guard the border and interdict illegal drugs and illegal aliens. They are focusing on illegal drugs. Their peak recruitment, the top numbers there, Mr. Speaker; were 22, and when they were 22 strong, in fact, that does not sound like a very large group given the size of the reservation and given the miles of border that they have to protect,","word.count":8470,"sep11":4.77808988764045,"years":2006.63764044944,"days":4143,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.886883901119643,"Topic 2":0.036723135312318,"Topic 3":0.00808125932324659,"Topic 4":0.0196394581575493,"Topic 5":0.00799578498922116,"Topic 6":0.00851773840955409,"Topic 7":0.00624315660985524,"Topic 8":0.0143926544219609,"Topic 9":0.00804402290837775,"Topic 10":0.00347888874827397},{"id":"11020080024771","body":"Louie Gohmert: Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 369. This concurrent resolution does honor the men and women of the Drug Enforcement Administration on the occasion of its 35th anniversary. The Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, was created by President Nixon in July 1973. The DEA was established to create a single unified command to conduct ``an all-out global war on the drug menace.'' The DEA has the core mission to enforce U.S. controlled substances laws that regulate drugs such as marijuana, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, Ecstasy and controlled prescription drugs. Initially, the DEA had 1,470 special agents and a budget of less than $75 million. Its foreign presence consisted of 43 foreign offices in 31 countries. Since that time the DEA has grown substantially and is now 5,235 special agents, a budget of more than $2.3 billion, and 87 foreign offices in 63 countries. I have personally seen them at work, both here and abroad, and know that the DEA agents are on the front lines of our war on drugs. They are courageous individuals, and they are to be honored and commended. DEA special agents work to track and identify the individuals and organized crime syndicates that grow, manufacture and traffic drugs into the U.S. To accomplish that mission, the DEA manages a national drug intelligence program by cooperating with Federal, State, local and foreign officials to collect, analyze and disseminate strategic and operational drug intelligence information. The DEA and its multi- jurisdictional partners form task forces that use this intelligence to plan highly successful operations. In May, a DEA-led task force completed an investigation called ``Operation Sudden Fall'' in San Diego. This investigation resulted in the arrest of 96 individuals, including 75 San Diego State University students who were involved with the trafficking of cocaine, marijuana and Ecstasy on the university's campus. As the plague of drugs has become more pervasive, the DEA has also increased its international efforts to combat drug trafficking abroad. The DEA coordinates with the United Nations, Interpol and foreign governments to develop programs designed to reduce the availability of illicit drugs in the United States such as crop eradication, crop substitution and training of foreign officials. These international efforts bring significant results. Recently, Colombia extradited 14 members of a paramilitary and drug trafficking group to the United States to face charges of drug trafficking, support to a terrorist organization, and money laundering. In June, the DEA worked with partners in Afghanistan to conduct Operation Albatross. This effort resulted in the seizure of 262 tons of hashish, the largest of any known drug seizure in history. As H. Con. Res. 369 notes, in this decade alone, DEA agents have seized over 5,500 kilograms of heroin, 650,000 kilograms of cocaine, 2.3 million kilograms of marijuana, 13,000 kilograms of methamphetamine, almost 80 million dosage units of hallucinogens, and made over 240,000 arrests. This is a tremendous amount of poison that they have prevented from entering our fellow citizens. In supporting this resolution, I join my colleagues in, one, congratulating the DEA on the occasion of its 35th anniversary; two, honoring the heroic sacrifice of the agency's employees who have given their lives or have been wounded or injured in service of our Nation; and three, giving heartfelt thanks to all of the men and women of the DEA for their past and continued efforts to defend the American people from the scourge of illegal drugs and terrorism. With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.","word.count":593,"sep11":7.01685393258427,"years":2008.87640449438,"days":4940,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.182043833630762,"Topic 2":0.207287913552025,"Topic 3":0.0169633701468166,"Topic 4":0.0141920907240035,"Topic 5":0.0439711264742885,"Topic 6":0.514788890395081,"Topic 7":0.00548600260919121,"Topic 8":0.00912205445236064,"Topic 9":0.0038551762706291,"Topic 10":0.00228954174484255},{"id":"10519970001810","body":"Joe Scarborough: Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York , a former member of the Committee on Agriculture, now on the powerful Committee on Appropriations.","word.count":173,"sep11":-4.65449438202247,"years":1997.20505617978,"days":785,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.949707800766521,"Topic 2":0.0183399961629088,"Topic 3":0.00316702497630391,"Topic 4":0.00892682049429087,"Topic 5":0.00330463890108092,"Topic 6":0.00361390947017006,"Topic 7":0.0026851605293625,"Topic 8":0.00555564019966341,"Topic 9":0.00335463221570904,"Topic 10":0.0013443762839889},{"id":"10920060019590","body":"Jim McDermott: Madam Speaker, on Sunday, Iraq's prime minister unveiled a 24-point plan that included a timetable for U.S. withdrawal. Last week, the U.S. military's top commander in Iraq briefed the President and top Republicans about a plan to significantly reduce the number of U.S. soldiers in Iraq. For months, Democrats have been calling for a new direction, including a timetable to redeploy U.S. soldiers out of harm's way; and the American people have been saying it is time for a new direction that protects U.S. interests by protecting U.S. soldiers. The Iraqi people, the American people and the U.S. commanders all say the same thing: It is time for a timetable. And the President still says the same thing: Stay the course. Madam Speaker, the Democrats were wrong. The President's favorite phrase, stay the course, is not a slogan. It is a direct order for Republican Members of the Congress to deny their better judgment and disregard the concern of their American constituents and the top five military commanders. The President must have some kind of October surprise in mind. The President is off course, and until there is a mid-term course correction, America will remain misled and misguided in Iraq, and U.S. soldiers will bear the brunt of the President's stubbornness.","word.count":211,"sep11":4.91573033707865,"years":2006.77528089888,"days":4192,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0730561628829913,"Topic 2":0.333085470321769,"Topic 3":0.161347916828493,"Topic 4":0.049741637619636,"Topic 5":0.00889941378506568,"Topic 6":0.00867240790526504,"Topic 7":0.258744675570471,"Topic 8":0.00915011758057235,"Topic 9":0.0929549375218044,"Topic 10":0.00434725998393236},{"id":"10419960063139","body":"Robert Byrd: Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Appalachian Development Highway System Completion Act of 1997. This bill will ensure that adequate funds will be disbursed to complete the Appalachian Development Highway System by the year 2003, some 38 years after the Federal Government first committed itself to the completion of this critical highway network. We are quickly approaching the expiration of the funding authorizations contained in the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, or ISTEA as it is commonly referred to. Our colleagues in the other body have already begun hearings on the reauthorization of ISTEA, and the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee will begin efforts toward that end in the next several months. As we approach the drafting of a new comprehensive multiyear highway bill, I want to call the attention of my Senate colleagues to the proposal to ensure that the Federal Government finally fulfills its commitment to providing adequate highway access throughout the Appalachian region. The necessity to expand highway access to spur the development of the Appalachian region was first cited by the President's Appalachian Regional Commission of 1964, 32 years ago. The commission's report stated: One year later, the Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965 authorized several programs for the development of the region, the first of which called for the construction of a new highway network. According to the act, these highways ``will open up an area or areas with a developmental potential where commerce and communication have been inhibited by lack of adequate access.'' Mr. President, subsequent amendments to the act defined the 3,025 miles that comprise the Appalachian Development Highway System. Unfortunately, today we find that while the Interstate Highway System is virtually 100 percent complete, the Appalachian Development Highway System is only 76 percent complete. Of the 3,025 miles that comprise the Appalachian system, roughly 725 miles remain unfinished more than 30 years after the system was promised. These unfinished miles, spread throughout the 13 States that have counties within the statutorily designated boundaries of Appalachia, await completion. Those States include Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. All of West Virginia is within Appalachia. West Virginia is the only State that is wholly within Appalachia. While the completion of the Interstate Highway System did play a role in the development of certain parts of Appalachia, the interstate system largely bypassed the Appalachian region due to the extremely high costs associated with building roads through Appalachia's rugged topography. As a result, the construction of the interstates had the detrimental effect of drawing passengers and freight, and their accompanying economic benefits, away from the Appalachian region. This left the Appalachian region with a transportation infrastructure of dangerous, narrow, winding roads that followed the paths of river valleys and streambeds between mountains. These roads are, more often than not, two-lane roads that are required to be squeezed into very limited rights-of-way. They are characterized by low travel speeds and long travel distances due to the winding roadway pattern. They were often built to inadequate design standards and, therefore, present very hazardous driving conditions. For those areas where the Appalachian Development Highway System has been completed, we have seen stunning economic successes. The Appalachian Regional Commission has completed surveys indicating that of the hundreds of thousands of jobs that have been created in the Appalachian region over recent decades, over 80 percent of these jobs have been located along either the Appalachian highway system or the Interstate Highway System. We have seen this in West Virginia as we have seen it in each of the other 12 States that comprise the Appalachian region. Unfortunately, we have also seen that in those areas where the Appalachian Development Highway System has not been completed, it is almost impossible for communities to compete for large employers due to poor access to national markets. Mr. President, the rationale behind the completion of the Appalachian highway system is no less sound today than it was 32 years ago--in 1964. Unfortunately, there are still children in Appalachia who lack decent transportation routes to schools. There are still pregnant women, elderly citizens, and others who lack timely road access to area hospitals. There are thousands of people who certainly find it very difficult to obtain sustainable, well-paying jobs because of poor road access to the major employment centers. Mr. President, the people of Appalachia have waited long enough for the Federal Government to fulfill its commitment to the Appalachian region. The bill I am introducing today will ensure that sufficient funds are set aside in the next major highway bill to complete the remaining 24 percent of the Appalachian Development Highway System. This bill takes a different approach from that of the prior authorization acts for the Appalachian highway system. The bill calls for direct contract authority to be made available from the highway trust fund to be distributed to the States of the Appalachian region solely for the purpose of completing the 725 unfinished miles of the Appalachian Development Highway System. One of the primary reasons why completion of the Appalachian highway system has lagged behind that of the Interstate Highway System is because the interstate system has benefited from the direct availability of highway trust funds, while the Appalachian Development Highway System has been required to be financed largely through incremental annual appropriations of general funds. Now, Mr. President, the Appalachian Development Highway System is no less deserving of highway trust funds than any other major arterial road system. The 725 miles of the Appalachian Development Highway System that await completion represent just 1.6 percent of the size of our completed Interstate Highway System. They represent less than one- half of 1 percent of the size of the National Highway System, just designated in law in 1995. It is certainly high time that the funding mechanism for the Appalachian Development Highway System be put on a par with those of other highway systems of national significance that are customarily funded through direct contract authority from the trust fund. The bill I introduce today also makes clear that funds provided to the Appalachian States for the completion of the Appalachian Development Highway System will be provided in addition to the funds that those States will receive from the Federal aid highway program for their customary purposes. These States should not be required to choose between the maintenance of their interstate and other Federal highways and the completion of the Appalachian system. It would not be fair to the States of the Appalachian region to give with the one hand and take away with the other. Under this bill, States will still be required to provide the standard 20 percent matching share for Federal funds for the completion of these highways, as is the case for all major Federal aid highway programs. The bill authorizes the Secretary to distribute such sums as are necessary for the completion of the Appalachian Development Highway System. The Appalachian Regional Commission, with the cooperation of the Federal Highway Administration, is currently updating its estimate for the cost to complete the system. I anticipate that when this bill is incorporated into next year's highway legislation, it will identify and authorize the appropriate dollar figure that results from this ongoing study. I should point out, Mr. President, that the administration shares my goal for the completion of the Appalachian Development Highway System in the near term. I recently wrote to the President regarding my concern in this area. OMB Director, Alice Rivlin, responding for the President, stated that it is the administration's goal to complete the construction of the system by the year 2005. In response to my questions during a recent Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee hearing, Secretary Pena also signaled his support and cooperation. Therefore, I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation. Our entire Nation has benefited from the improvements brought about by the Appalachian Development Highway System and so, too, will we all benefit from its completion in the near future. S. 1882. A bill to amend chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code, to include medical foods as a specific item for which coverage may be provided under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs. &lt;bullet&gt; Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I introduce legislation that will clarify the ability of fee-for-service plans in the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program [FEHBP] to provide coverage for medical foods. Medical foods are a liquid formula given to a patient under the supervision of a doctor in cases where patients cannot take solid foods to meet their nutritional needs. Medical foods are often used for patients with AIDS or patients undergoing chemotherapy and have difficulty taking solid foods. So this bill would amend title 5 of the United States Code to include medical foods specifically in the list of items and services that can be covered by fee-for-service plans serving FEHBP beneficiaries. This legislation would not mandate coverage of medical foods. It simply clarifies that fee-for-service plans can provide coverage for medical foods.&lt;bullet&gt;","word.count":1514,"sep11":-5.36797752808989,"years":1996.49157303371,"days":531,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.11452950091625,"Topic 2":0.0682271956858859,"Topic 3":0.271057354165918,"Topic 4":0.00613835610553251,"Topic 5":0.00692730924388896,"Topic 6":0.294082379484781,"Topic 7":0.126440092205653,"Topic 8":0.0861946219865077,"Topic 9":0.0195547213825923,"Topic 10":0.006848468822991},{"id":"10920060038367","body":"Edward Kennedy: Mr. President, for months, we have been ready to roll up our sleeves and get back to work on the PATRIOT Act, but the White House has continued to block bipartisan efforts to improve the original bill and accept oversight of its intrusive surveillance programs. Again, and again, the administration has refused to join in serious negotiations with Republicans and Democrats on matters of national security, including the National Security Agency's warrantless wiretaps and the FBI's use of national security letters. The latest proposal offers improvements and deserves to pass; however, it is unacceptable and undemocratic that further amendments could not even be considered. We need to implement these improvements quickly given the administration's disregard of congressional oversight. The proposed reauthorization bill requires public reports on the use of two of the most controversial provisions: section 215 and national security letters. It also requires the inspector general to audit their use, and it mandates a report on any data-mining activities by the Justice Department. Americans deserve national security laws that protect both our security and our constitutional rights, and more changes are clearly needed. One of the most glaring omissions in the proposal is the failure to include a 4-year sunset provision on national security letters, even though it would be consistent with the new reporting and auditing requirements that will take effect. The latest changes provide some additional protection for libraries, but these safeguards should apply to all of the means used by the Government to obtain sensitive information, including financial documents and library records. We also need a report on the Government's use of computerized searches from all Federal agencies, and we will continue to seek such a requirement as part of efforts toward other reforms. We have not yet achieved the 9/11 Commission's goal to maintain governmental powers that enhance our national security while ensuring adequate oversight over their use. With so much at stake, the administration's refusal to work with Congress can only weaken our national security and further undermine the public's trust in their Government. So this battle will go on, and I regret we could not accomplish more in this needed legislation.","word.count":358,"sep11":4.58707865168539,"years":2006.44662921348,"days":4075,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.203813548869973,"Topic 2":0.0277705492721289,"Topic 3":0.0935894842915097,"Topic 4":0.0149022636745355,"Topic 5":0.00866037783059569,"Topic 6":0.485087473690452,"Topic 7":0.00740400467817339,"Topic 8":0.0698651658718052,"Topic 9":0.0156139420174075,"Topic 10":0.0732931898034198},{"id":"10720020054123","body":"Patrick Leahy: Mr. President, with today's vote, the Senate will confirm the 12th judge to our Federal courts of appeals and our 61st judicial nominee since the change in Senate majority last summer. In little more than 1 year, the Senate Judiciary Committee has already voted on 75 of this President's judicial nominees, including 15 nominees to the courts of appeals. This is more circuit and district court nominees than in any of the previous 6\\1/2\\ years of Republican control. In fact, we have given votes to more judicial nominees than in 1996 and 1997 combined, as well as in 1999 and 2000 combined. Despite the partisan din about blockades and stalls and inaction as well as absurd claims that judicial nominees are being held ``hostage''--the fact is that since the change in majority last summer the Senate, and in particular the Judiciary Committee, has been working at a much faster rate than in the 6\\1/2\\ years of Republican control. With respect to courts of appeals nominees, we confirmed the first of President Bush's nominees last July 20 and today we confirm the 12th. That is a confirmation rate of approximately one circuit court nominee confirmed per month. By contrast, in the 76 months in which Republicans were in charge, only 46 courts of appeals judges were confirmed, at a rate closer to one every two months. Thus, despite the additional obstacles and roadblocks that the partisan practices of the new administration have created and the partisan rhetoric of our critics, we are actually achieving almost twice as much as our Republican counterparts did. With a little cooperation from the administration and the nomination of more moderate, mainstream candidates, we would be even further along. During the 76 months under the Republican control before the Judiciary Committee was allowed to reorganize, vacancies on the Federal courts rose from 63 to 110. Vacancies on the Courts of Appeals more than doubled from 16 to 33. That is the situation created by Republican inaction and that is the situation we inherited. Since the change in majority, confirmations have gone up and vacancies have been going down. Courts of Appeals vacancies are being decreased rather than continuing to increase, despite the high level of attrition since the shift in Senate majority last summer. Indeed, in the last year the Judiciary Committee held the first hearing on a Fifth Circuit nominee in 7 years, the first hearing on a Tenth Circuit nominee in 6 years, the first hearing on a Sixth Circuit nominee in almost 5 years, the first hearing on a Fourth Circuit nominee in 3 years, the first hearing on a Ninth Circuit nominee in 2 years. This week we held hearings on a third nominee to the Fifth Circuit in less than a year. This contrasts with the lack of any confirmation hearing on any of President Clinton's nominees to the Fifth Circuit in the last 5\\1/2\\ years of Republican control of the confirmation process, despite three qualified nominees to vacancies there. The nominee being considered today is the first nominee to the Sixth Circuit to be given a vote by the Senate since 1997. After that, the Republican majority locked the gates and despite a number of well-qualified nominees sent to the Senate by President Clinton between 1995 and 2001, none were allowed to receive a hearing or a vote for all of 1998, 1999, 2000 and the first 3 months of 2001. Most of the vacancies that exist on the Sixth Circuit arose during the Clinton administration and before the change in majority last summer. Yet not one of the Clinton nominees to those current vacancies on the Sixth Circuit received a hearing by the Judiciary Committee under Republican leadership. The Sixth Circuit vacancies are a prime and unfortunate legacy of the past partisan obstructionist practices under Republican leadership and one of a number of examples of circuits in which the vacancies were preserved rather than filled by the former Republican majority in the Senate. That is what created the problem that we are now trying to correct. Vacancies on the Sixth Circuit were perpetuated during the last several years of the Clinton administration when the Republican majority refused to hold hearings on the nominations of Judge Helene White, Kathleen McCree Lewis, and Professor Kent Markus to those vacancies in the Sixth Circuit. One of those seats has been vacant since 1995, the first term of President Clinton. Judge Helene White of the Michigan Courts of appeals was nominated in January 1997 and did not receive a hearing on her nomination during the more than 1,500 days before her nomination was withdrawn by President Bush in March of last year. Judge White's nomination may have set one or a number of unfortunate records for obstruction established during the years 1996-2001. Her nomination was pending without a hearing before this committee for over 4 years 51 months. She was first nominated in January 1997 and renominated and renominated through March of last year when President Bush chose to withdraw her nomination. This was at a time when the committee averaged hearings on only nine courts of appeals nominees a year and, in 2000, held only five hearings on courts of appeals nominees all year. In contrast, Judge Gibbons was the 11th courts of appeals nominees voted on by the committee during the first 10 months of a Democratic majority. As of today, the Democratic-led Judiciary Committee has held hearings for 17 of President Bush's courts of appeals nominees in less than 13 months, and we will hold our 18th hearing for a courts of appeals nominee this week. Kathleen McCree Lewis, a distinguished lawyer from a prestigious Michigan law firm, also did not receive a hearing on her 1999 nomination to the Sixth Circuit during the years it was pending before it was withdrawn by President Bush in March 2001. She is the daughter of Wade McCree, a former Solicitor General of the United States and former Sixth Circuit judge. Professor Kent Markus, another outstanding nominee to a vacancy on the Sixth Circuit that arose in 1999, never received a hearing on his nomination before his nomination was returned to President Clinton without action in December 2000. While Professor Markus' nomination was pending, his confirmation was supported by individuals of every political stripe, including: 14 past presidents of the Ohio State Bar Association; more than 80 Ohio law school deans and professors; prominent Ohio Republicans, including Ohio Supreme Court Chief Justice Thomas Moyer, Ohio Supreme Court Justice Evelyn Stratton, Congresswoman Deborah Pryce, and Congressman David Hobson; the National District Attorneys Association; and virtually every major newspaper in the State. Professor Markus summarized his experience as a Federal judicial nominee in testimony this May in a hearing before Senator Schumer. Here are some of things he said: As Professor Markus identified, some on the other side of the aisle held these seats open for years for another President to fill, instead of proceeding fairly on the consensus nominees pending before the Senate. Republicans were unwilling to move forward, even knowing that retirements and attrition would create four additional seats that would arise naturally for the next President. That is why there are now eight vacancies on the Sixth Circuit and why it is half empty. Long before some of the recent voices of concern were raised about the vacancies on that court, Democratic Senators in 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000 implored the Republican majority to give the Sixth Circuit nominees hearings. Those requests, made not just for the sake of the nominees but for the sake of the public's business before the court, were ignored. Numerous articles and editorials urged the Republican leadership to act on those nominations, to no avail. Fourteen former presidents of the Michigan State Bar pleaded for hearings on those nominations. The former chief judge of the Sixth Circuit, Judge Gilbert Merritt, wrote to the Judiciary Committee chairman years ago to ask that the nominees get hearings and that the vacancies be filled. The chief judge noted that, with four vacancies--the four vacancies that arose in the Clinton administration--the Sixth Circuit ``is hurting badly and will not be able to keep up with its work load due to the fact that the Senate Judiciary Committee has acted on none of the nominations to our Court.'' He predicted: ``By the time the next President is inaugurated, there will be 6 vacancies on the Courts of appeals. Almost half of the Court will be vacant and will remain so for most of 2001 due to the exigencies of the nomination process. Although the President has nominated candidates, the Senate has refused to take a vote on any of them.'' Nonetheless, no Sixth Circuit hearings were held in the last 3 years of the Clinton administration, despite these pleas. Not one. Since the shift in majority last summer, the situation has been exacerbated further as two additional vacancies have arisen. The committee's April 25th hearing on the nomination of Judge Gibbons to the Sixth Circuit was the first hearing on a Sixth Circuit nomination in almost 5 years, even though three outstanding, fair- minded individuals were nominated to the Sixth Circuit by President Clinton and were pending before the committee for anywhere from 1 year to over 4 years. We have not stopped there but have proceeded to hold a hearing on a second Sixth Circuit nominee, Professor John Rogers of Kentucky, and the Judiciary Committee has acted on that nomination, as well. Large numbers of vacancies continue to exist on many courts of appeals, in large measure because the recent Republican majority was not willing to hold hearings or vote on more than half--56 percent--of President Clinton's courts of appeals nominees in 1999 and 2000 and was not willing to confirm a single judge to the courts of appeals during the entire 1996 session.

Given the volatility of the situation in the Middle East in the midst of America's war on terrorism, it is vital that Congress and the Administration present a united foreign policy front to the rest of the world. For that reason, I will vote for the FY 2002 Foreign Operations conference report, I do so reluctantly and with reservation--and I do not often vote for Foreign Operations appropriations bills. I believe it is time--I believe it is past time--to rethink our foreign aid policy and how relates to our national security priorities. September 11 was a wake up call on many fronts. As a result of the attack on America, we have made sweeping changes in our concept of national security. We have learned that national security also means homeland defense. We have learned that airplanes can be bombs and that letters in the mail can be lethal. We have learned that we must change our definition of defense to encompass defending our domestic infrastructure as well as defending against ballistic missile threats. These changes reflect the realization that the September 11 terrorist attacks on U.S. soil may not be an isolated incident. At this moment, there may be people planning other terrorist acts against our homeland. We have already experienced three terrorism alerts in the U.S. since September 11. Almost daily, we hear grim predictions of what the future may bring. We are living in an age of global instability, disenfranchised and desperate peoples, and widespread proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The volatility of the current world situation is without precedent. And yet, in many ways, the major instrument of our foreign policy-- the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act--reflects a distressing attitude of business-as-ususal. I do not fault the authors of this bill. Senator Leahy and Senator McConnell have done an excellent job in balancing the priorities of the Administration with the concerns of Congress and the needs of our allies throughout the world. They have done so with care and skill, and they are to be commended for their work. No, the fault, I believe, lies with our inability as a nation to relinquish long held conventional wisdom about foreign aid and recognize that the changing global environment requires a revamping of our foreign policy. We must move away from using dollars to symbolize the strength of our relations with other countries, and instead focus our energies--and our resources on promoting a new understanding of foreign policy that complements and enhances our global war on terrorism. Nowhere is this more true than in the Middle East, where renewed violence and antipathy have brought Israel and the Palestinian Authority to the brink of open warfare. Since September 29, 2000, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, fueled by generations of hatred, has claimed nearly 1,000 lives. For the past 15 months, the unending cycle of violence has pitted the home-made bombs and deadly suicide missions of the Palestinians against the heavy armor and missile attacks of the Israelis. Many, perhaps most, of the victims have been young people barely on the cusp of adulthood. The sad fact is that the next generation of leaders of the Israelis and the Palestinians are being sacrificed to the blood feud of their elders. The United States, like the rest of the world, has looked on this ceaseless carnage in horror. We have expressed dismay, regret, sorrow, and anger. We have wrung our hands in despair. We have condemned the violence in the strongest terms. But we have not suited our words to any meaningful action. In this bill, our foreign assistance to the Middle East virtually ignores the spiraling violence in the region. This bill provides $5.1 billion dollars in foreign assistance to the Middle East, primarily Israel and Egypt, a level almost identical to last year's funding. It is as if nothing has changed. There are no strings on the money. There is no requirement that the bloodshed abate before the funding is released. There is no motivation for Egypt to step up its effort to mediate between the sides, and there is no incentive whatsoever for Israel and the Palestinians to make meaningful progress toward a peaceful settlement of their differences. In short, we are doing little more than offering a tacit acknowledgment that the United States is powerless to stop the bloodshed. We are sending the wrong signal to the Middle East. By not using our foreign assistance dollars as an instrument to effect change in the Mideast, we are inadvertently helping to fuel the continued cycle of violence. And what has this hands-off policy produced? Empty promises, escalating violence, and the prospect of war instead of peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Now what? Where does the so-called peace process go from here? Can we really expect the Israelis to exercise restraint following the most recent escalation of violence against their citizens? Is there any point in urging Yassar Arafat to seize and punish the terrorists within his control when he is obviously unable to live up to his promises? Is there any hope that the Israelis and Palestinians will be able to re- engage in meaningful discussions in the foreseeable future? In the current poisonous environment, neither side has any incentive to resume peace talks. To give his expressions of dismay any credibility, Mr. Arafat will have to conduct a swift and sweeping crackdown on the leaders of the Palestinian terrorist cells--something he has never been able to accomplish in the past. And even if Mr. Arafat could deliver on his promises, it will take masterful leadership on the part of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to restrain his military options and to place Israel's settlements in disputed areas on the negotiating table--two difficult but necessary prerequisites for peace. The Israelis and the Palestinians, riven by generations of hatred, cannot hope to accomplish these goals on their own. It is time for Egypt--with the assistance of Saudi Arabia and Jordan--to exercise its considerable influence in the region and place long term security interests over short term internal political costs. Such leadership will not be easy. President Mubarak will have to make hard choices and steel himself and his government against the predictable political backlash from the more radical elements of his own country. But President Mubarak's leadership is necessary to temper the emotions of his fellow members of the Arab League. The United States has a similarly difficult task before it. Despite our clear alliance with Israel, the U.S. must regain the role of honest broker. We must stop rewarding the status quo with an uninterrupted flow of foreign aid dollars and instead use foreign assistance as a tool to leverage peace. We are certainly not doing so now. Just a few weeks ago, the State Department confirmed the intended sale of 53 advanced anti-ship missiles to Egypt. Egypt contends that these missiles are needed to protect its borders, but the fact is, these deadly accurate missiles have the range to threaten Israel's ports and shipping. Given the tinderbox that is the Middle East today, why is the United States contemplating sending these weapons into the region at this time? Meanwhile, we routinely sell advanced aircraft and missiles to Israel as part of our foreign assistance package. Some of these U.S.-made high-tech weapons have been used to target and assassinate Palestinian terrorists. Just days ago, we again saw television images of Israeli- operated, American-made jets and helicopters launching missiles at buildings used by the Palestinian Authority. You can be sure those images were seen throughout the Arab world. How can we demand peace on one hand when we are providing instruments of destruction with the other? Israel and the United States are the staunchest of allies. No one should question our support of Israel's right to exist. But support need not translate into enabling. The United States, the Middle East, and the world would be better served if we changed our policy in the Middle East to reflect reality, not rhetoric. The Palestinians must stop the cycle of violence. The Israelis must practice restraint. The United States must back up its words with action. We have a road map to restart the Middle East peace process, the Mitchell Report. This blueprint, drawn up by former Senator George Mitchell and issued last April, is a step-by-step plan to end the violence and resume negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians. The Mitchell Report is often cited as a practical and workable solution. It has strong support in both the Administration and the Congress. But to date, it is doing little more in real terms than gathering dust on a shelf. To date, there has been no incentive on either side to make the hard decisions that are required to actually implement the steps of the Mitchell Report. It is time for the United States to provide some incentive. It is time to try to implement the Mitchell Report. Just as we must hold the Palestinians responsible for increasing the violence, so must we hold the Israelis responsible for the inflammatory expansion of settlements in disputed areas. The Mitchell Report provides a clear and unbiased insight into the realities of the dispute between the Israelis and the Palestinians. It is remarkable in its fairness and even-handedness in holding both sides accountable for their transgressions. Our foreign assistance policy should do no less. I call on the Administration and this body to take a fresh look at how we apply our foreign assistance to the Middle","word.count":2833,"sep11":0.280898876404494,"years":2002.1404494382,"days":2542,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0649469355633617,"Topic 2":0.0392844083997417,"Topic 3":0.00334001694384213,"Topic 4":0.307432664318518,"Topic 5":0.00129448206368732,"Topic 6":0.00257772524180557,"Topic 7":0.545729960390921,"Topic 8":0.00326718599933587,"Topic 9":0.0308572438238223,"Topic 10":0.00126937725496457},{"id":"10720020017444","body":"James McGovern: Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York for yielding me time. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule, in support of the underlying bill; and I wanted to commend the chairman and ranking member of the Subcommittee on the Interior and the Committee on Appropriations for drafting this bipartisan bill. Mr. Speaker, I hope that more funds shall be made available in the future to meet the many critical needs addressed by this bill and to expand programs that benefit our environment and conserve our resources; however, for fiscal year 2003, I believe that this bill has done great service to the country and restored most of the short- sighted cuts recommended in President Bush's original budget proposal. There are just a few areas where slightly more remains to be done, and I strongly urge my colleagues to support the amendment that will be offered by the gentlewoman from New York and the gentleman from Washington to provide an additional $10 million for the National Endowment for the Arts and $5 million for the National Endowment for the Humanities. Mr. Speaker, in 1995 funding for the NEA and NEH was cut by more than 40 percent. Even though $116 million is provided in H.R. 5093 for the NEA, that amount is still $46 million below the 1995 level. NEH funding is similarly inadequate. The Slaughter-Dicks amendment partially restores funding to these two vital programs. The reasons to support and expand these programs are well documented. The NEA provides critical support for arts education, which has been proven to increase skills in math, reading, language development, and writing. Grants provided by the NEA and NEH leverage millions of dollars each year in private support for arts projects all across this country. The NEH has embarked on numerous projects to preserve our Nation's cultural heritage. It is the Nation's largest source of support for research and scholarship in the humanities. According to a recent study by the Georgia Institute for Technology, the arts industry generates millions of jobs and $134 billion in economic activity every year. Let me repeat that figure: $134 billion annually. In Worcester, Massachusetts, the nonprofit arts community generates over $48 million annually. It supports 1,445 full-time jobs and generates over $1 million in local government revenue and over $3 million in State revenue. Over the past 4 years, the Worcester community has benefited from $215,000 in NEA grants. These grants help mount exhibits in the Worcester Art Museum and in the Higgins Armory Museum. They brought arts exhibits to the public schools and school children to the community art centers and museums. Similar grants also supported the Attleboro Art Museum and community arts programs in central Massachusetts. The NEH at the same time helped to protect some of our Nation's most precious documents and historical archives, which are preserved and displayed at the American Antiquarian Society in Worcester. Other NEH grants supported seminars on history and culture for K through 12 school teachers at the University of Massachusetts in Dartmouth and at Holy Cross College in Worcester. These programs enrich our cultural heritage, strengthen our educational programs, stimulate our teachers and our children, and contribute to the economic well-being of our communities. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the Slaughter- Dicks amendment when it is debated later on in the Interior bill, and I urge my colleagues to support the rule.","word.count":571,"sep11":0.865168539325843,"years":2002.72471910112,"days":2750,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0387958804826424,"Topic 2":0.131182241814986,"Topic 3":0.0924541491315314,"Topic 4":0.00985966097360614,"Topic 5":0.0913291948003267,"Topic 6":0.0100370077299704,"Topic 7":0.223863873554599,"Topic 8":0.253382363511231,"Topic 9":0.0752856907603733,"Topic 10":0.0738099372407338},{"id":"10920060000539","body":"Brian Baird: Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of local communities in my State and throughout this country that are fighting a terrible battle against methamphetamine, its production and use.

Let me express my thanks and gratitude to the Senate majority leader, to the Democratic leader, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and to the ranking Democratic member for breaking what looked to be the coming of gridlock on an issue and a problem on which none of us want gridlock, and we should not allow it to exist. I think we have now limited the number of amendments, and we have clearly accepted some across party lines. And we are quite appropriately moving toward doing something to put us squarely against those who would terrorize America. Mr. President, when I came to the Senate, I got interested in this threat of terrorism because it seemed to me, particularly after the cold war ended, that we in America might surprisingly find our security threatened more directly, our lives threatened more directly by terrorists than we had enduring the long years of the cold war by a heavily armed enemy. The reason is that there are extremist movements throughout the world. There are, sadly, extremist movements within our own country who practice acts of terrorism either to carry out a political purpose or to create panic and insecurity and chaos in our society. I thought we ought to begin to act and do something about that. We conducted hearings and we visited with experts. Mr. President, these inquiries into the problem of terrorism led me to this sad conclusion, which is that it is very difficult to defend against terrorists in a way that gives absolute security in the sense that they, by their nature, as we have seen in our time, will strike at undefended targets. In the aftermath of the events in Oklahoma City, we might increase security at Federal and public buildings, and one could imagine that we can surround every public building in America with security guards, and yet the terrorist bent on destruction and chaos will tragically go down the street and strike at a public building or an office building or a place where people gather. So it seems to me that the best defense against terrorism, international and domestic, is an offense. And the offense is to be prepared, to keep an eye and an ear out for those who would commit terrorist acts. None of us wants to stop people from saying what they believe in this great democracy and writing and demonstrating what they believe. But when some group has indicated or given reason to law enforcement authorities to believe that they are capable of, or are planning or considering a criminal act, I want our Government to be there. I want our Government to be listening. I want our Government to have undercover agents there so that we can [[Page S7756]] strike to stop those terrorist acts, those violent acts, such as the awful assault in Oklahoma City, before they occur.

I would like to thank my colleagues, Senators Wyden and Burns, for their leadership in tackling this problem which affects so many consumers in my State of Washington. Unsolicited commercial email or ``spam'' is a major irritant to consumers and businesses alike. Spam exposes computer users--often young children--to pornography, sexual predators, fraudulent schemes, and other unwanted or harmful messages. In addition, spam costs American business close to $10 billion each year in lost productivity, additional infrastructure costs, and legal fees--costs that are ultimately borne by consumers. By clogging our computers, spam threatens to deprive us of the tremendous benefits provided by the Internet. This bill represents a crucial first step in combating the exponential increase in the volume of spam, which today accounts for half of all email messages. Because of the global nature of this problem and the anonymity that the Internet affords spammers, it is impossible for states or individuals alone to take meaningful steps to reduce the impact of this nuisance, and self-regulation is simply not an option. The overwhelming volume of sleazy and fraudulent solicitations originating from criminal organizations demands a tough response that imposes both civil and criminal penalties. That is precisely why this bill is so necessary. To protect computer users in my State and across the country, we must take immediate steps to stem the mountain of spam hitting email inboxes every day. The Burns-Wyden bill is a long-awaited step in the right direction. The bill has been carefully negotiated and improved. By allowing enforcement by State attorneys general and by Internet service providers, we have increased the odds of successful enforcement against the worst spammers. By prohibiting harvesting of email addresses, the use of technology to send thousands of spammed messages, and by prohibiting false and misleading message headers, the bill will send a clear message to the most abusive spammers that their practices will no longer be tolerated. But enforcement will remain a challenge. Spammers have every incentive to increase the volume of their messages because the marginal cost of sending another message is virtually nothing. And because of the anonymity and global nature of the internet, spammers can hide their identity and move their operations offshore. While the bill before us will finally put in place a Federal approach to the global problem of spam, there is no single solution to this complex problem. I am pleased that the bill will require the Federal Trade Commission to develop legislation to establish a national Do Not Email registry modeled on the Do Not Call registry, but I believe there may come a point at which additional protections are necessary to protect consumers and to protect the growth of the information economy. I think we all recognize that we have much more work to do to solve this problem, but the Burns-Wyden bill is an excellent first step in addressing the problem, and I am pleased to help pass this important legislation.","word.count":520,"sep11":2.16573033707865,"years":2004.02528089888,"days":3213,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0994904956828969,"Topic 2":0.423800785462293,"Topic 3":0.154271974608865,"Topic 4":0.138786419848546,"Topic 5":0.0104447095471985,"Topic 6":0.145685561027377,"Topic 7":0.00572702713525884,"Topic 8":0.0129324403600288,"Topic 9":0.00634564865881217,"Topic 10":0.00251493766872321},{"id":"10419960036839","body":"Speaker: 1.

As I understand the point he makes, it is that we should not create a situation where a shipbuilder can both get disaster funds from the Federal Government and insurance benefits from hurricane coverage and, thereby, be unjustly enriched by getting money from two different sources for one disaster. The language of the general provision, which the Senator purports to amend with this amendment, prevents a shipbuilder from getting double payment, in effect. The Senator's amendment strikes the provision and the language in the provision which guarantees that. I think there is no disagreement between us as to what the outcome ought to be. What we are trying to do is reduce costs to the U.S. Navy and, thereby, to the U.S. taxpayers for future shipbuilding activity by reimbursing the shipbuilder for damages caused by the hurricane, purely and simply. There is no effort to prevent the shipbuilder from recovering what it is entitled to recover from the insurance companies that had coverage in this situation. But the fact is, you could not get insurance coverage for all of the damages done by the hurricane, only some. The policy defines the obligation. The contract, in effect, between the shipbuilder and the insurance company defines what benefits the shipbuilders are entitled to receive. And these contracts are being honored, some maybe not as generously as the shipbuilder would like. But that is something to be reserved between the shipbuilder and the insurance carrier. And if litigation develops and is resorted to as a way to resolve that, so be it; that happens. But what we are seeking to do is to acknowledge that the shipbuilder was impeded by the hurricane from proceeding under contracts that it had with the Navy to hire and make available workers on a reliable, predictable schedule that would ensure the ships' future construction on time under the contract. Some of those costs cannot get reimbursed from the insurance company. There are provisions in the insurance agreements that prohibit the collection of benefits for some of those costs that were caused directly by the hurricane. So what we have attempted to do is to work with the Navy, consult with the shipbuilder, and try to provide authority in this supplemental bill to help control costs of ships, now and in the future, with a possibility of insurance proceeds offsetting Government costs. Or we can exclude this provision, as the Senator is trying to do, and pay the resulting higher costs through higher taxes, more appropriations to help pay the costs to the Navy to pay for the ships. To me, I think this amendment reflects a difference in understanding of what the language of the supplemental seeks to accomplish. We do not disagree with the motivation of the Senator from Oklahoma. We applaud his effort to review carefully and make sure we are not ``wasting'' money in this supplemental, that the taxpayer is benefiting, not a shipbuilder being unjustly or inappropriately enriched. I guarantee you that is not the purpose of the assistance that is provided in this section of the bill, this general provision of the bill. Here is what it seeks to do. And we think it does do this: The general provision adjusts ship contract target costs for the effects of Hurricane Katrina. It provides the U.S. Navy with reimbursement of future shipbuilder insurance receipts. And it makes clear that payments made by the Government to the shipbuilder could not be treated as collateral insurance coverage and could not be used as a reason for insurers not to honor their policy obligations. That is the purpose of the general provision. I challenge anybody to disagree with that purpose as laudable, as important, and as fair to the taxpayers, to the shipbuilder, and to the insurance companies that have coverage. This provision was included because it is clear that the impact for delaying the recapitalization of the shipyards will have long-term negative impacts to the Navy's shipbuilding program by making ships more expensive and taking longer to build. We can provide this authority now to help control the costs of ships, and with the possibility of insurance proceeds offsetting Government costs, or we can exclude this provision and pay for the resulting higher costs of ships. And note this. The estimated cost of this provision is $140 million, to be paid from within the $2.7 billion the President requested in the shipbuilding account. Hear that? The President requested $2.7 billion in his submission in this request. And a 3- to 6-month shipyard recapitalization delay is estimated to cost $300 to $600 million in increased ship costs. This is serious business. You can pay me now or pay me later. I guess that is the way to say it. But the whole point is, we can appropriate this money in this supplemental that the President requested. We have identified the part that is going to be used to pay the costs of this amendment. So in response to Hurricane Katrina and the disaster that resulted to the region, the President requested over $2\\1/2\\ billion--$1 billion in this supplemental and $1.7 billion in the last supplemental--in the Shipbuilding and Conversion Navy account to address these ordinary costs to replace destroyed or damaged equipment, prepare and recover naval vessels under contract, and, most relevant to this debate, provide for cost adjustments for naval vessels for which funds have been previously appropriated. So what happened is the President's request did not address or take into account all costs associated with Katrina. So a general provision was added to adjust an existing Navy ship contract's target costs for the effects of Hurricane Katrina. It ensures the industry does not receive redundant funding from the Government and insurance companies. But--guess what--the amendment offered by the Senator, my friend, deletes this provision. That should not be done. The focus of this supplemental is to provide disaster relief and recovery for hurricanes, including Katrina. Katrina caused the costs of ships that were already under contract with the Navy to increase. Increased costs were occurring because of the disaster. The provision included in the bill does not impose additional costs. Instead, it directs that all costs be paid from within the $2.7 billion shipbuilding account requested by the President to address the hurricane recovery costs. In my view, the Senate needs to reject the amendment of the Senator. Let's carry forward in this bill this general provision.","word.count":1085,"sep11":4.75842696629214,"years":2006.61797752809,"days":4136,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.918941292981129,"Topic 2":0.0252643193570247,"Topic 3":0.00571166201091319,"Topic 4":0.014500441501902,"Topic 5":0.00561864308757494,"Topic 6":0.00641718114804108,"Topic 7":0.00447114065173714,"Topic 8":0.0110674575408803,"Topic 9":0.00556869816782298,"Topic 10":0.00243916355297429},{"id":"11020070053991","body":"John Shimkus: Without objection, it is so ordered","word.count":1463,"sep11":6.3314606741573,"years":2008.19101123596,"days":4696,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0582721072708761,"Topic 2":0.304048831410586,"Topic 3":0.00226288242510518,"Topic 4":0.532117807924465,"Topic 5":0.0016882930812977,"Topic 6":0.00808018713678356,"Topic 7":0.0432274150209696,"Topic 8":0.00196357778011523,"Topic 9":0.0449807544124467,"Topic 10":0.00335814353735456},{"id":"10419950147425","body":"Patrick Leahy: Mr. President, there are some things, however, that are getting through. The Senate, in one of its final votes before adjourning for Christmas, passed legislation aimed at more than doubling the assistance that my State and others will have in hand to help victims of domestic crime and terrorism. I mention this, Mr. President, because I think of the years I spent as a prosecutor and I remember so many times we spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to prosecute a perpetrator, especially of a violent crime, both in the prosecution and in the incarceration, but the victim was usually the forgotten person. The victim got no assistance, the victim got no help, the victim was left to fend for himself or herself. What we have done now is raise to half a million dollars in a special victims fund for Vermont, under the Victims of Crime Act and under an amendment that I propose, that will help these people. I think this makes a great deal of sense because the money comes not from the taxpayers, the money comes from the criminals. The assessments and the fines to the criminal will go into this fund. Again, as a former prosecutor, I believe we should bring strong and effective prosecution as quickly as possible in these serious crimes. We have seen what happened in places like Oklahoma City. Let us not forget the victims. When we are setting out the punishment for the perpetrator of the crime, when we add fines and assessments, the money which can go to help victims all the better. In my experience, the victim is usually the person forgotten. All attention is on the criminal. This way, we will keep the attention on those convicted of violent crimes, but we will make them pay into a fund to help the victims. I think it is much better. I think victims must be treated with dignity and assisted and compensated for their suffering. Who better to pay for the restitution than the perpetrators of those crimes themselves?

Gonzalez: As the Senator leaves this institution later this year to pursue other interests, I want to take this opportunity, while I have it, while he is here, to thank him for his service to our Nation and certainly for his kind attention to me as both a majority and a minority member. Madam President, the bill before us provides a much needed increase of about $11 billion to the President's original budget request. I want to emphasize that this is still well below this year's funding level when adjusted for inflation. Since 1985, national defense funding has declined by 41 percent in real terms. Let me say that again, particularly for those who complain we are spending too much. Since 1985, the defense spending has fallen 41 percent. That is 11 straight years of decline, real decline. There are a variety of very important initiatives contained in this bill that I want to briefly highlight. They include, first and foremost, the 3-percent pay raise and a 4-percent increase in the basic allowance for quarters to our military men and women. We forget that every day, 24 hours a day, our Armed Forces are out there protecting us, serving our country. We found out this week how important that is and what sacrifice that calls for. If one were to look at the pay scale of those young men and women who were involved in that incident in Saudi Arabia, it is not a lot of money to risk their lives for. But they did not do it for money, and we all know that. So I am proud to support that pay raise, that 3- percent pay raise and that 4-percent increase in the basic allowance for quarters because these people give their all; sometimes they truly give their all. There is also $1.2 billion of additional readiness funding for the unfunded requirements of the service chiefs. There is an increase of $170 million for the cruise missile defense programs, including $40 billion for the Patriot ACM Program; legislation and funding to conduct competitive evaluations of promising laser programs. Antisubmarine warfare programs are also in this bill. There is an increase of $134 million to buy additional night vision goggles, thermal weapons sights and aiming lights to enhance Army and Marine Corps night-fighting capabilities. There is service funding and direction for the Navy to upgrade the effective jamming capabilities of the EA-6B also there, and a $700 million increase in military construction to enhance the quality of life of our troops and their families, and to improve readiness. On that point, Madam President, it is often forgotten--we talk about the big things, the submarines and the ships, the aircraft carriers and the airplanes and the missiles and missile defense. These are the big- ticket items, so to speak, that we find in the defense budget. But we had testimony earlier this year from the Commandant of the Marine Corps saying that at times he had leaky tents, sleeping bags that were falling apart, clothing that was not enough to keep the soldiers warm. These are the kinds of things that we overlook. When you put a soldier or sailor in a position like that, out there defending America, literally putting their lives on the line, they deserve the best we can provide them. I think we cannot overlook how important these so-called basics are. If you are out there in that tent and it is leaking and you are soaking wet, it is very basic to you. There is no excuse for ever allowing that to happen to our Armed Forces. So any time we can provide dollars in there--that is not glamorous. It does not get a lot of attention. And sometimes it is overlooked because it is not a glamour item. I am proud to support increases in funding in that area. Additionally, Madam President, the bill includes a number of important initiatives relating to ballistic missile defense, and it authorizes nearly $900 million in increased spending along the following lines: National missile defense, Navy Upper Tier Program, and the Theater High Altitude Area Defense Program as well, $134 million for a space and missile tracking system, and $50 million for the joint Israel-United States laser program known as Nautilus. This national missile defense program is so important, and we have had to fight, fight, fight, on the Senate floor even to get language, let alone dollars, for national missile defense. We have no defense against ballistic missiles. None. We cannot defend ourselves against an Iraqi, Iranian, North Korean, or Libyan missile. We need to be promoting this national defense program. A lot of people do not realize that. They say, ``What about the Patriot missile during the Persian Gulf?'' That was not designed to take out incoming missiles like the Scuds. We were able to do that. We were able to use improvisations on the Patriot and get it done, but we are not able to stop a ballistic missile. I am troubled by the administration's failure to comply with the law on missile defense. We tried to address it here last year in language and this year in language. We had to resort to writing a separate bill. The Congress has established very clear, firm schedules for the development and deployment of theater missile defenses in the fiscal year 1996 authorization bill. The President signed the legislation and never once complained about the schedule. In fact, for 3 years, the Clinton administration has stated that theater defense was their No. 1 priority. We are talking theater defense, not national defense. Yet in its budget submittal, the administration ignored the law and underfunded, I believe deliberately, the most important theater missile defense programs --THAAD and the Navy upper tier. Consequently, under the administration plan, our troops are vulnerable to hostile missile threats for as much as 4 or 5 years longer than mandated into law. This is simply unacceptable. We had a terrible tragedy this week in Saudi Arabia. It was terrible. It was a terrorist act. But that terrorist attack could very well have come from a missile, from a theater missile, as well. We have a lot of threats out there. It is not the cold war anymore, but we have a lot of threats. We have to be prepared to adapt to these threats. The bill codifies the so-called demonstrated capability standard for theater defense as a formal U.S. compliance policy. This action specifically mirrors the criteria proposed by the Clinton administration in Geneva 2 years ago. It is a responsible and appropriate standard, Madam President, and its codification in law supports the administration's position. I am pleased to be able to support the administration on this issue. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Acquisition and Technology, I want to speak just briefly on some initiatives included in the jurisdiction of my own subcommittee. Our review of the budget request highlighted a continuing trend within the administration of shortchanging investments in technology, development, and modernization in order to provide near- term relief for readiness. This is simply unacceptable. When you take dollars from the programs of the future to put them in some activity that you are conducting today, you are going to shortchange the troops of the future. We should be doing both. That is the truth. We should not be shortchanging the troops in the field. We should not shortchange the troops in the field of the future. That is where the technology and investment now in these technology programs is so important. Certainly today's readiness is important, but modernization is the key to long- term readiness. If people in the 1950's and 1960's in the Pentagon had not been farsighted enough to come up with the weapons that we used in the Persian Gulf, the price of oil would be a lot higher today and the outcome of that war could very well have been different. In order to have the weapons of the future, you have to invest today. The acquisition and technology section of the bill emphasizes three main concepts. First, it encourages more innovative thinking in the area of emerging operational concepts, and, in particular, the bill supports the Marine Corps' Sea Dragon and the Army's Force 21 initiatives, which seek to leverage technology to change the nature of warfare. It is the futuristic things that we are looking at here. What is war going to be like 10, 15, or 20 years down the road? Will we be ready to help the soldier, sailor, marine, air man or woman in the field? What will it be like 20 years from now? You need to have your think tanks and the best minds in the services out there trying to get a handle on that, looking at what that technology may be and begin to fund it. The bill seeks to reward, not discourage--reward--more innovation, to challenge the services to question traditional doctrine. Do not just do it tomorrow because we did it yesterday. Challenge the services to question this doctrine and to develop new strategies and tactics that leverage the revolutionary capabilities that technology now provides. I emphasize the word ``revolutionize.'' Sometimes we get evolutionary in our approach to things rather than revolutionary. I use the example of the Hubble telescope. That was a revolutionary item because it allowed us to see out into deep space things we have never seen before. That was revolutionary. Those are the kinds of breaks with the past, breaks with the present, futuristic approaches that we need to encourage. That is what we have tried to do in this committee. We are a $9 billion budget out of a $262 billion budget, but we tried to make the best of what we had. The second priority is the increased use of commercial technologies by the services. The bill provides a significant beginning for dual- use, cost-shared programs in the services, as well as a portion of the dual-use program in the budget requests. The key to integrating more commercial practices into the acquisition framework is not simply to spend more money on some stand-alone program, but rather to make commercial practices and products part of th","word.count":183,"sep11":-5.9185393258427,"years":1995.94101123596,"days":335,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0311944833528855,"Topic 2":0.381332197550428,"Topic 3":0.00448561722913104,"Topic 4":0.149647435553116,"Topic 5":0.0175295895417548,"Topic 6":0.00382003921595606,"Topic 7":0.0362224861302322,"Topic 8":0.0344760488944721,"Topic 9":0.304238681425607,"Topic 10":0.0370534211064166},{"id":"10820030073657","body":"Dianne Feinstein: Mr. Pryor calls Roe v.

He has written that he could ``never forget January 22, 1973, the day seven members of our highest court ripped out the life of millions of unborn children.'' That is a quote. It is a very strong statement. He has lobbied for the repeal of section V of the Voting Rights Act. After the Bush v. Gore decision, Pryor made the astounding statement, ``I'm probably the only one who wanted [the decision] 5-4 . . . I wanted Governor Bush to have a full appreciation of the judiciary and judicial selection so we can have no more appointments like Justice Souter.'' This is a sitting attorney general taking on a Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court by name. I have never heard of that before. Of course, there is always a first time. It was also an attack on a Justice who was well known as being more moderate than he was expected to be and who does not simply toe a party line. So is Mr. Pryor saying he would want only those judges who remain completely faithful to the ideology of those who choose them? Is he saying that Justice Souter is simply not conservative enough? I think he is. Mr. Pryor has taken positions so extreme that they are at odds with the rest of the Nation's attorneys general. For example, he was the only attorney general to argue against a key provision in the Violence Against Women Act on federalism grounds. So there is a reason we feel strongly about it. My experience is that in appointing someone to the trial bench when that individual has never been a judge is probably a good idea, even if they are an attorney general. One can make some judgments about people who hold political office and who are strong advocates as to whether in fact they can separate themselves from their ideology, whatever that ideology may be. I believe people can do this. I voted for Jeffrey Sutton because I had that belief. In this case, I am not so sure because the rhetoric is so strident and so very intemperate. The Senator from Alabama, who is present on the floor, believes he can, and there are people who believe he can. But I think the jury is out because there is a venture into an attack on a sitting U.S. Supreme Court Justice, there is a characterization of a landmark Supreme Court case as ``an abomination,'' and other things as well. There is an attack on many significant--significant to those of us on this side of the aisle--pieces of Federal legislation. Truly, this is a nomination that deserves and merits debate--an open debate. But I would like the debate to take place with the observation of the rules of the committee and after the investigation that is ongoing is finished. I hope the Senator from North Dakota's importuning to leadership is taken. We don't need to have a cloture vote at this time on this nominee. That cloture vote can come after the results of the investigation are finished--certainly after the Energy bill--because I think if a cloture vote is taken, these arguments I have made on the merits of the case are really going to be dispositive as far as votes on our side are concerned.

Once again, Mr. President, there has been a tremendous miscarriage of justice by the Judiciary Committee. By a vote of 10 to 9, a unanimous, partisan block of Democrats--10 Democrats--voted against the nomination of Priscilla Owen, who had been nominated by the President to a seat on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. The way this nomination was handled is a cause for great concern as well as the fact that, once again, the Senate will not have a chance to vote on a eminently qualified and experienced nominee to serve on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. I am convinced that had her nomination been permitted to make it to the floor--as the Republican Majority in the past allowed numerous controversial Democrat nominees to get to the floor--Judge Owen would be approved by the full Senate and she would be confirmed. We always hear the arguments of those who say that there have been actions in the past where nominees who were qualified were not given votes. However, during the time when I was majority leader I remember numerous cases where despite the belief of many Senators on our side that the nominees' views were far, far outside the mainstream, we still permitted their nominations to come to the floor. We did that because while we disagreed with their political and ideological views, it was still hard to argue that they were not professionally qualified. Mr. President, I specifically remember the nominations of Marsha Berzon, Richard Paez and Rosemary Barkett. Certainly, these nominees, while they were qualified, were in my opinion not near as qualified in the legal profession as Priscilla Owen. Berzon had had no judicial experience whatsoever. And a minority of the ABA evaluation committee gave Berzon and Paez only a ``qualified'' rating whereas the ABA committee unanimously--unanimously--gave Priscilla Owen its highest rating of ``well qualified.'' Beyond professional qualifications, numerous Senators on this side of the aisle also had severe concerns that Berzon, Paez, and Barkett were very far out of the mainstream in light of their records which raised questions for many Senators as to whether they should be confirmed. Marsha Berzon had been a prominent ACLU and Labor Union lawyer who opposed parental consent laws for minors' to have abortions and had worked against the rights of individual workers in favor of the rights of unions. She was also a prominent and active member of the Brennan Center for Justice that cranked out initiatives it characterized as ``stand[ing] up to right-wing attacks on the judiciary.'' Richard Paez had written publicly of his belief that whenever judges feel legislatures have failed to act, ``there's no choice but for the courts to resolve the question that perhaps ideally and preferably should be resolved through the legislative process.'' That is exactly the kind of judicial activism that Priscilla Owen's critics have falsely accused her of in order to give themselves an excuse for voting against her. Paez had also ruled as a district judge--prior to his confirmation to the appeals court--that States and cities could not outlaw was aggressive and intimidating panhandling by the homeless because it would infringe on a panhandler's free speech rights. Rosemary Barkett, while a Florida Supreme Court Justice, had argued for overturning the death penalty of a man who had brutally murdered a youth in Jacksonville and then sent a tape to the victim's mother describing the horrible details of the killing. An opinion signed by Barkett opposed the death arguing that the killing was ``a social awareness case . . . effectuated to focus attention on . . . racial discrimination.'' Nevertheless, despite the misgivings and question marks from an ideology standpoint as to whether or not they should be confirmed, the Republican majority permitted all three of these nominations to come to the floor and be voted on by the full Senate and all three were confirmed. Now, in contrast to these three far left nominees, let me speak to Priscilla Owen's qualifications. First of all, I am not one who thinks it is particularly important whether the American Bar Association rates a nominee qualified or not. But, of course, the ABA's judgment has been described by a number of leading Democrats as the gold standard in terms of evaluating a nominee's qualifications to serve in the Federal judiciary. Senator Leahy and senator Schumer described it that way in a March 16, 2001 letter to the President insisting that the ABA's role in the judicial confirmation process had to be maintained. However, that did not prevent them from voting against Priscilla Owen after she received a ``well qualified'' rating from the American Bar Association--the highest possible rating they could give and they gave it to her unanimously. This is also the first instance, I believe, that we have had of a nominee rated ``well qualified'' by the American Bar Association being defeated in the Judiciary Committee and the Senate. So, from the standpoint of the American Bar Association, this nominee certainly more than qualified. Also, Mr. President, when you look at Judge Owen's record, it is clear that she has a long record of being outstanding not only academically and intellectually, but also from the standpoint of character, experience, and professionalism as well. This is a nominee who has had a stellar legal career. She graduated with honors from Baylor Law School and its undergraduate program and made the highest score on the Texas bar exam the year she took it. She then had a highly regarded legal practice with a leading law firm in Texas for 17 years. She then gave up her lucrative private sector practice to serve with distinction for the past eight years on the Texas State Supreme Court. She was elected, in a contested race, as I understand it, and then reelected unopposed with over 80 percent of the vote. She still enjoys overwhelming community support. She has been publicly endorsed and supported by Democrats and Republicans, including 15 former presidents of the Texas Bar Association. Every major newspaper in the state also supports her. Mr. President, there is no question this nominee is qualified by experience, by education, and by the time that she spent in the Texas Supreme Court, where she has built up a very fine record of being a fair judge who has worked very hard in understanding the issues that have been before her and in casting her votes on the supreme court. Yet, last week, I was shocked to hear her described by Senator Daschle as not qualified. These are exact quotes: ``We will confirm qualified judges.'' ``Don't send us unqualified people.'' Whatever you may be able to say about might be wrong with this nominee--because maybe she is too conservative, or maybe on she did not meet some litmus test from the liberal outside interest groups or because she didn't meet the test of a particular Senator--in no way could you describe this nominee as not being qualified or as being unqualified. I am very worried when we see this sort of pattern developing. There have probably been very few nominees in the past to serve on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals more qualified than this nominee by every category you might bring to bear. Let me remind my colleagues on this point what the their gold standard ABA's actual standards are. Let me quote what the ABA itself says it looks at when it rates nominees. The ABA itself also notes that its standards are even higher for Appellate Court Nominees. Again, Mr. President, when the ABA applied these standards to Priscilla Owen they unanimously rated her ``well qualified.'' So it is a shame to characterize this nominee as somehow being professionally unqualified and it is a shame that the full Senate was denied an opportunity to vote on her because of a partisan, straight party-line vote of 10-9 with all Democrats voting against her. Again, in my opinion, it reflects very poorly on the Senate, and I fear it will make it even more difficult for us to complete our work when we see these types of allegations leveled against such a fine nominee. It also puts even further into question the utility and necessity of bothering to have the ABA evaluate judicial nominations when the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee are going to put ideology first and a nominee's professional qualifications and ABA rating a far second. Mr. President, I could not let that partisan and unwarranted vote in the Judiciary Committee go unnoticed by the leader of the Republicans, and correct the public record regarding a nominee with such outstanding legal credentials as Judge Owen. She is clearly qualified. I would note in closing that the Washington Post in an editorial published this past July 24 agreed with the President and Republicans when it said that: I hope we will ultimately find a way for this nominee to be confirmed before all is said and done. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Kentucky.","word.count":1555,"sep11":1.01966292134831,"years":2002.87921348315,"days":2805,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0391317906532042,"Topic 2":0.264990147650045,"Topic 3":0.0575628060302593,"Topic 4":0.021056218360047,"Topic 5":0.305282601877981,"Topic 6":0.00272027137857692,"Topic 7":0.00582523864062895,"Topic 8":0.0943380107054749,"Topic 9":0.108769433525923,"Topic 10":0.10032348117786},{"id":"11020070102503","body":"Johnny Isakson: I thank my colleague, Senator Chambliss Mr. President, I have great respect for Senator Grassley and Senator Dorgan.

This amendment punishes the farmer and his family who depend solely on the farm for their livelihood. Why should we take the greatest, most abundant food supply in the world and try to mess it up. That is exactly what this amendment would do. Don't let these big numbers fool you. These farmers each year take risks equal or greater than those of their brethren in any other business. In fact, just alone, the equipment a farmer buys today in most cases exceeds the cost of the home that most other Americans buy. Some argue it is wrong for these payments to go to a small number of big farms. But it is these very farms that are producing the vast majority of our agricultural products. We should be supporting those who are fueling the economic engine of our country. Why should anyone want to punish family farmers who have made very large investments in order to become competitive in an international marketplace? Why are we going to hurt farmers who are trying to provide a decent living for their families in the face of tremendous challenges and soaring costs of production? They do not deserve this kind of treatment. With much of our Nation's farmland in a drought and input costs at record highs, why should anyone want to limit assistance during this time, at a time when our farmers need our help and need it most? I urge my colleagues to oppose the Dorgan-Grassley amendment. Let's unify America in our ag policy, not have sectional differences, certainly not have sectional penalties. Let's not allow one part of the country to be gutted to the benefit of another.

Here is what we do not know. My hope is that since this continuing resolution would originate from the House, that on the House side they would have put into the resolution the language, the authority, for us to go forward with accelerated funding right now. There are many Representatives, Democrats and Republicans, who are very uncomfortable with where we are at in this Nation. Thank God they are. There are people who feel--they are saying, ``Look. We don't just want to be here while people go cold.'' All right. So my hope would be that you would have a resolution that would come over here with a formula that would allocate the funds that we need to get out to the States so people do not go cold. People are cold now. If that does not happen, then certainly we can amend that. That is one possibility, we can amend that, and we would insert wording that would make sure that we would get the allocation of funding out. We could do that. I say to my colleague that that is a possibility. Now, if it was for 2 days, over the weekend, then another possibility--though we have to see--would be, depending upon commitments that are made, that it would be done in the beginning of next week.

We have to do everything we can to make sure that we get this funding out to families in our States so people do not go cold through a continuing resolution today or through a continuing resolution Monday or through the administration, if there is no continuing resolution, releasing the funds. It has to happen. It makes very little difference to the people out in our States who are cold, who are really frightened, many of whom are desperate, what way the funding gets to them and what way they get the energy assistance. We can do it a number of different ways. But I have gone on record all week saying--I believe we have some amendments that we drafted to this continuing resolution.

Durbin: Mr. President, first, I wish to thank my colleague, Senator Schumer from New York, for his leadership on this issue and Senator Martinez of Florida and Senator Carper, who played an important role in making certain this bill came to the floor. It is timely. It is important. Back the late 1920s, the United States faced an overwhelming housing crisis. The values of homes were plummeting, and the availability of credit to buy homes was in jeopardy. At that time, President Franklin Roosevelt and others stepped in, in 1932 and beyond, to make a massive commitment to restoring the American dream for thousands, if not millions, of American families. One of the means by which it was restored was the creation of the Federal Housing Administration. This Government agency stepped into the process of mortgages and said: We will provide backing and guarantee and assurance it is safe to buy a home, and it is safe to loan the money. That started to restore the confidence of the American consumers in our housing market--a confidence which led to the dramatic expansion of home ownership in America, the expansion of personal wealth, as families invested in their homes and saw their assets grow, and then the investment of the growth of America's communities, neighborhoods, and towns. It is part of the American dream. Not a single one of us will forget the first home we ever purchased. Moving from being a renter to a homeowner is a watershed in anyone's life. Your feeling about where you live and what you want to put into where you live changes when you become a homeowner. Now we are involved in another housing crisis. It is a crisis which many want to minimize. But they should not. The fact that 2.2 million Americans face foreclosure is not just your neighbor's misfortune, it is a misfortune for your neighborhood. It is a misfortune for our Nation. That is why this bill is so important. We are trying to find ways to bring that same type of confidence and liquidity back into the housing market. That is why this bill is timely and should be passed on an emergency basis. When the Federal Housing Administration, the FHA, steps up and increases the loan limits, it means it is a realistic appraisal of today's housing market, so they are relevant to the needs of average families who pay higher costs now for housing than they did a few years ago. When we reduce the downpayments, it means some families will have their chance to move into a home even earlier in their earning years, rather than waiting and renting and perhaps missing that opportunity. I am heartened by the fact that this bill includes counseling--not only counseling for the purchase of a home but counseling when a family is troubled and worried about whether they can continue to make their mortgage payments. All of these are moves in the right direction. I can tell you many think this housing crisis is an isolated crisis in America. It is not. Mr. President, 2.2 million foreclosures will lead to the reduction in value of 44 million single family residences, condos, and other units of home ownership. Forty-four million homes will lose value because of foreclosures. I have seen it on the West Side of Chicago, where gentrificaton and modernization have taken neighborhoods that were nothing more than vacant lots and turned them into town homes and row houses that are worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Now one of the houses on the block is boarded up, facing foreclosure and an auction, realizing at the auction the asking price is likely to be at least 20 percent to 30 percent lower than the value that was originally assessed on the home. That means every home in the neighborhood takes a hit. What does it mean when 44 million homes lose value in America? It means 1 out of 3 homeowners in America will see a decline in the value of their home. It is not just the house you are living in, it is also the most important asset in most family's lives. That is why this bill is needed. That is why we need to move forward as quickly as possible. Let me say, even with this bill, even with Secretary Paulson's proposal 2 weeks ago, these are modest steps that need to be built upon. It is not enough. It is good. I want to see it move. It is important. We need to do more. This housing crisis has become an economic crisis in America, and we need to face it squarely. Franklin Roosevelt did in the 1930s. We need to do that today. Let me add a word too. I want to change the bankruptcy law so a family facing foreclosure, going into bankruptcy, has one last chance in the bankruptcy court to renegotiate the terms of their mortgage. You can do that today if you take a vacation home into your bankruptcy or your family farm into a bankruptcy. But the law prohibits the renegotiation of the terms of your mortgage for your principal residence. That makes no sense whatsoever. A foreclosure can cost the parties involved up to $50,000. The ultimate sale of the home, after foreclosure, can bring maybe 70 percent or 80 percent of the actual value of the home. Now what we need to do is look at a comprehensive approach to deal with the housing crisis which threatens our economy. I urge strong support for this legislation. I yield the floor.","word.count":932,"sep11":6.4185393258427,"years":2008.27808988764,"days":4727,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.113478341821275,"Topic 2":0.249089947256537,"Topic 3":0.00967261992240531,"Topic 4":0.0066084593636479,"Topic 5":0.0112212898251782,"Topic 6":0.489471158688857,"Topic 7":0.0957658483874706,"Topic 8":0.00918353758318185,"Topic 9":0.0133452712692684,"Topic 10":0.00216352588217949},{"id":"10419960015366","body":"Nathan Deal: Mr. Speaker, I would briefly like to say that we should test this legislation by the light of reasonableness.

Here are the facts: ISTEA says that the allocation of funds among States shall be based on the most recent data available. That is what it says. The most recent data available, provided by the Treasury Department, was the data which was, in fact, provided under the law. In fact, if you will read the letter sent to Senator Baucus, basically that letter makes it clear that it is the Department of Transportation's position that it does not have authority to use anything other than the official accounts of the trust fund maintained by the Department of the Treasury in calculating apportionments among the States. Here is the point. When the Treasury gave their estimate, they gave that estimate based on the best data they had available and required by the law. It is true that, if you go back after the fact and take data that they did not have that they could have had, you could have allocated funds differently. But to call that an error is simply a misuse of the English language. The Department of Transportation used the best estimate they had based on the data they had. Now, what the Senator from Montana is trying to do is to say that, because they did not have data then which they now have, that we should now go back and alter allocations. No one disputes that the 1997 formula, which is in the bill before us, is based on the newest data, which no one disputes as being the best available data that apparently everyone is satisfied with, no one says that the allocation of funds in this bill are in any way unfair for fiscal year 1997. If they do, I have not heard it. But what the Senator is saying is that because the Treasury did not have final 1994 data in 1996 when they did the estimate, and because they gave the best data available, complied with the letter and the spirit of the law, that knowing now what that data turned out to be after the fact that we could go back last year and rewrite the formula. Clearly, ISTEA provides no authority whatsoever to do that, and what is being sought here is rewriting ISTEA. This is legislation on an appropriations bill. This is taking an allocation for 1997, that no one disputes as being valid, and changing it to reallocate funds to reflect an allocation that would have occurred had the Department of Transportation had data which was not available. It seems to me that this is gamesmanship that we can engage in endlessly. Let me give you an example. Next year we may have the final 1995 data. Next year we might even have the 1996 data. It would be possible for this Senator or any other Senator next year to stand up and say, ``When the allocation was done for 1997, the Department of the Treasury relied on 1995 data, but actually, if they had known what the 1996 tax collections would have been, they could have had a different allocation.'' My point being, this amendment could be offered every single year because there is a lag in available data that the Treasury is able to provide the Department of Transportation to do these estimates. What we have done in the past is simply each year made the fairest estimate that we could make. But I am not aware that we have ever gone back retroactively and said, if Treasury had had newer data and if they had provided it to the Department of Transportation data that we now know but was not known then, could not have been known then, that last year's allocation could be rewritten. I hope my colleagues will understand and agree with me that next year this same amendment could be offered because next year we will have the actual data for the next year in this series--1995-1996. We could stand up and argue that the actual allocation in the bill before us--not last year--is wrong because it is based on 1995 data which is the best data available but that next year when we get 1996 data it might produce a different allocation. The point is that while 31 States in fact do benefit, some very slightly, by this reallocation, this amendment could be offered every single year to every Department of Transportation allocation of funds under ISTEA because each year we get a new data point. You could take that data point which was not available when the funds were allocated by the formula, but, if it had been available, the allocation would have been different. Do we want to do this every single year? Am I to stand up next year when the 1996 data is available and say had we known in writing in the 1997 allocation what the actual 1996 data was, which we do not know today, that the allocation would have been different and Texas would have gotten more money and, therefore, I want to go back retroactively and take money in the 1998 bill away from some other State, perhaps Montana, to give to Texas? I think this is a very, very bad precedent, and it is something that could be done every single year. That is the point. I hope that we will not do this because we are setting a precedent that it seems to me simply leaves chaos in the allocation of these funds. I yield the floor.","word.count":928,"sep11":-5.24719101123596,"years":1996.61235955056,"days":574,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.92195390140549,"Topic 2":0.0255481363647494,"Topic 3":0.00552604129604835,"Topic 4":0.0137815257486763,"Topic 5":0.00547252275216325,"Topic 6":0.00603072008075391,"Topic 7":0.00423163114671835,"Topic 8":0.00988972417587558,"Topic 9":0.0052482108896326,"Topic 10":0.00231758613989185},{"id":"10419950107598","body":"Russ Feingold: Mr. President, along with my good friend the senior Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], I am introducing legislation today to reduce the number of political employees who are appointed by the President. Specifically, the bill caps the number of political appointees at 2,000. The Congressional Budget Office [CBO] estimates the current number averages 2,800. Thus an estimated 800 of these positions would be saved. The measure, based on one of the options outlined by the CBO in its publication ``Reducing the Deficit: Spending and Revenue Options,'' is estimated to save $363 million over the next 5 years. The savings for fiscal year 1996 is estimated to be $45 million. Mr. President, this proposal is consistent with the recommendations of the Vice President's National Performance Review, which called for reduction in the number of Federal managers and supervisors, arguing that ``over-control and micromanagement'' not only ``stifle the creativity of line managers and workers, they consume billions per year in salary, benefits, and administrative costs.'' That argument may be particularly true will respect to political appointees, whose numbers grew by over 17 percent between 1980 and 1992, over three times as fast as the total number of executive branch employees. And if we look back further, to 1960, the growth is even more dramatic. In his recently published book, ``Thickening Government: Federal Government and the Diffusion of Accountability,'' author Paul Light reports a startling 430-percent increase in the number of political appointees and senior executives in Federal Government between 1960 and 1992. The sentiments expressed in the National Performance Review were also reflected in the 1989 report of the National Commission on the Public Service, chaired by former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker. Arguing that the growing number of Presidential appointees may ``actually undermine effective Presidential control of the executive branch,'' the Volcker Commission recommended limiting the number of political appointees to 2,000, as this legislation does. Mr. President, it is essential that any administration be able to implement the policies that brought it into office in the first place. Government must be responsive to the priorities of the electorate. But as the Volcker Commission noted, the great increase in the number of political appointees in recent years has not made Government more effective or more responsive to political leadership. The Commission report cited three reasons. First, it noted that the large number of Presidential appointees simply cannot be managed effectively by any President or White House. This lack of control is aggravated by the often competing political agendas and constituencies that some appointees might bring with them to their new positions. Altogether, the Commission argued that this lack of control and political focus ``may actually dilute the President's ability to develop and enforce a coherent,","word.count":455,"sep11":-6.36516853932584,"years":1995.49438202247,"days":176,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.194246012146435,"Topic 2":0.211576311761562,"Topic 3":0.0140572613622817,"Topic 4":0.146663675734458,"Topic 5":0.00764984079456646,"Topic 6":0.386262047117353,"Topic 7":0.00767130382035415,"Topic 8":0.0127031462347957,"Topic 9":0.00867430300812735,"Topic 10":0.0104960980200667},{"id":"11020080034563","body":"Michele Bachmann: Madam Speaker, over the weekend Secretary Paulson asked taxpayers to pony up an astonishing $700 billion to buy financial services sector debt on top of the existing bailouts that are already implemented this year.

Yesterday, Monday, April 3, Secretary Leavitt arrived hours late in a blue bus after people had waited and waited in very cold weather. He spent only a few minutes, shook the hands of a couple of staff people, and spoke briefly with only two hand-picked seniors, and, by the way, spoke to them in front of the news cameras, before making his prepared remarks to the press. To the one senior that had a chance to ask the Secretary a question, explaining that they could not afford their medicines, he towed the administration line saying, ``This is a good program that helps a lot of people.'' When asked by one senior about the program not covering his wife's medication needs, incredibly, the Secretary answered in the same way, and this was to the one person, ``This is a good program that helps a lot of people.'' Now, the Secretary had his picture taken. It was on the front page of our newspaper, but of the 79 people in the room, he shook hands with only two, spoke to only one and left. I guess he is doing this all over the country. The Secretary says, yeah, this program has had a few bumps in the road. It is a new program but we fixed them. No, Mr. Secretary, you have not fixed them and they are more than bumps in the road. The one thing that is guaranteed is that the pharmaceutical companies are making billions. Here are a couple of comments that have come from consumers and seniors in my district. A husband and wife team says they take five prescriptions each. Under their old plan they had a 20 percent co-pay, but by this summer they will have reached the $2,250 cap. And the new drug plan is a farce and an insult to seniors of this country because now they are going to have to pay the amounts beyond that and they ask, ``Is there anyone that cares or is listening in Washington?'' Another husband wrote, ``It is costing my wife and me more per month for the new Medicare coverage premium. The only way we have any coverage is to purchase an insurance policy from a private insurance company. On top of that there are the ridiculous amounts that Medicare has set that won't cover any meds until we reach some huge amount in the thousands of dollars. My wife informed me today she is going off her psychiatric medicine. We used to receive patient assistance directly from the drug manufacturers through a clinic and we can no longer receive the drug samples or any patient assistance. We cannot afford to purchase our meds, Congresswoman. Isn't it wonderful how the Bush government has helped us?'' Another senior writes they find that their medical costs increase at every turn in the road. They currently pay nearly $6,000 annually for prescriptions of which insurance pays $600. ``For the first four months of the year,'' this senior says, ``I have to pay $5 for generic drugs, $18 for preferred drugs, with a cap of $35 for the brand name drugs. But under this new plan that will increase to $10, $25 and $50. And believe it or not, of the eight prescription drugs I need, only two are on the preferred list for $25 each and the rest will each cost $50 each. Congresswoman, please do your part in righting this wrong.'' Health professionals have been writing to us. Another senior wrote us, ``When I went to the pharmacy to pick up my prescription I brought $20 with me because that is what I always paid. I couldn't believe it when the pharmacist said I had to pay $260. I had to leave the pharmacy without medicine. It was embarrassing. How am I going to afford $260 a month? I just don't have it. I guess the people who are for this plan want us to die.'' Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight not just to outline problems with the program, because they are significant, but also to place in the Record what we can do to fix it. First of all, to let the government negotiate the prices that seniors have to pay with these pharmaceutical companies. They can't stand up to these big companies. We need to extend the deadline this year so that they can try to get qualified for the program, but there is so much confusion out there. Why should there be a May deadline? We ought to cushion that. We ought to standardize plans like we did for Medicare part B so there is only 10 standard plans and people know what is in them. We ought to ban the gifts that these pharmaceutical companies are giving to people as lures in order to try to sign them up for these inadequate programs. We ought to disclose coverage gaps. Companies which do not offer gap coverage should be required to make that fact known in writing. We ought to disclose plan changes. It should be stated clearly that a company might drop a drug from coverage. We ought to create uniform ID numbers, simplify the application, expand extra help eligibility, and require broad formularies. There are many other ways to fix this program, Mr. Speaker, but we surely should not put that burden on our seniors.","word.count":926,"sep11":4.67977528089888,"years":2006.5393258427,"days":4108,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.115022183114293,"Topic 2":0.2024597963412,"Topic 3":0.0589532817603379,"Topic 4":0.0242631007942074,"Topic 5":0.203589950563583,"Topic 6":0.154272855750146,"Topic 7":0.00324594795904293,"Topic 8":0.217028864940592,"Topic 9":0.0160521109606508,"Topic 10":0.00511190781594682},{"id":"10820030066855","body":"Max Baucus: Mr. President, tomorrow morning the Senate will continue to debate on the Senate intelligence reform resolution.

With that anniversary came a round of reflection on the status of our homeland defenses. There was general agreement on the verdict. Yes, we are stronger and safer at home, thanks to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security and other steps that we have taken since September 11, 2001. But no, we are not nearly as safe as we should be. We are not as safe as we should be because this administration has not given homeland security the focused leadership and resources that it demands. The Gilmore commission, led by former Virginia Governor James Gilmore, a distinguished Republican leader, recently warned of complacency about the terrorist threat and decried the lack of a clear strategy to bring about improved security. Other expert panels, one of them convened and led by former colleagues Warren Rudman and Gary Hart, called the Nation ``still unprepared'' to respond to another September 11 attack and said that our first responders were ``drastically underfunded.'' Homeland security will not come cheap. On first responders alone, one of the expert panels I described told us they believe it would take $98 billion over 5 years to bring our defenses at home up to where they need to be. Yet the administration proposes a stunning 30-percent cut in resources for firefighters, police officers, and emergency medical personnel. The President's budget for fiscal year 2005 fails to acknowledge, much less address adequately, the new threats we face as a nation, shortchanging the homeland side of our war on terrorism. That is why I rise today to offer this amendment that would add $6.8 billion to the administration's homeland security budget. Let me describe where the money would go: $4.4 billion of that amount would go toward helping our first responders, the firefighters, the police officers, the emergency medical personnel, the hundreds of thousands of people who every day go to work, put on a uniform to serve not only as first responders but really, if we use them well, as first preventers of terrorist attacks. I also propose $900 million in additional resources for port and container security, widely acknowledged as a continuing vulnerability to terrorists who will strike always where we are undefended, and our ports and containers are too greatly undefended. I am calling here for $500 million to better prepare for the threat of bioterrorism, which recent intelligence reports say continues to be a focus of the terrorist groups around the world. I am asking for $500 million for additional border personnel as well as for needed equipment and technology for border security, so we will not see a repeat of the terrorists who came into America to carry out the evil deeds of September 11, 2001. I am asking for $\\1/2\\ billion to make further advances on aviation security and for greater protection of other modes of transportation-- rail, bus, mass transit--that remain too unprotected. About $2.5 billion of this amendment is needed just to restore cuts that the administration's budget makes in some of these homeland security functions from fiscal year 2004 spending. For example, in this amendment we restore the administration's $1 billion cut to the State homeland security grant program, the main source of assistance to State and local governments and first responders, an unacceptable cut. The amendment also would restore more than $1 billion in cuts to proven first responder programs in the Justice Department: the local law enforcement block grant, the Edward Byrne Memorial grant program, and the Community Oriented Policing Services Program, widely and appreciatively known as COPS. If someone asked whether we have been safer since September 11 from another attack, I just say: Thank God, we have been safe. But this is not an overreaction. Mr. Tenet testified before the Armed Services Committee the other day and he said that al-Qaida and more than two dozen other terrorist groups around the world are still in eager pursuit of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons. Their No. 1 goal--not their only goal--is to carry out another ``spectacular attack'' on the United States. Those are the terms they use, ``spectacular attack,'' which they are convinced will break our will and certainly disrupt our economy. We cannot let that happen. We must defend our homeland and protect our infrastructure and our people where we are vulnerable, through the Department of Homeland Security, with the kinds of funds that are authorized and appropriated in this amendment. We have a long way to go before we fulfill the promise each of us has made that our Federal Government would adequately secure the American people when they are at home. We have to approach this profound responsibility with the same unity, the same resolve, and the same resources we have brought to the war on terror overseas. That is why I have introduced this amendment and asked for my colleagues' support. Allow me to lay out, more specifically, what this amendment would do and why it is so necessary. I am advocating $4.4 billion in fiscal year 2005--above the President's request to help ensure that first responders have the equipment, training, and other resources they need to prevent, prepare for and if necessary respond to acts of terrorism. We all remember the heroic role police, firefighters and other first responders played on 9/11, as our Nation responded to the horrific attacks of that day and braced for untold sequels that might be soon to follow. Less visible is the role many of these officials also play in attempting to prevent acts of terrorism here at home: State and local police are the eyes and ears of the community that may first detect a terrorist plot on U.S. soil or intercept a terrorist before he or she can strike. We owe these front line homeland security troops more than our admiration we owe them our full financial support. Yet a distinguished panel convened by the Council on Foreign Relations found these first responders wanting for the tools they must have to confront a terrorist attack: firefighters without their own radios or breathing equipment; police departments without protective gear to respond to an attack with a chemical, biological or radiological agent; and nearly all without interoperable communications equipment. This is unacceptable and must be changed. Let's start with the work that must be done just to undo the harmful cuts sought by the administration. First, my proposal will restore the administration's drastic $1 billion cut to the State Homeland Security Grant Program, which is the main source of assistance to state and local governments and first responders for emergency planning, equipment, training, exercises, mutual aid agreements, and other preparedness activities. There is bipartisan support for restoring these cuts, reflecting the reality that all states face certain homeland funding needs and need a steady, predictable source of money-- as this program provides--to plan wisely. My amendment will also restore more than $1 billion in cuts to key first responder programs in the Justice Department: the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant , the Edward Byrne Memorial Grant Program , and the Community Oriented Policing Services Program . These programs provide vital aid to help communities hire more police officers and equip them with the tools they need. Funding levels for these three programs have declined more than $1.8 billion since fiscal year 2002, representing a dangerous and unwise reduction at a time when the threat from terrorism, but also domestic crime, has clearly increased. The amendment would also provide $400 million to restore a 33 percent cut in the vital Fire Act program, which provides direct support to thousands of fire departments around the country, and to bring it to full funding. And it restores a $9 million cut to the Emergency Management Planning Grants program, which supports the capacity of state and local governments to respond to emergencies of all kinds. All of these programs are integral to the strength of our first responders and it is incomprehensible that we would cut them at a time the terrorist threat remains high. But we must do more than just hold the line we need to dramatically improve our homeland defenses in our communities. My proposal would provide $1 billion in new funding to be dedicated to helping first responders obtain interoperable communications equipment so they can ``talk to one another'' when responding to events. The lack of communications interoperability has received substantial attention since the September 11, 2001 attacks revealed major problems with communication between police and fire fighters at the World Trade Center in New York. But the problem is hardly unique to New York. Federal officials involved with this issue report that at best--only 14 States have communications equipment that allows public safety agencies to talk to each other during a terrorist attack or other emergency. The price tag for fixing the problem nationwide has been estimated as high as $18 billion, and the lead Federal official on this issue has stated that, at the present rate, it will take 20 years to achieve full interoperability in our country. This is much too long. Yet, the President's 2005 budget actually takes a step backwards by eliminating relatively small grant programs at FEMA that were dedicated to interoperability. Instead, funding for interoperability must now compete with funds for protective gear, training, exercises, and other equipment. My proposal would dedicate $1 billion specifically for interoperability to provide a significant lift to States' efforts to overcome a critical obstacle facing emergency responders across America. In addition to equipment, this would include funding ne","word.count":764,"sep11":1.39606741573034,"years":2003.25561797753,"days":2939,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0213813829785443,"Topic 2":0.414169388791241,"Topic 3":0.0181076553736203,"Topic 4":0.00713715569730251,"Topic 5":0.0658616869928464,"Topic 6":0.342997412061527,"Topic 7":0.0217663851950574,"Topic 8":0.0644976531899415,"Topic 9":0.0331097324437889,"Topic 10":0.0109715472761315},{"id":"10519980060973","body":"Pat Roberts: Mr. President, I suppose that some of what I am going to say is repetitive in that most of this was discussed during the general debate. But I feel compelled to speak again because of the strong personal interest in this in behalf of myself and many of my colleagues who served on the House Agriculture Committee, and for that matter the Senate Agriculture Committee back in 1996. There has been a real success story in regards to the Food Stamp Program and reforms that have been initiated. In 1996, with all due respect to that program and others who supported it, it was a program out of control. It couldn't even be audited. The inspector general came in, an inspector general from New York--a tough cop, by the way, named Roger Viadero, who has done an outstanding job, basically said that the Food Stamp Program could not even be audited due to the fraud, abuse, and organized crime involvement. As a matter of fact, he had a tape that we showed during the Committee hearings which ended up on 60 Minutes. And we know all the stories about the Food Stamp Program, about the waiting in line, people with food stamps exchanging them for cash and then buying things that obviously did not represent a nutritious market basket of food. They got a new inspector general. We exposed the fraud and abuse on 60 Minutes and saved $3 billion to $5 billion in regard to the fraud and abuse. Then we instituted major reforms. I am talking about the Senate Agriculture Committee and the House Agriculture Committee--$24 billion, as the distinguished chairman has pointed out. I just do not think that is a success story that can be equaled. As a matter of fact, as to the person in charge of the Food Stamp Program there were many allegations made in regard to the performance of duty. She resigned. It is in better hands. Then we gave these reforms to the States. The States have come back with administrative savings. That is where the $1.7 billion comes in that has been referred to in terms of entitlement. And that money, I think, should be used for agriculture research, and I believe it also should be used for crop insurance and risk management. And, yes, there is some limited assistance in regard to food stamps. But let me refer to the comments made by the distinguished Senator from Texas whose concern I share. I certainly don't want any social welfare program, food stamps or otherwise, to be a beacon for people to come to this country when they wouldn't otherwise. But we are talking about refugees, and a refugee is defined as follows: A person who is fleeing because of persecution, or well- founded fear of persecution, on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion, and who is of special humanitarian concern to the United States. I don't think people choose to be a refugee. That is just not the case. People are not fleeing their country to come to the U.S. with a beacon held out there saying ``I am coming because of food stamps.'' And we have a cap on the number of refugees. It will be 75,000 admissions for the fiscal year as of 1999. Who are these people? The European numbers are used largely for Soviet religious minorities and Bosnians. East Asian numbers are for former Vietnamese, reeducation, camp detainees, and Laotians. I could keep on going down here. Basically, refugee admissions have fallen significantly from over 100,000 per year during fiscal year 1989. Now they are down to 75,000, and they are headed further downward. Here is the difference. The agriculture research bill's food stamp provisions mirror the SSI provisions of last year's Balanced Both Houses have approved that. Let's go back to the original food stamp reform that was passed in 1996 that I just talked about. These welfare reforms eliminated the benefits for anywhere from 800,000 to 950,000 noncitizens. This bill extends those benefits back to the children, the elderly, and the disabled who were in the country before August 22. That is the day of enactment of the bill. And, yes, it does also extend the benefits to refugees and asylees who may have entered after the August 22, 1996, debate. That means the total of the benefits will be restored to 250,000 people, not 900,000. I do not think this represents a step back from the far-reaching food stamp reforms that were passed back in 1996. I think if you take a hard look at these people, I don't think the Food Stamp Program represents a beacon in regard to any kind of a reason that they would come to the United States. I have already read the definition. I thank the distinguished chairman for yielding me this time.","word.count":815,"sep11":-3.42134831460674,"years":1998.43820224719,"days":1224,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.209382669315152,"Topic 2":0.291813796557553,"Topic 3":0.0175752150080409,"Topic 4":0.0109945148678223,"Topic 5":0.176362468076525,"Topic 6":0.205314288776839,"Topic 7":0.00615375927474849,"Topic 8":0.062475088148225,"Topic 9":0.0125572097001453,"Topic 10":0.00737099027494824},{"id":"10920050033239","body":"William Delahunt: Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman Mr. Speaker, it is my great privilege to rise today as the House considers House Joint Resolution 96, a bill I authored, to recognize the contributions of the live Christmas tree industry to the United States economy. Having been a Christmas tree farmer myself, I can attest to the importance of recognizing this often overlooked farming industry. My district is one of the largest producers of live-cut Christmas trees in the country. North Carolina has an estimated 50 million Fraser fir Christmas trees growing on over 25,000 acres. Fraser firs represent over 95 percent of all species grown in North Carolina. They are grown in the far western North Carolina counties, including Allegheny, Ashe, Avery, Buncombe, Haywood, Henderson, Jackson, Macon, Madison, Mitchell, Swain, Transylvania, Watauga and Yancey. There are over 1,600 North Carolina growers. The North Carolina Christmas tree industry is ranked second in the Nation in number of trees harvested, producing over 19 percent of the real Christmas trees in the United States. The North Carolina Fraser fir has been judged the Nation's best through a contest sponsored by the National Christmas Tree Association and chosen for the official White House Christmas tree nine times, more than any other species, in the years 1971, 1973, 1982, 1985, 1991, 1993, 1995, 1997 and 2005. The North Carolina Fraser fir Christmas tree is the most popular Christmas tree in North America and is shipped to every State in the U.S. as well as the Caribbean Islands, Mexico, Canada, Bermuda, Japan, and other points all over the world. The Christmas tree industry supports our economy and environment. Christmas trees are grown in all 50 States with North Carolina, Oregon, Michigan, Washington, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, New York, Minnesota, Virginia, California, and Ohio being the top Christmas tree-producing States. Nationally, there are more than 21,000 Christmas tree growers and more than 100,000 people employed in the live-cut Christmas tree industry. Thirty-six million of all live-cut Christmas trees are produced each year, and 98 percent are shipped or sold directly from Christmas tree farms. On average over 1,500 Christmas trees are planted per acre, providing an abundant habitat for wildlife. The retail value of all live Christmas trees harvested in 2005 was $1.4 billion. Live-cut Christmas trees have been sold commercially in the United States since 1850, and by 1900 one in five American families decorated live-cut trees during Christmas. By 1930 the tree had become a nearly universal part of the American Christmas. For generations American families have traveled hundreds and thousands of miles to celebrate the holiday season together at home around the Christmas tree. I think it is difficult to overstate the way that having a live, lit Christmas tree in a room can set a warm and positive tone for a family.

The supplemental appropriations bill seeks to place a moratorium on seven Medicaid regulations until the next administration. It also prevents implementation of a CMS policy to ensure States cover poor kids before expanding their SCHIP programs. I know some people have concerns with the CMS policies. Let me be clear: I am not here to argue the regulations are perfect. I have issues with some of them I would like to see addressed. However, the regulations do address areas where there are real problems in Medicaid. Medicaid is a Federal-State partnership that provides a crucial health care safety net for some very vulnerable populations . . . low- income seniors, the disabled, pregnant women, and children. They depend on Medicaid, and it does generally serve them well. Medicaid is also a program with a checkered history of financial challenges. Medicaid has a history of States abusively pushing the limits of what should be allowed to maximize Federal dollars sent to them. And while sometimes States have clearly pushed the envelope, at other times, States have struggled to understand what is and is not allowable in Medicaid. So after years of work by CMS, numerous reports by GAO and the Inspector General at HHS, and frequent Congressional hearings, CMS issued regulations to try to clarify the rules in some very problematic payments areas of Medicaid. I will start with the public provider regulation. We know that in the past, many States used to recycle Federal health care dollars they paid to their hospitals to use for any number of purposes beyond health care. It was an embarrassing scam that several administrations tried to limit. For years, the Medicaid Program was plagued by financial gamesmanship. States used so-called intergovernmental transfers or IGTs, to create scams that milk taxpayers out of millions--even billions--of dollars. Here is an example: a State bills the Federal Government for a $100 hospital charge. The hospital gets the $100 payment and then the State would require the hospital to give $25 of it back to the State. In my view, that is a scam. What happens to the $25? In the days before Congress and CMS cracked down on the behavior, the money could go to roads or stadium construction. That is right. Medicaid IGT scams paid for roads and stadiums instead of health care for the poor. In 1991, 1997 and again in 2000, Congress took specific action to limit the States' ability to use payment schemes to avoid paying the State share of Medicaid. CMS has continued their work since then. Over the past 4 years, CMS has been working with States to try to limit these scams. I will note these efforts have not been without their controversy. States have been very concerned about exactly what the new standards are. Senator Baucus and I wrote the GAO and asked them to look into what CMS has been up to in trying to limit the way States make these payments. We were concerned that there was not enough transparency in what CMS was doing. And CMS did publish a rule for all to see. It is out there in the open. The core goal of the rule is to limit provider reimbursement to actual cost. I know some people consider this a radical idea, but I just don't understand why anyone thinks it is a good idea to have hospitals paid more than cost so they can be a part of these scams that rob the taxpayer to fund State pork. Restricting payments to cost is not exactly a new idea. In 1994, GAO recommended that payments to government providers be limited to cost. This is a fundamental issue for program integrity. What did GAO find in their 1994 report that led them to this conclusion? The State of Michigan used these questionable transfers to reduce their share of the Medicaid Program from 68 percent, which is what it should have been, to 56 percent. The GAO found evidence that in October 1993, the State of Michigan made a $489 million payment to the University of Michigan. Within hours, the entire $489 million was returned to the State. The report found that in fiscal year 1993, Michigan, Tennessee, and Texas were able to obtain $800 billion in Federal matching funds without putting up the State Share. Congress and CMS have spent the last 17 years combating that behavior. Last year, the emergency supplemental included a provision to delay implementation of the public provider rule for 2 years. Fortunately, cooler heads prevailed and the delay was reduced to 1 year. But I wish to read what I said at the time. This is from remarks I made on March 28, 2007: That is the right way to operate. We should have dealt with it in the Finance Committee. We should have tackled the issues here that are extremely complex. They deserve thorough consideration so we can insure we are taking appropriate action. But a year has passed with no action and instead we are here with this amendment to the supplemental appropriations bill. No hearings have been held. No testimony submitted. Nothing. Making the CMS regulation go away opens the door for a return to the wasteful, inappropriate spending of the past. Intergovernmental transfers can have a legitimate role, but it is critical that States have a clear, correct understanding of what is a legitimate transfer and what is not. If the regulation goes away, those lines will still not be adequately defined. Why should we care if the lines are not adequately defined? Let me read from the National Conference of State Legislatures Web site: ``IGTs can enhance a State's Federal match and thus bring additional funds to the State in two main ways. First, States can use county funds instead of State funds to generate a Federal match to support services provided by counties. Second, States can use IGTs to help it claim additional Federal funds based on upper payment limits. Under this model, a State can make payments to eligible public facilities using the rate Medicare pays for the same service, a rate that may exceed the State's standard Medicaid reimbursement rate. If it chooses to do so, a State then could use a portion of the new revenues generated--a share of the portion that remains after the standard Medicaid rate is paid for other goods or services.'' States speak openly about these payment schemes to maximize Federal dollars flowing to the States. It is absolutely the worst thing we could do for the Medicaid Program to leave States without clear guidance on these types of payments. We cannot simply walk away from this subject. Now I would like to turn to the CMS regulation on graduate medical education. I personally think Medicaid should pay an appropriate share of graduate medical education or GME. But I would like to see us put that in statute rather than return to the current customary practice because I do not think the taxpayers are well served by the way Medicaid GME operates today. If we simply make the regulation go away, what are the rules for States to follow? There are five different methods States use in billing CMS, 11 States don't separate IME from GME, and CMS cannot say how much they are paying States for GME. Let me quote from a CRS memo I submitted for the Record during the budget debate a few months ago: ``States are not required to report GME payments separately from other payments made for inpatient and outpatient hospital services when claiming Federal matching payments under Medicaid. For the Medicaid GME proposed rule published in the May 23, 2007 Federal Register, CMS used an earlier version of the AAMC survey data as a base for its savings estimate and made adjustments for inflation and expected State behavioral changes, for example.'' To make their cost estimate for the regulation, CMS relied on a report from the American Association of Medical Colleges to determine how much they are paying for GME in Medicaid. That is because the States do not provide CMS with data on how much they pay in GME. That is simply unacceptable. You can disagree with the decision to cut off GME, but simply leaving the current disorderly and undefined structure in place is not good public policy. Now let me turn to the regulations governing school-based transportation and school-based administration. Is it legitimate for Medicaid to pay for transportation in certain cases I think the answer to that is yes. I do think it is legitimate for Medicaid to pay for transportation to a school if a child is receiving Medicaid services at school. That said, we should have rules in place that make it clear that Medicaid does not pay for buses generally. We should have rules in place that make it clear that schools can only bill Medicaid if a child actually goes to school and receives a service on the day they bill Medicaid for the service. You can also argue that the school-based transportation and administrative claiming regulation went too far by completely prohibiting transportation, but if making this regulation go away allows States to bill Medicaid for school buses and for transportation on days when a child is not in school, we still have a problem. It is also critical that Medicaid pay only for Medicaid services. We all openly acknowledge the Federal government does not pay its fair share of IDEA. Quoting from the CRS memo: ``States, school districts, interest groups, and parents of children with disabilities often argue that the Federal government is not living up to its obligation to `fully fund' Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act--IDEA, P.L. 108-446--the grants-to-States program.'' We can also acknowledge that just because IDEA funding is inadequate, States will try to take advantage of Medicaid to make ends meet. Again quoting from the CRS memo: ``It is generally assumed that such transportation is predominantly provided to Medicaid/IDEA children.'' If a child is requi","word.count":111,"sep11":6.29775280898876,"years":2008.15730337079,"days":4684,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.127512960011729,"Topic 2":0.242745076275724,"Topic 3":0.25271475533452,"Topic 4":0.0359009314816144,"Topic 5":0.192654378001781,"Topic 6":0.0496549190558216,"Topic 7":0.00145158327046965,"Topic 8":0.0870203614901912,"Topic 9":0.00553847930957708,"Topic 10":0.00480655576857258},{"id":"10419960013318","body":"Sander M.

This bill would ensure that our part-time and rural firefighters are not being treated as second class citizens. I want to thank Senator Craig for his hard work on this very important issue, and Senators Levin, Crapo, Rockefeller, and Jeffords for their support of this bill. Mr. President, many part-time and volunteer firefighters in rural and small communities across the country are not attending Office of Domestic Preparedness-approved terrorism response training courses because Federal guidelines do not allow them to be reimbursed for the time they are away from their full-time jobs. Our bill would simply direct the ODP to allow part-time and volunteer first responders, to receive a reasonable stipend when they participate in ODP-approved terrorism response courses. The Federal Government should not penalize rural and small communities and their firefighters from receiving training necessary to respond to a terrorist attack. In several counties in northern lower Michigan, State Homeland Security Grant funds sit unused because their fire departments are composed entirely of volunteer or part-time firefighters. Last year, the State of Michigan set aside $9 million in Homeland Security grants to prepare firefighters, including ODP training courses, to respond to terrorist incidents. However, this grant money is being underutilized since 72 percent of the firefighters in Michigan are volunteer or part-time and are not attending terrorism response training sessions. All firefighters need the capability to respond to all types of emergencies. When Americans call 9-1-1, the fire department doesn't send only their full-time firefighters, they send everyone regardless of their status. Most part-time firefighters in rural areas hold full- time jobs in addition to serving and protecting their communities. It is unreasonable to expect them to take leave from their regular jobs, and forgo their pay from their full-time jobs, to attend terrorism response training courses that include incident command, civil action management, and radiological response. Mr. President, many of our small, rural communities face the same homeland security challenges as larger cities with more resources. For example, Michigan has a long international border with Canada, and many of these small and rural border communities rely on part-time and volunteer firefighters. These responders must be capable of protecting these borders against the same terrorist threats that urban areas face. When there is an accident in the future and, God forbid, if there is a terrorist attack, we're not going to send only full-time firefighters to save people's lives. This bill was included as a bipartisan amendment to the Senate version of the fiscal year 2005 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations bill, but was removed by the House Republican leadership in conference. This issue is too important for Congress to ignore, and I am going to keep fighting until our volunteer and part-time firefighters are treated fairly and receive the terrorism response training they need. Mr. President, I'm pleased to note that the change in Federal guidelines this bill requires will not cost the Government any funding. It will not affect the distribution of State Homeland Security grants. It will just enable communities that have been awarded these grants to use them to pay their firefighters a reasonable stipend when they leave their full-time jobs and attend these terrorism response course. This is a matter of fairness to ensure that those that we rely on to respond to emergencies have the training they need. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:","word.count":601,"sep11":3.26966292134831,"years":2005.12921348315,"days":3606,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.540595011296693,"Topic 2":0.0281536542532545,"Topic 3":0.0160258437902086,"Topic 4":0.162882400802346,"Topic 5":0.00378300833084804,"Topic 6":0.016272377540561,"Topic 7":0.205425249990038,"Topic 8":0.0108481344522648,"Topic 9":0.0137028007230748,"Topic 10":0.00231151882071128},{"id":"10920060002678","body":"Peter DeFazio: Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to talk about foreign ownership of critical United States infrastructure assets. A number of people have followed the controversy regarding the UAE control over a number of critical American ports. Now, there is certainly some room for concern there, as many of us have spoken previously. The UAE was very closely tied to the perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks. They were one of three governments in the world that recognized the Taliban. They have recently been useful and helpful to the United States of America, but the history is not great, and people may have been embedded years ago in their government who would control it, it is not a private entity, who would be not friendly towards the interests of the United States. So there is concern there. And the concern is even compounded by the fact that we do not know who owns the ships. The U.S. has bound itself through international agreements that allow secret ownership of ships under flags of convenience, countries that barely exist or do not exist, Liberia, Malta, who is very happy to make money on this, but turns a blind eye. Osama bin Laden could own a fleet of ships. We are not allowed to know. But they can dock here in United States. We have done nothing about that. We do not know who crews the ships. They can buy papers in the Philippines and in International Maritime Organization School that the U.S. has been forced to recognize by being part of this agreement. And, again, we do not know who these people are. So we do not know who crews the ships, we do not know who owns the ships, we do not know what is on the ships. They have to send us a manifest and tell us what might be on the ship. It is an electronic transmission or a piece of paper. That does not mean that is what is really on the ship. We do not track the ships from port to port, so they could have stopped somewhere. Even if they do not have a nuclear bomb on board when they left Singapore, they could have picked one up on the way. And then we do not have the equipment that we need on this side of the ocean. So that is a tremendous concern. If you add on the concern of the ownership of Dubai, it reaches even higher proportions. But I also rise to talk about something else the Bush administration is trying to do. For them commerce is everything. National security is second or tertiary in terms of their concerns. They are trying to reinterpret the meaning of the word ``control.'' They said, when Congress said foreigners cannot control United States airlines, Congress did not mean control. In fact, in their world they are saying, well, foreigners could control U.S. airlines, they could only just control them commercially, but they could not safety and security. If you have foreign management, foreign ownership, how do you wall off safety and security? So they are proposing, by administrative rule, sometime later this month or early next month, to defy the dictionary and legal interpretations of control and say Congress did not mean what it said. Now, if you think there is an outcry about the ports, wait until we are sending U.S. troops overseas on what is called part of the Civilian Reserve Air Fleet. The large planes that our airlines fly are actually part of our Reserves, and we fly our troops with these planes over to the Mideast and other trouble spots around the world. Wait until we are asking U.S. troops to get onboard a plane being flown by a pilot from Dubai or from Indonesia or somewhere else around the world. This would be an extraordinary national security problem, in addition to losing domestic air service. Because what is happening here is airlines like United, who have been managed into the ground by overpaid CEOs, and others are looking to sell themselves out to foreign airlines. Their first choice is Lufthansa, but they may well go with the UAE, and then to cut off most of their domestic service, shed the wide-body planes and bring in foreign pilots to do the overseas routes and provide minimal domestic service. So not only are we putting at threat our national security and the Civilian Reserve Air Fleet, we are also putting at risk the American public and we are certainly degrading the capability of providing the service we need to have a system of universal air transport which serves our economy and the businesses in the United States of America. This is a colossally bad idea with the Bush administration trying to do it in back rooms by pretending that when Congress said foreigners cannot control our airlines that we did not really mean it. If the Bush administration persists in this, 6 months or a year from today, we will be here on the floor of the House if this Congress does not preempt this, which they have thus far refused to do. If they do not preempt this, we will be back here arguing about the UAE or Indonesia or some other country taking over a major U.S. airline and the assets of our Civilian Reserve Air Fleet. We should preclude that. Next week when we bring up prohibition of ownership of critical infrastructure assets, airlines should be part of that bill. There is big resistance from the administration and some of the leadership. The membership has to overcome that and do what is right for the American people and national and economic security.","word.count":949,"sep11":4.60393258426966,"years":2006.46348314607,"days":4081,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0201150268732564,"Topic 2":0.134330652106712,"Topic 3":0.486690385472969,"Topic 4":0.0205014855604282,"Topic 5":0.187949271870195,"Topic 6":0.0152720211013294,"Topic 7":0.0028662716803972,"Topic 8":0.120455225888984,"Topic 9":0.00779536856226318,"Topic 10":0.00402429088346655},{"id":"10419950073833","body":"John Glenn: The question occurs on amendment No. 5078, as amended.

In 1997, as Attorney General of Kentucky, I established the Prescription Drug Abuse Task Force in order to examine the problem. Among the Task Force's accomplishments was the establishment of KASPER, the Kentucky All Schedule Prescription Electronic Reporting System. KASPER was designed to stop the practice of ``doctor shopping,'' where abusers and dealers of illegally obtained prescription drugs visit multiple physicians in order to obtain multiple prescriptions. The success of KASPER has been impressive. In fact the program has been so successful that the Government Accounting Office described it as one of the Nation's best prescription drug abuse monitoring systems. The result has been that it is now more difficult for people to fill multiple or fraudulent prescriptions in the Bluegrass State. However, ``Doctor Shoppers'' have circumvented KASPER by traveling to one of the seven States surrounding Kentucky.

Unfortunately, due to political maneuvers by its opponents, the enactment of this critical legislation is being blocked. This is one of the most important pieces of legislation to be considered during the 109th Congress. Why is this legislation so important? Because despite the fact that 23 States require a minor to receive parental consent prior to obtaining an abortion, these important laws are being violated. Today, minors, with the assistance of adults who are not their parents, are being transported across State lines to receive abortions without obtaining parental consent. We must end this circumvention of State laws and, more importantly, the consequences such actions have on life. S. 403 would make it a Federal offense to help a minor cross lines for the purpose of obtaining an abortion, unless it is needed to save the life of the minor. Its enactment is critical, and we cannot allow its opponents to continue to stall needlessly its progress.

Yet the man I honor today has made the ultimate sacrifice for neither kin nor kind. Earnell Luster is a former Marine and a great American. As a lifelong resident of Minneapolis, MN, he exemplified the role of a Good Samaritan within his community. Mr. Luster sacrificed his own life for the sake of another, and his bravery and courage makes him a hero. On February 15, 2007, Mr. Luster was walking by an apartment building in south Minneapolis when he came across two women who were being repeatedly beaten by a male attacker. Being the man he was, Mr. Luster could not walk away from what he was witnessing. He sprang into action by demanding the attacker halt his assault upon the women. By doing so, he gave the women enough time to escape their attacker. Tragically, the attacker turned his anger on Mr. Luster and delivered several blows to his head that proved to be fatal. That evening, in an act of true selflessness, Earnell Luster gave his life for another. His actions that evening exemplify the life he lived. As a well- respected elder in his church and within his community, Mr. Luster lived a life full of joy, duty, and great conviction. His service to the Marines in the mid-1970s demonstrates the strength of his character. Mr. Luster enjoyed life, especially the opportunities that he had to go fishing with his twin brother Earnest. Earnell Luster's tragic death is evidence that crime can affect each one of us. Our commitment to fighting crime must not ebb and flow with the statistics. My thoughts and prayers remain with Earnell's twin brother Earnest, his mother Lorraine Scott, and his entire family. Mr. Luster's selfless act of bravery earns him a place in the hearts of Minnesotans and Americans everywhere.","word.count":315,"sep11":5.87921348314607,"years":2007.73876404494,"days":4535,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.178351934808025,"Topic 2":0.27719212060588,"Topic 3":0.0808001166580086,"Topic 4":0.00769798664809357,"Topic 5":0.304464032857429,"Topic 6":0.0039326309231703,"Topic 7":0.00574159784999385,"Topic 8":0.0367347120126135,"Topic 9":0.0767208816747239,"Topic 10":0.028363985962062},{"id":"11020080023470","body":"Ted Poe: Madam Speaker, she was 8 years old. She was asleep in her own room, in her bed dreaming about whatever little girls dream about. She thought she was safe in her home. Suddenly she was awakened by the demon from the night. Patrick Kennedy of Louisiana was on top of her, having his way with her, this petite little angel. Kennedy was someone the little girl supposedly could trust; after all, he was her stepfather. This little girl was raped. So violent was the rape she fainted and the next thing she remembered she woke up in an ambulance speeding to Children's Hospital. Official court records state, ``When police arrived, they found the victim on her bed wearing a T-shirt and wrapped in a bloody blanket. She was bleeding profusely from the vaginal area. The victim was transported to Children's Hospital. An expert in pediatric forensic medicine testified that the victim's injuries were the most severe he had ever seen from a sexual assault in his years of practice. A laceration to the left wall of the vagina separated her cervix from the back of her vagina, causing her rectum to protrude into the vaginal structure. The injuries required her to have emergency surgery.'' The little girl survived this attack by the barbarian and lives, even though she has been sentenced to a life of mental torture, physical pain and emotional trauma that she may not ever recover from. Her physical scars will never disappear. The child rapist was tried under Louisiana's law that specifically allows for the death penalty for criminals that choose to rape the most innocent among us, children. The law was passed by the legislature, signed by the Governor and is the wish of the people of Louisiana. A jury of 12 citizens heard the facts and they all agreed that Kennedy should die for his decision to rape his daughter. Several other states, including Texas, have the death penalty as a possible punishment for child rapists. This case has been reviewed by numerous courts, and has taken 5 years to reach our Supreme Court. In a decision this week by Justice Anthony Kennedy--no relation--the Supreme Court said the Louisiana law is just too severe and overruled the will of the people of Louisiana and a unanimous jury when he imposed his own moral code saying no one can be executed under these circumstances unless the villain also kills the child, otherwise it is a violation of the cruel and unusual provision of the United States Constitution. Although the jury was unanimous in ordering the death penalty, the Supreme Court split in its decision 5-4 with the majority siding with the evil-doer. Justice Kennedy focused on the fact that the victim survived the assault as the reason not to execute the rapist. In other words, the defendant got a break because the little girl had the will to survive. When I was on the trial bench in Texas, I had a rape victim once tell me that rape was a fate worse than death. In the eyes of this little girl, she probably agrees. When the ``cruel and unusual'' phrase was put in the Constitution, it was put there and based on constitutional history to outlaw torture and maiming of criminals. As history reflects, States decided what was appropriate punishment based upon these guidelines. The five justices who sided with the rapist don't seem to have lived in the real world or have real life experiences. They don't seem to provide justice for victims, only leniency for criminal defendants. I spent 22 years on the felony trial bench in Texas and heard over 20,000 cases. The Constitution was the basis for every decision I made. I saw those charged with the worst acts people can commit, and I saw the brutalized victims of crime. I only mention this experience because trial judges see the world as it really is, not how we wish and hope it to be. Trial judges see real people every day. Unfortunately, eight of our nine Supreme Court justices do not have the benefit of this experience and have never been a trial judge and seen the effects of crime on people. They have spent much of their time in elite ivory palaces as law school professors and appellate judges removed from the world, second-guessing legislatures, trial judges and juries. I doubt if Justice Kennedy has ever been to Louisiana or talked to a rape victim or a rapist, or a jury, for that matter. Now Justice Kennedy says the verdict of death is just too cruel and unusual for us that live in a sophisticated society to allow. His ruling is a misinterpretation of the Constitution. Justice Alito said in his dissent that the death penalty laws should be allowed for child rape ``if they reflect society's evolving standards of decency.'' The State of Louisiana set the evolving standard for child rapists in Louisiana, and said leave our children alone or face the death penalty. Society's standard was trumped by five black-robed justices who want it their way. They are wrong. And that's just the way it is.","word.count":857,"sep11":6.96629213483146,"years":2008.82584269663,"days":4922,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.137425486012183,"Topic 2":0.127272711168329,"Topic 3":0.0290357061569887,"Topic 4":0.0836954062643066,"Topic 5":0.0206401965291912,"Topic 6":0.173822811370267,"Topic 7":0.00816631144529833,"Topic 8":0.36913926843634,"Topic 9":0.0326476295245352,"Topic 10":0.0181544730925622},{"id":"11020070014466","body":"Ken Calvert: Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote A recorded vote was ordered.","word.count":327,"sep11":5.73876404494382,"years":2007.59831460674,"days":4485,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.299466404255329,"Topic 2":0.162446081045126,"Topic 3":0.00868837354836483,"Topic 4":0.0397114885578344,"Topic 5":0.0119906920988715,"Topic 6":0.00585137313759412,"Topic 7":0.412560963852413,"Topic 8":0.0349301147082904,"Topic 9":0.0172430977313588,"Topic 10":0.00711141106481912},{"id":"10619990039210","body":"Nick Smith: Mr. Speaker, as conflict rages in the Middle East and the world's attention is drawn to the crisis, it is vital that we do not forget other peoples around the world who suffer extreme violence.

Together with the ingenuity and determination of the American people, these resources have formed the basis of our prosperity. They have given us the opportunity to feed our people, power our industry, create our medicines, and defend our borders--and we have a responsibility to be good stewards of our heritage. In recent decades, however, rapid technological advances and population growth have greatly enhanced our ability to have an impact on our surroundings--and we do not always pause to contemplate the consequences of our actions. Far too often, our short-sighted decisions cause the greatest harm to the very people who are least able to influence them--future generations. We have a moral obligation to represent the interests of those who have no voice in today's decisions--our children and grandchildren. We have a responsibility to see that they inherit a productive and livable world that allows their families to enjoy the same or greater opportunities than we ourselves have enjoyed. Those of us who still believe in the American Dream will settle for no less. Those who say that we cannot afford both a strong economy and a healthy environment are ignoring the fact that the two are inextricably linked. Our economy will not remain strong for long if we continue to consume renewable resources faster than they can be replenished, or nonrenewable resources faster than we can develop substitutes; America's fishing and timber-dependent communities will not survive for long if we destroy our fisheries and our forests. Whether the subject is deficit spending or the stewardship of our fisheries, the issue is the same: we should not pursue a strategy of short-term gain that will harm future generations. Senators Henry Jackson and Ed Muskie, and Congressman John Dingell understood this back in 1969 when they joined together to work for passage of the National Environmental Policy Act. At its heart, the National Environmental Policy Act is about our relationship with the natural world, and about our relationship with future generations. For the first time, the National Environmental Policy Act made explicit the widely-held public sentiment that we should live in harmony with nature and make decisions that account for future generations as well as for today. It declared that the Federal Government should work in concert with State and local governments and the citizens of this great Nation ``to create and maintain conditions under which man and nature can exist in productive harmony, and fulfill the social, economic, and other requirements of present and future generations of Americans.'' Over the past 25 years, America has made great progress in protecting the environment. The air is cleaner in many places than it was, and we no longer have rivers that catch on fire. And yet, this year in Milwaukee, more than 100 people died from drinking contaminated water, and many of our surface waters are still not fit for fishing and swimming. One in four Americans still lives near a toxic dump and almost as many breathe air that is unhealthy. In order to continue the progress that we have made and adequately provide for future generations, my Administration is ushering in a new era of common sense reforms. We are bringing together Americans from all walks of life to find new solutions to protect our health, improve our Nation's stewardship of natural resources, and provide lasting economic opportunities for ourselves and for our children. We are reinventing environmental programs to make them work better and cost less. My Administration is ushering in a new era of environmental reforms in many ways.

The detailed analysis showed that by reversing the decline of the Salton Sea and reviving it as an attractive environmental and recreational location, that this could, by the estimate of the economist who prepared the report, add to the cash flow of the region as much as $1 billion a year. Now, this just astounded all of us who had looked at it, and I think Sonny, because of his own keen interest in recreational and economic development which he had demonstrated during his period as mayor, was not as surprised as some of the rest of us at what the potential was. Essentially, what this report said, and we will be making a great deal of use of it, is that the economic potential of activities related to a living and vital Salton Sea is probably equivalent to that of the agriculture which is the world's most productive that surrounds the Salton Sea. This is something that we will probably be spending more time investigating and bringing forth, but we owe this to Sonny's instincts as much as anything else.

To accomplish this, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, of which I am the chairman and Senator Baucus is the ranking member, will hold oversight hearings next year on the Corps' historical and current performance as it relates to the application of Ability to Pay provisions of the Water Resource Development Act.","word.count":103,"sep11":-2.03932584269663,"years":1999.8202247191,"days":1716,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0463530281986517,"Topic 2":0.359225884351976,"Topic 3":0.0622756573871065,"Topic 4":0.00469000568942023,"Topic 5":0.0269395607663041,"Topic 6":0.295110990657175,"Topic 7":0.115901601257016,"Topic 8":0.0678021191645697,"Topic 9":0.0187963038388727,"Topic 10":0.00290484868890932},{"id":"10720010064667","body":"Fritz Hollings: Without objection, it is so ordered","word.count":167,"sep11":0.00561797752808989,"years":2001.86516853933,"days":2444,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.471322110631462,"Topic 2":0.263050574590278,"Topic 3":0.0749872026580402,"Topic 4":0.0719652829160673,"Topic 5":0.0141677778953629,"Topic 6":0.0116336960691883,"Topic 7":0.0204496429828867,"Topic 8":0.0139541525460053,"Topic 9":0.037160046160441,"Topic 10":0.0213095135502679},{"id":"10619990042482","body":"Billy Tauzin: Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 1999, and under a previous order of the House, the following Members will be recognized for 5 minutes each.","word.count":265,"sep11":-1.8876404494382,"years":1999.97191011236,"days":1770,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.121479298484955,"Topic 2":0.360374529976773,"Topic 3":0.0740930314253858,"Topic 4":0.311635810786507,"Topic 5":0.0688312297471628,"Topic 6":0.0114339571466144,"Topic 7":0.00327137505533087,"Topic 8":0.0107426351413392,"Topic 9":0.014867018754665,"Topic 10":0.0232711134812682},{"id":"10519980044692","body":"Daniel Coats: Mr. President, I thank you for trading places with me so that I could come down and make remarks regarding the nomination. First of all, I want to commend the Senator for conducting what I think is an informative and factual and civil debate on this very important nomination. We have over the past several years had some very controversial Surgeon General discussions and debates on this floor. The previous Surgeon General, Joycelyn Elders, was controversial, to say the least, and resigned after one of her more controversial actions. Then, subsequent to that, one of the nominees for that position failed to achieve majority support in the U.S. Senate and withdrew his name. So that is the position that has been open for some time. Earlier, Mr. President, a speaker on the floor said that those who oppose this nomination never mentioned the experience and the qualifications and the life experiences of Dr. Satcher--his help for children, women, and the poor and disadvantaged. That is not true, at least in my experience, having been in the Chair for the last hour and a half. I think each speaker I have heard has acknowledged Dr. Satcher's fairly remarkable life experience in terms of providing help to people; in terms of dedicating his life to advancing the cause of medicine. He is an engaging person. He is a fine person with a history of achievements at the institutions for which he has worked. My personal meetings with him in my office have been cordial and informative, and his presentation before the Labor and Human Resources Committee on which I sit was also one of cordiality and civility. But, Mr. President, those are not just the qualifications for someone to occupy the position of Surgeon General. Cordiality and life experiences in the ability to be, as someone said and I have said on previous occasions, the Nation's doctor are important qualifications but there are other criteria by which I believe it is important Members make the determination. I cannot speak for other Members. They can and will speak for themselves. However, I can state to the Senate and to the people I represent why I intend to cast my vote tomorrow in opposition to the nomination of Dr. Satcher. It is based on the committee hearings we have had. It is based on the answers to questions that I personally proposed to Dr. Satcher. My opposition is based on his answers to some of the questions I have raised during meetings which I have conducted in my office. Other Members have spoken on issues that have been of concern to me--his involvement and his role in the AIDS trials in Africa, his support for needle exchange programs, his inability to state clearly the relative importance of abstinence by children and avoiding drug use by teens. I will leave further details of those issues to others. The Senator from Missouri has already touched on some of those, as have others. Each of those matters could be potentially disqualifying. The accumulation of those matters could be disqualifying. But for me ultimately my opposition to the nominee is based on his support for a practice that I consider indefensible, partial-birth abortion, a practice which we now know is brutal killing of a living child who has been partially delivered from the mother. Some have claimed that the nominee has not in fact stated that he opposes legislation to ban this practice, and he made that statement to me. But I need to read from the following exchange of the nominee with my office as was printed in the hearing record and available on the committee's web site. Dr. Satcher's brief but critical reply: Mr. President, I cannot support someone who supports that position. Some have claimed that they expect the nominee won't do anything to further advance the President's position on this question. But it is precisely on a matter so crucial to defining who we are as a nation and who we are as a people that I expect, and the qualifying criteria for me, is that our Nation's doctor show some independence and integrity on this question. I can understand why a nominee feels compelled to ``support the President's position.'' But this is a matter of such fundamental importance, of such defining importance that I believe each has to speak their own moral conscience on the matter and come to their own conclusion regardless of the political consequences or any other implications. Whether or not you will be an advocate or not an advocate for a position is not the criteria. The question is, what is your position on this, the most critical of all and the most defining of all issues, the issue of life itself. By supporting a procedure that I personally consider infanticide, this nominee has in fact joined forces with those who would create questions about whether or not that is the case, who supports without qualification a radical procedure that is not justifiable in any case except to save the life of the mother, and we have heard testimony from witness after witness, medical provider after medical provider, expert after expert, that it has never been the case that it is necessary to utilize the procedure of partial-birth abortion to save the life of the mother. It is a grotesque practice. It has been described in this Chamber. It is not justifiable for any medical reasons, and yet that is the reason why it is defined here. Mr. President, we need a Nation's doctor who unequivocally stands for, speaks for, advocates life itself, the sacredness of life itself and who will not hedge that qualification with an answer that simply says, I support the position of the President. Whether that person privately supports that position or not is irrelevant. That person is a public figure. The Surgeon General is the doctor to whom the Nation looks for advice and counsel on medical matters. He speaks, he advocates for those issues, and that someone says on this issue, I simply support the President's position, is unacceptable to this Senator because the President's position is unacceptable to this Senator. So for that reason, Mr. President, I oppose this nomination and intend to do so when we vote tomorrow. I yield the floor.","word.count":1051,"sep11":-3.67977528089888,"years":1998.1797752809,"days":1132,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0399245475103399,"Topic 2":0.41463104572161,"Topic 3":0.0251348307468597,"Topic 4":0.0493310123658996,"Topic 5":0.02242382940911,"Topic 6":0.0121773290579261,"Topic 7":0.261944521539804,"Topic 8":0.0277489356974426,"Topic 9":0.134307259108618,"Topic 10":0.0123766888423899},{"id":"10920060008256","body":"John Larson: Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of my Democratic colleagues to offer a motion to instruct the House conferees on the tax cut reconciliation conference committee. This motion has two simple yet important provisions. First, it closes over $5 billion in unneeded tax loopholes and subsidies for oil companies. It eliminates the ``last in/first out,'' LIFO, accounting method for oil companies, which amounts to $4.3 billion over the next 10 years. It prohibits oil companies from writing off costs associated with oil and gas exploration, which is about $292 million over the next 10 years. It limits the foreign tax credit that companies receive for the taxes they pay to oil-producing countries. This rollback amounts to, for oil companies, a mere $540 million a year and $135 million each quarter. To put this in appropriate perspective, this represents approximately 1.6 percent of Exxon's first-quarter profits in 2006 alone. Second, it ends the extension of lower capital gains and dividends tax rates. We offered this motion last week. The distinguished gentleman from Washington State put forward the amendment in the motion because of the way that Americans are being hit this time both at the gas pump and again because we hoped that the other side would join us in this effort. Unfortunately, only nine Republicans voted for the motion, and it failed 190-232. We offer this again because the American people simply cannot understand why their government would hand billions in tax breaks and subsidies to an oil industry that by all measures is enjoying an unprecedented level of success. In fact, last week, President Bush discussed his plan to address the rising price of gas and oil. During his remarks the President stated, ``Record oil prices and large cash flows also mean that Congress has got to understand that these energy companies do not need unnecessary tax breaks. I am looking forward to Congress to take about $2 billion of these tax breaks out of the budget over a 10-year period of time. Cash flows are up, taxpayers do not need to be paying for certain of these expenses on behalf of energy companies.'' Now, if the President of the United States can call for this, it just seems logical to those of us on this side of the aisle that Congress ought to be able to join with the other body. This body ought to embrace what the Senate has already done and concluded, and be in harmony with the Senate and the President of the United States.

The oil companies are trying to have it exactly the way they have had it in the past. They have developed an amendment that is very seductive by saying that you can have offshore drilling with the concurrence of the State if gasoline reaches $5 a gallon. What they have not told you is that if the price of gas goes up to $5 a gallon, of which the oil companies are making money hand over fist, they are going to utilize that to perpetuate the myth that they need to drill off the coast of a State like Florida, when, in fact, what they have not told you is that the oil companies already have under lease, which has not been drilled, 33 million acres offshore. The oil companies also have another 31 million acres onshore that have not been drilled. And the myth that they perpetuate, now using the fright of $5-a-gallon gas, is that we have to have more supply and therefore we have to go offshore. This is the seductive red herring of this amendment which was offered by a Senator whose State, Louisiana, has a big oil industry that drills off of Louisiana, where, in fact, there are deposits of oil. But when you get to a State such as Florida, there have been several dry holes, and the geology shows very little oil, plus we have the adverse interests. Now, why do we have to keep going through this drill over and over? It is because the oil companies are insatiable. Do we not remember what we did just a year and a half ago, where the oil interests wanted to drill toward Tampa, FL, 2 million acres? We worked out a compromise-- which wasn't 2 million acres, it was 8.3 million acres--but we kept it further to the south, away from the military training and testing area, where you cannot put oil rigs on the surface of the water, where we have our largest training and testing area in the world for our U.S. military. That is where we are training pilots for the F-22, where we train all of the pilots for the new Joint Strike Fighter being developed. That is where we are testing some of the most sophisticated weapons. That is because we have the area that is restricted airspace. As you are shooting that live ordnance and you are testing in your research and development of weapons systems, you cannot have oil rigs down there on the surface of the Gulf of Mexico. We etched that into law. But here we go again. Having gone through this and having the oil industry have 33 million acres that is already available for lease but has not been drilled, they want to make an exception and are using the scare of this $4 gas--maybe going to $5 gas--in order to do that. That is wrong, and we ought to put a stop to it. Here is the greatest wrong it perpetuates. What it does is it keeps us in the same old mindset where we stay married to oil. The emphasis is drill, drill, drill to solve the problem, as evidenced by $5 gas, when, in fact, that is not going to solve our problem. What is going to solve our problem is using our technology to go to alternative fuels. What is going to solve our problem is to go to renewables. What is going to solve our problem is going to be to have a new President of the United States who says he is going to commit to making the United States independent of foreign oil, of which we now import 60 percent for our daily consumption from places such as Nigeria, Venezuela, and the Persian Gulf. So what we have to do is change the mindset of the old way of doing things, which this amendment by the Senator from Louisiana is suggestive of; that is, to go to the alternative fuels, to go to a serious research and development program for a new engine on down the line, to encourage the increase of miles per gallon. In Japan, they are driving cars that get 50 miles per gallon. In Europe, they are driving cars, on a fleet average, that are getting in the area of 40 miles per gallon. Why can't the United States--if we had the political will-- change our way of doing things as oil guzzlers through our consumption in our personal vehicles? We can if we have the political will.","word.count":763,"sep11":6.84831460674157,"years":2008.70786516854,"days":4880,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.254628472660175,"Topic 2":0.271774941668545,"Topic 3":0.00403224135883112,"Topic 4":0.327205267459663,"Topic 5":0.00801895444302314,"Topic 6":0.00208062765229279,"Topic 7":0.00437344317013531,"Topic 8":0.00388794528357312,"Topic 9":0.120354252170031,"Topic 10":0.00364385413373017},{"id":"10820040026236","body":"Anthony Weiner: Mr. Speaker, as a nonlawyer and observing that there are many young people in the gallery today, this is actually an instructive debate that we are having for the second time in 2 weeks. Last week, with the sponsorship of Republicans and Democrats alike, we paid tribute to John Marshall. John Marshall was perhaps the most important jurist in the history of the United States, because despite what many people think, in the Constitution of the United States nowhere does it say who will settle disputes between the legislature, the executive, and the courts. What if each of the three branches come to a different conclusion? Well, John Marshall, in 1803, 201 years ago, said the courts are going to decide. The courts are going to be the final arbiter of what is constitutional and what is not. For 200 years, that has served as the way that we have operated, virtually unquestioned. It was even unquestioned in the year 2000 when, in the Constitution of the United States, it clearly says that Congress has the right to choose electors, and the Supreme Court took that upon itself. We Democrats, although we were very concerned about it, jurists, scholars of jurisprudence said it was a terrible decision, but no one says it should not be the courts to make that decision. I would say to the gentlewoman or anyone who supports this bill, if not the courts then who? Who is going to make the decision about the constitutionality of this law? We are left with essentially three choices. One, we can say the State courts will make that final determination. But what if we have two State courts that are in conflict? Who is going to resolve that dispute? Two, we can say that it will be the legislature that will always decide these things, and we have 50 different legislative interpretations, or the legislature will change every 2 years, changing interpretation of the law. And the third choice is just anyone can choose whatever interpretation that they like. Before we choose anything but the courts, before we support this, let us remember something here. The courts are where the minority goes to have their views heard. That one person who is standing outside a movie theater; the courts are where that one person goes who wants to protect his right to bear arms against a legislature that is overzealous, where the one person goes who has burnt a flag and wants to go to find out if what he has done is constitutional. There are dozens and dozens of places in society where the majority rules. The court is the only place we go to protect our constitutional rights. So to the sponsors of the bill, to the sponsors of the rule, I ask them, if not John Marshall's way, if not judicial review, if not the Supreme Court of the United States of America, then who will it be who will decide what is constitutional and what is not?","word.count":502,"sep11":2.93539325842697,"years":2004.79494382022,"days":3487,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0535100385890686,"Topic 2":0.0145531236315369,"Topic 3":0.00521603108454082,"Topic 4":0.650256507153821,"Topic 5":0.00266237087558467,"Topic 6":0.0027412763537234,"Topic 7":0.233283748437634,"Topic 8":0.0205303848463401,"Topic 9":0.00697089500481871,"Topic 10":0.0102756240229319},{"id":"10820040001172","body":"Sander Levin: Mr. Chairman, the majority says ``This is not the way'' when you stand in the way.

Congress must not play politics with the full faith and credit of the United States. We must extend the debt limit within the next 5 weeks or the consequences will be catastrophic. If we fail to raise the debt limit by March 1, the United States will default on its financial obligations for the first time in the history of our Republic. As a result, bondholders will not receive the payments they are due. Social security recipients and veterans may not receive their monthly benefits, and long-term interest rates will increase across the board. Interest rate increases mean that the United States will waste billions of dollars on increased debt service costs, ironically, making it even more difficult to balance the budget. But perhaps most important, higher interest rates mean that the millions of Americans with any kind of loan--mortgages, car loans, even credit card balances--can expect higher monthly payments for years to come. I would urge my colleagues to heed the words of former Treasury Secretary James A. Baker, who stated in 1985, ``It would be an absolute disgrace if the United States defaulted for the first time in its over- 200-year history. Any default will have swift and severe implications both domestically and internationally.'' On November 9, 1995, six former Secretaries of the Treasury, who served in Democratic and Republican Presidential administrations, wrote, ``We urge that prompt action be taken either to raise the debt limit permanently * * * or that a sufficient short-term increase be enacted to allow the debate over priorities to proceed in an orderly manner without impairing market confidence in our Nation's commitment to discharge its obligations''. Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, has written, ``a failure to make timely payment of interest and principal on our obligations for the first time would put a cloud over our securities that would not dissipate for many years''. Furthermore, former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul Volker wrote that ``The appropriate approach, short of early agreement on a comprehensive budget program * * * [is] raising the debt ceiling so that authorized expenditures--including payment of interest on Treasury debt--can be made in a timely fashion.''

This legislation authorizes $601.4 billion for defense programs in FY 2009, including $70 billion in emergency funds authorized specifically to support operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. This is funding that is critical to our nation's defense, as well as to the troops serving so valiantly in the wars being waged on two fronts. Thanks in a large part to the leadership of Chairman Skelton, this legislation provides greater funding than had been requested by the President for equipment depleted by the war in Iraq, including new combat vehicles, new battle gear for the Army National Guard and reserves, military pay raises, and shipbuilding. H.R. 5658 authorizes $25.4 billion for defense health-care programs, and blocks the president's plan to raise user fees for programs such as Tricare and deductibles for service members and military retirees. This legislation will also authorize an increase of 7,000 active-duty Army personnel, and provide for 5,000 more Marine Corps personnel than current levels. This legislation also provides for a 3.5 percent pay raise for active duty military, rolls back proposed benefit reductions to spousal benefits, and increases funding for military housing upgraded for bases like Fort Bragg, North Carolina, located in my district. Mr. Chairman this is a good bill for our troops. It is our duty, our charge as members of this body, to ensure that those who protect and defend our nation in this all-volunteer army receive the best health care, pay, and living conditions that we can provide for them. We owe this to them.

Pilot Shaw has landed his plane on the aircraft carrier and said ``mission accomplished,'' and the carrier sank. This resolution, looking at a 10-year window, ignores the disturbing trends of the last 5 years during the Bush Republican Presidency. Total poverty has increased for 4 consecutive years, and more than 37 million people are living in poverty today. Child poverty has been on the rise for 5 straight years, and 13 million children are struggling in poverty today. Real wages for low-income workers have been stagnant for 5 consecutive years. It is time for the minimum wage to be raised, but the Republicans don't care to represent poor people, only rich. Nearly one in three poor single women are not working and not receiving TANF assistance, and fewer than half of the families eligible for TANF receive it. Child care funding under the Republicans is $11 billion short of what CBO estimates the States need. The administration funneled $2 billion alone to religious organizations, trusting in this faith-based stuff, and the GAO has found the Bush faith-based initiative lacks accountability and safeguards against discrimination. And this has been, as Congressman Shaw would claim, the most successful social policy in history. What is it, sir, that you don't understand about the word ``failure''? Instead of engaging in this political public relations charade, we should be working on a bipartisan basis to confront realities of poverty in this country. We should move ourselves into the present and work to ensure that we provide States with the resources they need to move families out of poverty, instead of wasting time defining marriage. We should focus on real programs that help families improve their lives. We need to improve their lives, expand the Earned Income Tax Credit, raise the minimum wage, increase access to Medicaid and Medicare, CHIP and food stamps. We need to provide work supports such as sufficient funding for children, remove the barriers to employment, provide education and training opportunities and get to work and solve the problem of poverty, instead of making tax cuts for the very rich and ignoring the middle class and doing it on the backs of the poor. That is the Republican way. The Democrats' way is to help everybody in this country rise out of poverty.","word.count":201,"sep11":3.95224719101124,"years":2005.81179775281,"days":3849,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.147957611393543,"Topic 2":0.0205671210039628,"Topic 3":0.00296296117322257,"Topic 4":0.00840540650283435,"Topic 5":0.00146397359575971,"Topic 6":0.0038296789266211,"Topic 7":0.10632740859896,"Topic 8":0.012512807264918,"Topic 9":0.69389385612128,"Topic 10":0.00207917541889867},{"id":"10519970012176","body":"Jerry Lewis: To the Congress of the United States: In accordance with the requirements of section 809 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended , I transmit herewith the annual report of the National Institute of Building Sciences for fiscal year 1996.

I have the greatest respect for the gentleman from New York , the chairman of the Committee on Rules. He is put in a very difficult position today. He has a tough job, Mr. Speaker. He is put in the position of presenting a rule to this body on a bill that he is vigorously, vigorously opposed to. So I have always respected him for the hard job he has, but even more so today because of the position that he has found himself in. I also have the greatest respect for some of the proponents of this legislation. The gentleman from Alaska , chairman of the Committee on Resources, is a very effective leader in the House of Representatives. He believes fervently in this issue, and he is entitled to his beliefs and his opinions and has worked very effectively for the legislation, and I have great respect for his viewpoint. However, I do oppose the bill and oppose the rule, Mr. Speaker, because I do not believe the American people have enough facts about this issue. I do not believe the American people are prepared to have their national legislature move on a decision concerning Puerto Rican statehood. Now, there are people who have risen on the floor today and previously, who said this is not a statehood bill, but I would submit to my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, that this is very much a statehood bill. And this is the reason--as the chairman has previously stated, Puerto Rico has voted previously, very recently, on the issue of statehood, and they rejected the idea of statehood; 1993, I believe, was the latest plebiscite. This bill, if passed by the House of Representatives, and if enacted by the Senate and signed by the President, would say to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, ``Vote again, you did not get it right last time.'' If Puerto Rico votes for statehood with 50 percent plus 1, a bare majority, then the Congress of the United States will have to decide the issue to decide. We must vote on a bill to decide whether to grant the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico their statehood. However, in this referendum that is proposed by this bill, if Puerto Ricans vote once again for commonwealth status, this bill says, ``Wait a minute, you didn't get it right. We will let that decision stand, but just for a little while. And after 10 years you must vote again and you must vote again and you must vote again until you get it right. And the right decision is statehood.'' So I would say that the bill is designed to eventually get a decision by the Puerto Rican people for statehood. And because of that, I say that enactment of the bill would inevitably put us down the path to admitting Puerto Rico as the 51st State, and that is a serious, serious decision. This is a major decision. Adding a star to the United States flag is a major decision for Americans to make. It is a serious matter which Congress and the American people need to have a full understanding about. I do not think the American people know this issue is out there. When I went home to my constituents, they had no idea that Congress was about to vote on a bill which will inevitably lead to statehood. So for that reason, I oppose the rule. I respect the chairman for bringing it forward, but I think that if we as a body want to take the position today that, having had this debate this morning, this issue is not ripe for a decision and we need to go back and have a further national conversation about this, I think the correct decision is to vote ``no'' on the rule. And that will be my vote, Mr. Speaker.","word.count":146,"sep11":-4.61797752808989,"years":1997.24157303371,"days":798,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.109565990824209,"Topic 2":0.340146688608972,"Topic 3":0.193754652232135,"Topic 4":0.034034156682248,"Topic 5":0.0836873963187052,"Topic 6":0.200512007077966,"Topic 7":0.00867909991810054,"Topic 8":0.0127930523287977,"Topic 9":0.0118859831652621,"Topic 10":0.00494097284360369},{"id":"10820040006217","body":"Sheila Jackson-Lee: Madam Speaker, I rise today with great fear over the direction that the Republican Party and this Administration is taking our great nation. My concern is based primarily on the national budget which was just voted on. The Nussle budget clearly did not improve upon the severely flawed Bush Administration budget. The needs of average Americans were still ignored. The interests of a wealthy few outweighed the needs of an entire nation in this budget. I say this not out of partisanship, but from a statement of the facts. I want to highlight a few areas in this budget that are particularly egregious. This President and the majority party in this body have spent so much time talking about their record on education and as hard as I try I cannot see what they have to be proud of. It is one thing to address areas of critical need with rhetoric, but to advocate a policy and then not fund it sufficiently is plain irresponsible. At the top of the list of my concerns is the No Child Left Behind Act and the fact that it has become an unfunded mandate. The House Republican resolution provides at least $8.8 billion less than the $34.3 billion authorized for education programs under the ``No Child Left Behind'' Act for 2005. The CBC alternative budget is the only one that fully funds the ``No Child Left Behind'' Act of 2005. Without this program being fully funded low funding millions of elementary and secondary school students are left without the services Congress and the President promised just two years ago. For example, the Republican budget denies Title I services to 2.4 million students who quality under the Act. But the irresponsibility does not end with No Child Left Behind. For the third straight year the Republican Party has frozen the funding level for Pell Grants. Both the Republicans and the President freeze the maximum Pell Grant award at the 2003 level of $4,050, with an average grant of $2,399. Such small Pell Grants make college unaffordable for millions of students: the College Board reports that tuition and fees at 4-year public colleges today average $4,694. In any market this gap would be hard to swallow, but with the current state of joblessness that the Republican Party's agenda has created it is near impossible for so many American families to send their children to college. I fear that this agenda if allowed to continue will cause a perpetual state where our American families aren't able to succeed. The CBC budget would ease the difficulty on the plethora of American families having problems funding their children's education. It guarantees almost $2 billion more for the Pell Grant, raising the maximum level to $4,500, an 11 percent increase over the maximum under the Republican Budget. In addition to this the CBC budget provides even more benefits to our education system. It adds a combined total of $18.7 billion to educational spending which will greatly reduce the stress placed on our educational system today. But education is not limited to elementary and secondary schools and colleges and universities. Education is a lifelong endeavor. And with that in mind the CBC budget proposes an additional $2 billion for Job Training, Vocational Education, and Adult Education. Such funding will provide countless Americans the ability to improve their lives, their families, their communities, and their nation. The Republican budget underfunds our education and our future. Our brave American veterans are another group who were outraged by the President's budget and will unfortunately be disappointed with the Republican House Budget. The majority party argues continuously about the greatness of our Armed Forces, and their right, but again it's just empty rhetoric on their part. Those brave men and women fighting on the front lines in our War Against Terror will come back home and find that the Republican Party looks at them differently once they become veterans. They are no longer treated as great heroes. Instead they are viewed as a nuisance and a way to cut the budget. Almost all veterans need some form of health care, some will need drastic care for the rest of their lives because of the sacrifice they made in war, but the Republican Party continues to turn a blind eye to their needs. On a bipartisan basis, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs recommended that $2.5 million more than the President's budget was needed to maintain vital health care programs for veterans. Nevertheless, the House Republican budget provides $1.3 billion less than what the Committee recommended for 2005. The CBC budget provides an extra $1.25 billion to meet the request of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. The entire Department of Veterans Affairs is going to suffer because of the Republican agenda. Over the next five years the money allocated to the Department of Veterans Affairs will not even be able to maintain these programs at their current levels. In 2007, the budget is $227 million less than what the Department of Veterans Affairs needs to keep pace with inflation. Over five years, the Republican budget cuts $1.6 billion from the total needed to maintain services at the 2004 level. I've heard from veterans groups throughout my district in Houston and I'm sure each Member of this body has heard from groups in their own district because veterans are one group that come from all parts of this nation. These brave veterans have told me their stories of how they are suffering now with the current state of veterans affairs. I am going to have trouble telling them that not only will things continue to stay bad but things will only continue to get worse. That is not what our returing soldiers from Iraq and Afghanistan should have to look forward to, a future where their needs are not only not provided for, but are in fact ignored. The CBC budget provides an extra $8.7 billion in total veterans spending. An increase that is sure to fix many of the aforementioned problems. Of that extra funding $3.6 billion will be dedicated to fund the Montgomery GI Bill. This program is, and has been, one of the most important veterans programs around, and I for one will not allow it to be underfunded. Finally, the CBC budget will give $2.5 billion and $25 billion over ten years to help eliminate the tax on disabled veterans known as concurrent receipts. While the Administration's tax cuts are doled out to the wealthiest Americans this budget will aid those who really need our help, our veterans. Education and Veterans Affairs make up only two areas where Republican budget fails Americans. The truth is there are many other programs and services vital to our nation that are at risk because of the Republican agenda. At this point, an average American may be asking why the Republican Party finds it necessary to cut so many fundamental programs. The answer is simple, yet disturbing; the majority party is cutting important programs in order to finance all their irresponsible tax cuts. They will continue to make the argument that tax cuts provide stimulus for our economy, but millions of unemployed Americans will tell you otherwise. In fact the Congressional Budget Office itself said ``tax legislation will probably have a net negative effect on saving, investment, and capital accumulation over the next 10 years.'' While the Republican Party continues its offensive for irresponsible tax policies they allow our national deficit to grow increasingly larger. The deficits are so large and their policies are so irresponsible that they won't even make deficit projections past 2009. It's clear that the Republican Party is hiding from the American people. This President and this majority in Congress have yet to advocate a fiscal policy that helps average Americans. Special interests have become king in this budget at the price of sound fiscal policies. The CBC budget will go a long way to solving this problem. Our goal is to help the common person not just the CEO. We want to protect the Average American who is struggling every day through these tough times just to get by. And this brings me to another key problem with the Republican Budget. In what direction are they taking Homeland Security? The CBC budget provides an additional $2.4 billion in Homeland Security funding. It provides an extra $900 million for First Responders including the COPS Program and Citizen Corps and provides an extra $566 million for Port Security grants and an additional $250 million for Rail Security. We must keep American citizens out of harm's way and the CBC budget provides us with the resources to do that. The truth about the budget is that a sound fiscal policy that funds needed programs is possible. The CBC Alternative Budget is an example of how we can get out of the quagmire that the Republican agenda has put this Nation in.","word.count":1485,"sep11":2.60112359550562,"years":2004.4606741573,"days":3368,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0824516166438872,"Topic 2":0.210259170023355,"Topic 3":0.0102786796964189,"Topic 4":0.417015992481365,"Topic 5":0.00775818481881495,"Topic 6":0.090796454533323,"Topic 7":0.00574120328732363,"Topic 8":0.103323667870571,"Topic 9":0.0344848332159768,"Topic 10":0.0378901974289653},{"id":"11020080016944","body":"John M.

It would replace those provisions with language requiring the Director of National Intelligence to submit to Congress regular updates of the National Intelligence Estimate with respect to Iran's nuclear capabilities, present and prospective. As offered in committee, section 1224 imposed a multiplicity of reporting requirements, including all sorts of data from the Department of Defense. Mr. Reyes offered a perfecting amendment culling out many of those requirements and calling for a new commitment to readiness throughout the world, particularly in the Middle East. Rather than proliferate reporting requirements, my amendment cuts to the heart of the matter, Iran's nuclear capabilities, and calls for regular, periodic reports. What it seeks is basic: a sober analysis of a gravely serious matter in a proven format, the National Intelligence Estimate. This report is gleaned from all 16 parts of our intelligence community, and the job of fusing that data, and drawing the right conclusions, is assigned to the National Intelligence Director, a position created by Congress by the unanimous recommendation of the 9/ 11 Commission. We need an assessment, but we need an assessment that is rigorous and objective, pulling no punches, analyzing seriously all issues surrounding nuclear weapons and fissile materials in Iran. And, fortunately, we don't have to invent that vehicle. It exists already in the form of the National Intelligence Estimate, like the NIE of last November, 2007. It satisfies this requirement. And my amendment ensures that this requirement continues to fulfilled, not ad hoc, but at regular intervals, for the benefit of Congress. My amendment simply places responsibility where it already rests by law and uses a reporting process that is well established. Why reinvent the wheel? The appropriate vehicle for an ongoing objective of analysis is an updated NIE, not an independent, redundant, parallel effort, overseen by DOD. There are many good reasons for having unity of command here, but one is simply this: By consolidating analysis in the NIE, we discourage the temptation to ``forum shop,'' look for agencies that will be favorably disposed. My amendment allows for many of the points of inquiry in the bill's existing language, including input from our allies. But it focuses the NIE on near- and mid-term implications rather than on speculative far- term projections, and it does not rush to a military response as a presupposition. My amendment leaves in place the bill's current requirement to provide Congress 15 days' written notice when major developments in the nuclear weapons program are detected. But the bill shifts that burden from the Secretary of Defense to the President. This amendment, the amendment I offer, is truly, Madam Chairman, a perfecting amendment. It improves the language of the bill, and it helps section 1224 fulfill its stated purpose. Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.","word.count":488,"sep11":6.86797752808989,"years":2008.72752808989,"days":4887,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.929901159393689,"Topic 2":0.0169778478914692,"Topic 3":0.00418426290356813,"Topic 4":0.0215052129898398,"Topic 5":0.00380435588515834,"Topic 6":0.00436067323575585,"Topic 7":0.00335590070016019,"Topic 8":0.00770592478831484,"Topic 9":0.0062162609571027,"Topic 10":0.00198840125494157},{"id":"10419950033540","body":"Charles Wilson: Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Burton] is recognized for 5 minutes.","word.count":390,"sep11":-6.37078651685393,"years":1995.48876404494,"days":174,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.776725562894449,"Topic 2":0.0402193955212574,"Topic 3":0.013259423747607,"Topic 4":0.0718927187984004,"Topic 5":0.00826090479181758,"Topic 6":0.0214175778990084,"Topic 7":0.0206605145641028,"Topic 8":0.0280888730789666,"Topic 9":0.0141457602509753,"Topic 10":0.00532926845341486},{"id":"10820030003076","body":"Bob Etheridge: Mr. Speaker, assault weapons will go back on American streets in 188 days. We pay a heavy toll at the hands of criminals, gangs, and terrorists. The average cost of a gunshot wound is more than $16,000 to treat. Treating severe gunshot injuries like wounds to the head or spinal cord can run well over $1 million. The direct medical costs for firearms or related injuries is $4 billion a year; $4 billion a year. Half of that is paid by us as taxpayers. I know that the police across this Nation want to make sure that we keep assault weapons off the streets. Mr. Speaker, when we see that we are cutting the money for the COPS program and yet allowing assault weapons back on the street, to me it does not make any sense. Since I have been talking about this every Tuesday, we are hearing from people around the Nation. What I am saying to the people of this country is you do have a voice, and you can call Members of Congress and the Senate to make sure that we are allowed to bring the bill up on the floor so we can vote for it. This is not the time to go backwards. In the last 10 years, we have seen certainly it come down as far as assault weapon killings. We have a report from the FBI. Before the ban went in place, one out of every five cops that were shot were shot with an assault weapon. Why should we go backwards? When we know that there might be a possibility of having terrorists here in this country, when we know that gangs and drug dealers, these are the guns of choice, why would we want assault weapons back on the street? Mr. Speaker, $4 billion a year in health costs. I can talk about my own son who was shot. He was shot in the head. His medical care has cost over $1 million already, and the total keeps going higher and higher. This is going on with so many people. There are things that we can prevent. We cannot prevent every shooting; we cannot. We cannot see to it that every police officer is being protected. But we can do a better job, and that is by renewing the assault weapons ban by September 13. Mr. Speaker, 10 years ago, before I came to Congress, I was here lobbying the Members of Congress to make sure we had an assault weapons bill passed. There are some that will say the assault weapons bill has not worked. Well, it has worked; but there are loopholes in it, and those loopholes are where the gun manufacturers are allowed to make copycats of the guns that were banned. One of the guns that everyone is watching on CNN and all of the other stations tonight is the Bushmaster, the guns that were used by the snipers in the D.C. area. That is a copycat. That is a gun that was originally banned. Yet the gun manufacturers allow these to have copycats and put back on our streets. Do we actually want on September 14 for anyone to be able to go into a gun store and buy an assault weapon? Is this what this Nation is coming to? Mr. Speaker, I am not for taking away the right of someone to own a gun. I happen to believe that if people want to own a gun, they have a right to own a gun. But assault weapons are made for killing machines. Assault weapons are made for our Army. When we see our police officers and they have to wear protective gear, assault weapons can go through that. One of the other things that a lot of people do not understand is, when we did the ban back 10 years ago, we cut back the amount of bullets in a clip, down to 10. On the Long Island Rail Road, the clips that were used by Collin Ferguson to do his killing and shooting of people had 15 bullets in the clip. And every one of those bullets made their mark. And he was able to get 30 rounds off and kill six people and injure 19. Hunters give animals a better chance of survival than we do with these large capacity clips. Our police officers are allowed to have these large capacity clips, our military are allowed to. And that is fine. I do not believe that our hunters need them, I do not believe that our ordinary citizens need those kind of clips. These are things that we should be doing. Those are good safety laws. Those are good gun safety laws. I hope that the American people will take up this challenge and demand that we are able to bring this vote up before September 13. It would be a shame to see assault weapons back on the street.","word.count":207,"sep11":1.51685393258427,"years":2003.37640449438,"days":2982,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.425964017886703,"Topic 2":0.275475966290629,"Topic 3":0.00839525893811106,"Topic 4":0.0358732843243122,"Topic 5":0.0074453502677871,"Topic 6":0.0652103165707162,"Topic 7":0.0113299804555574,"Topic 8":0.0102336265211339,"Topic 9":0.155199891138026,"Topic 10":0.00487230760702485},{"id":"10619990004470","body":"Ben Cardin: Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor one of our nation's most revered cultural treasures: the Library of Congress. This year marks the 200th year of the library's compilation of America's history and human knowledge. In this bicentennial year, I am honored to take a moment to extend my deep appreciation to Dr. James H. Billington, the Librarian of Congress. I would be remiss, Mr. Speaker, if I didn't also commend Dr. Billington's fine staff, especially Geraldine M. Otremba, Pamela J. Russell, Ralph Eubanks, Norma Baker, Peter Seligman, and Judy Schneider, who serve the Library so well and have been so helpful during my tenure in Congress. It is through their creative and dedicated efforts that our nation is reminded this year about the importance of libraries, and is encouraged to celebrate the uniqueness of their communities. The Library's historic architecture may be deceiving to some, but once inside its marble walls the building continues to stimulate and inspire all who visit. It is that inspiration, that re-connection with American culture, which is the focus behind one of the Library's key bicentennial programs, the Local Legacy Project. The Local Legacy Project was created to give hometown libraries, cultural institutions, and other groups, in concert with their United States Senator or United States Representative, an opportunity to document the unique customs and cultures that make us Americans. I think of the Local Legacy Project as a patchwork quilt of American communities; no two are exactly alike, but each is a true treasure. I am very pleased that the First Congressional District in Connecticut will be participating in the Library's Local Legacy Project with four projects of our own: The Legacy of Our Education will feature six historic and influencial institutions: American School for the Deaf, Trinity College, University of Connecticut School of Law, University of Hartford, Teaching Hospitals and St. Joseph's College; The Legacy of Our Natural Resources includes the Riverfront Recapture-- Connecticut River and Elizabeth Park Rose Garden; The Legacy of Our Proud Heritage includes the First Congressional District Foot Guard, Old State House, Mark Twain House, Harriet Beecher Stowe House, Noah Webster House, Oliver Ellsworth Homestead, Cheney Homestead, Warehouse Point Fife and Drum Corps, and the Eighth Connecticut Regiment Fife and Drum Corps; and The Legacy of the Creative Spirit includes the following organizations: Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford Stage, Bushnell Memorial Hospital, Hartford Symphony, and Real Art Ways. I am optimistic that our ``creative spirit'' will not be limited to our Legacy projects alone. One of the Library's other bicentennial programs includes the exhibition of its unparalleled collection of Thomas Jefferson materials, documents, books, drawings, and prints. I am hopeful that a collection of his works may make their way to Hartford, Connecticut, our state's capital, to be displayed. While much is taking place in communities across America to preserve our culture, I am pleased to have played a role in the preservation of our legislative culture here in the House of Representatives. As a former high school history teacher, I was heartened by the support I received from Dr. Billington and his staff last year as I worked to obtain passage of my History of the House Awareness and Preservation Act. This bill authorizes the Library of Congress to commission eminent historians to assemble a written history of the House. Presently, the Library is beginning the process by gathering the names of eminent historians. The largest rare book collection in North American, the largest and most diverse collections of scientific and technical information in the world, and the most comprehensive collection of American music in the world, are just a fraction of the unique documents housed in the Library. I addition, the Library receives 22,000 items each day. How could Thomas Jefferson ever imagine that his personal library of 6,487 books would one day grow to be such a tremendous source of knowledge. The Library of Congress: an institution that has touched the world, and an institution that has touched history. Congratulations on your bicentennial, and may you continue to make America proud.","word.count":921,"sep11":-2.55337078651685,"years":1999.30617977528,"days":1533,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.105670990674597,"Topic 2":0.26268307932671,"Topic 3":0.0056307160280538,"Topic 4":0.0094338761651526,"Topic 5":0.572549704128688,"Topic 6":0.00663868371600702,"Topic 7":0.00316012520395751,"Topic 8":0.0164300524919495,"Topic 9":0.00274648275093738,"Topic 10":0.0150562895139478},{"id":"10720010009110","body":"Bob Schaffer: Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4737 is a top priority for President Bush and one of the most important bills we'll consider this year. The 1996 welfare reform law--one the most successful social policy initiatives in recent memory--is set to expire later this year. In February, President Bush unveiled his principles for reauthorizing this important law; H.R. 4737, the Personal Responsibility, Work and Family Promotion Act, is based on those principles. Its goal is simple: to put even more Americans on the path to self- sufficiency and independence. While the '96 law has been an unqualified success, there is more work to be done. A majority of TANF recipients-- 58 percent--still aren't working for their benefits. That's why H.R. 4737 strengthens current work requirements. It asks welfare recipients to engage in work-related activities for 40 hours a week--16 of which could be in education, job training, or other constructive activities as defined by states. The measure also gradually increases the work participation rate required of states--by 2007, 70 percent of a state's TANF recipients must be in work-related activities, up from 50 percent in current law. Moreover, the bill makes significant improvements to the Child Care and Development Block Grant. It adds $1 billion in discretionary funding to the program over five years and requires states to devote more money to improving child care quality. The bill also incorporates key elements of President Bush's Good Start, Grow Smart early childhood education plan, encouraging states to make sure children are developmentally prepared to enter school. H.R. 4737 also significantly enhances flexibility for states and localities to integrate a variety of federal programs, including TANF, food stamps, housing assistance, the child care block grant, and workforce investment programs. This innovative plan will give states and localities the opportunity to respond creatively to recipients' needs and improve the efficiency of federal welfare and workforce programs. As a recent Wall Street Journal editorial noted, the State Flex proposal ``has the potential to spur the next wave of reform.'' With this bill, we have the chance to build on the success of the last five years. I look forward to working with my colleagues on this important issue as we move forward. This proposal has been approved by three different House Committees; many Members have had the opportunity to consider and amend this bill. The rule today before us is a fair rule, and I urge members to support it.

I oppose this amendment because there is a great balance in this bill which was very difficult to put together. It represents all of our farming interests from different geographic areas of this Nation. With this amendment, our farmers in the South--particularly Louisiana farmers who have cotton, and soybeans, but particularly our cotton farmers--would be hard hit by this amendment because cotton is an expensive crop to grow. These price caps will be very detrimental to family farmers in Louisiana. In addition, this amendment, while it attempts to put on price caps, would not necessarily help farmers in other parts of the country. It would simply hurt the farmers in the South and in Louisiana. Cotton and rice are very expensive crops to grow. We need to have these crops covered when the price turns down. Finally, while price supports drift over to the larger farmers, it is also the larger farmers who produce most of the crops under the program.

All my Democratic colleagues in the Senate understand the need to take action to steady our economy, and we are prepared to act swiftly and responsibly to pass legislation that puts interest in the security of the American people first. We know, for example, that last year 2\\1/2\\ million Americans secured mortgages, and nearly half of all college students secured loans so they could go to school. The consequences of a broken banking system, devoid of loans for homes, college tuition, automobiles, and business investment would be devastating. We are prepared to do what is necessary to avoid these unacceptable consequences, but we will not let haste abandon good judgment in the process. The Bush administration has called on Congress to rubberstamp its bill without serious debate or efforts to improve it. We can't let that happen. The legislation sent to the Congress by the Treasury Department recognizes the scope of the crisis the Bush administration created, a view that we share with Secretary Paulson. The Bush administration's bill is a starting point but by no means the final product. Democrats believe there should be protection for the taxpayers who are footing the bill for this legislation. That begins with more oversight, more transparency, more accountability, and more controls to prevent conflicts of interest. Democrats believe there should be limits on compensation for company executives who benefit from this legislation so the American people don't see their tax dollars spent on exorbitant corporate pay and even golden parachutes. The American people earn their pay through honest hard work and so should CEOs. What is a golden parachute? It is a method of compensating executives when they leave their companies. It would be wrong for these employees--these managers who are leaving their companies--to get huge amounts of money for simply leaving. This legislation should prevent that. We believe that in exchange for shouldering the enormous burden of the Bush plan, taxpayers should reap any future economic rewards. That is what happened when we bailed out the savings and loans. It should happen here. That means this plan should not permit taxpayer money to purchase an asset at an inflated price exclusively for the benefit of private shareholders. Democrats believe this legislation affects not just the American economy but the global economy, and we will call upon other nations to do their part. But one of the provisions suggested in this bill is that we would spend money to bail out foreign banks. I think we have to be very careful with that. We believe this legislation should provide aid for Americans at risk of losing their homes to foreclosure. As the law currently stands, the wealthiest Americans can seek mortgage assistance from a bankruptcy judge to help keep their second, their third, their fourth, their fifth, their sixth, even their seventh home, but working families can't seek mortgage relief from a bankruptcy judge for their first and only home--their primary residence. That makes no sense, and we should change it. Bankruptcy court should have the authority to reach mutually beneficial arrangements to allow families to keep their homes and prevent more foreclosures. We believe it is not enough to fund a Wall Street bailout. We need an economic recovery plan to create jobs, provide better unemployment insurance, and invest in our country's infrastructure. Now, such a plan has to be voted upon before we adjourn, either as part of this legislation or separately. These steps will help catalyze long-term economic growth once the dust on Wall Street settles. Democrats in Congress fully understand the severity of the situation and the need to pass legislation, but we are not willing to give President Bush a blank check. We are now seeing 8 years of reckless Bush economic policies come crashing down with unimaginable speed and severity. This crisis puts our economy and the well-being of the American people in serious jeopardy. President Bush said on Friday we should assign blame later. What else is he going to say? Of course, he would say exactly that because he is the culprit of the crisis. What else would the culprit say? The American people have a right to know what brought us to this grave economic danger. The answer is the President and a Republican Congress determined to repeal all reasonable oversight and accountability and ignore what they couldn't repeal and allow corporate greed and recklessness to saturate our economy. Democratic and Republican Presidents who served before President Bush all understood that demanding accountability from the financial sector is not somehow anticapitalist but the opposite: It maintains balance, protects taxpayers, and keeps our economy running smoothly. The greed-fueled Bush-Cheney economy thought they knew better. They put cronies and idealogues in charge of our most critical regulatory agencies, people who disdain Government oversight of any kind and systematically put Wall Street ahead of Main Street. One example of this irresponsibility: The Bush administration refused to provide oversight of the mortgage industry to ensure the rules were followed. The result was massive fraud, predatory lending, and a practice of preying on American families with deceptive, dishonest loans. Now, we all know the banking industry has been deregulated, and the few regulations left were not in force. But now we find an article written by Senator McCain in one of the health journals saying he thinks the health care industry should be deregulated just like the bank industry. How about that. It is in writing. President ``Wannabe'' McCain has written an article saying we should treat the health industry just like the banking industry. Now, that is enough said about how Senator McCain is going the take care of the problems of this country economically. This hands-off, business-first, Bush-Cheney economic philosophy infiltrated nearly all aspects of the economy--from mortgages to consumer safety to the airline industry--and the people of America are now left to suffer the consequences. This morning, Monday, the first day of autumn, President Bush released a statement preemptively criticizing Democrats for working to improve his plan. If the President is serious about reaching an effective, bipartisan solution to the economic crisis he and his people created, he should join us in solving the crisis he created. We Democrats in the Senate are not going to drag our feet. We will respond with the urgency of action this situation demands. But after 8 years of a fiscal dereliction of duty, it is time for accountability. It has taken 8 years of this dereliction of duty. Should we resolve the issue in 1 day? I think not. Democrats understand the two primary responsibilities of Government are to protect the physical and fiscal well-being of the people. Whatever the ultimate cost of this legislation, we always remember these funds don't come from some nameless Government account. Every dollar comes directly out of the pocket of every American taxpayer; every dollar that should have been saved for someone's secure retirement, every dollar that could have been invested in health care for the uninsured or education for students or to fund a small business startup. We Democrats understand the value of each and every dollar spent on this plan because we know each and every dollar comes from the American people. We will work unending hours in a bipartisan manner to ensure this legislation doesn't just get done but that we get it done right. s","word.count":1246,"sep11":7.21348314606742,"years":2009.07303370787,"days":5010,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.387236702627745,"Topic 2":0.372794573709512,"Topic 3":0.00607760972639384,"Topic 4":0.00600611686944829,"Topic 5":0.0183623639203194,"Topic 6":0.0848160878219053,"Topic 7":0.0839382880525648,"Topic 8":0.00500842157953726,"Topic 9":0.0341214183060628,"Topic 10":0.00163841738651069},{"id":"10419960009896","body":"John Joseph Moakley: Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out today's rule is one more closed rule in a year of 100 percent restrictive rules. I just want to remind Members of this because of the orations we used to hear from the other side on closed rules. This year, every rule that has come out of the Committee on Rules so far has been restricted in some form. It also waives the three-fifth vote required for tax increases, which my Republican colleagues like so much, they wanted to make it an amendment to the Constitution. If the three-fifth vote for tax increases is that important, Mr. Speaker, why are Republicans waiving it on this bill? In fact, this is the second time the three-fifths vote has come up and it is the second time that they have waived it. Mr. Speaker, today we have a great opportunity. We have the chance to make a huge difference in the lives of millions of Americans. We have the chance to pass a bipartisan health bill that will do two things that will affect every single American. Today, if Republicans will join with the Democrats, we could pass a bill that would enable more people to take their health care with them when they leave a job, and limit preexisting conditions so that people are not denied health care just because they have been previously ill. But, Mr. Speaker, even though this opportunity is right at our fingertips in the form of the Kennedy-Kassebaum-Roukema bill, it is about to slip away. It is because my Republican colleagues have loaded up a very excellent bill with a lot of goodies for special interests. My Republican colleagues, Mr. Speaker, have also added medical savings accounts which will take over $2 billion from Medicare and spend it on tax breaks for younger and wealthier people, and they have added controversial malpractice provisions which will virtually ensure the bill's veto. Mr. Speaker, over the last year I have had a lot of hands-on experience with the American health care system, and I know how important good health care is, and I know how important good health insurance is. I can tell my colleagues there is not a single person in this country that does not worry that they may lose their health care if they change jobs, or even worse, they would be denied their health care coverage just because they have had a previous illness. But this Republican-controlled House is once again about to put the good of special interests before the good of the Nation. Mr. Speaker, this is a time of great uncertainty in our country. Today many workers wake up each morning wondering whether they will have a job at the end of the day and even whether they will be able to provide their family health care. Today health care costs are skyrocketing, and the Republican House is turning a blind eye to the needs of working men and women. But we have heard over and over again our Republican colleagues talk about providing opportunity for America's middle class. Mr. Speaker, if ever there was a chance to do that, this is the bill. This is our chance to do something for the people of this country, and we should take it. I urge my colleagues to defeat the rule, defeat the previous question. It is time to put the American people and their health care before politics. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.","word.count":595,"sep11":-5.59831460674157,"years":1996.26123595506,"days":449,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.599860023726309,"Topic 2":0.22278382557078,"Topic 3":0.0100060689452618,"Topic 4":0.0191773581205453,"Topic 5":0.0419318102724585,"Topic 6":0.0193928541650486,"Topic 7":0.0072730321203375,"Topic 8":0.0574709713975893,"Topic 9":0.00898699676002059,"Topic 10":0.0131170589216492},{"id":"10419950107717","body":"Howell Heflin: Mr. President, as most of my colleagues know, Gen. Carl E. Mundy, Jr., Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps since 1991, will soon be retiring. I have had the personal pleasure of knowing General Mundy as a close friend and fellow Marine for several years. He has enjoyed an outstanding career and has compiled an impeccable record with the Marine Corps. I like to think of General Mundy as a native son of Alabama. He was born in Atlanta, but moved to the State Capital of Montgomery as a young boy. He graduated from Sidney Lanier High School and went on to attend Auburn University. Following his graduation from Auburn, he received his commission as a second lieutenant and began his illustrious military career. As I have said on previous occasions, I know my Senate colleagues from Georgia disagree with me over the issue of General Mundy's state of allegiance. I suppose we can correctly say that he was born in Georgia but that Alabama is proud to consider him an adopted son. General Mundy is a highly decorated officer and a graduate of the Marine Corps Command and Staff College and the Naval War College. He is a recipient of the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, two Navy commendation medals, and the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry. Carl Mundy rose through the ranks from his early service in the Second Marine Division, aboard the aircraft carrier Tarawa and the cruiser Little Rock, to become a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as the Marine Corp's top soldier. In between, he served numerous tours of duty in Vietnam, including stints as operations officer and executive officer of the Third Battalion, 26th Marines, and Third Marine Division. He was also an intelligence officer with the Third Marine Amphibious Force Headquarters. Prior to being named as a brigadier general in 1982, General Mundy served as aide de camp to the Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps; as commanding officer, Second Battalion, Fourth Marines, Third Marine Division; as chief of staff, Sixth Marine Amphibious Brigade; and as commanding officer, Second Marines, Second Marine Division and 36th and 38th Marine Amphibious Units. He quickly climbed the Marines' career ladder, advancing to major general in April 1986 and lieutenant general in March 1988. He was the commanding general of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet Marine Force when he became commandant 4 years ago after the retirement of his also-renowned predecessor, Gen. Al Gray. Among the most endearing qualities of General Mundy--one of which most of his colleagues and subordinates are not fully aware--is that of his family life. I know he has a loving wife Linda, a wonderful daughter, Betsy, and that he has had a great influence on his sons, who have followed in his footsteps. Like their father, both Carl III and Timothy graduated from Auburn University and now serve as Marine Corps officers. They have both adopted his unyielding dedication to the Marines. General Mundy lives and breathes the Marine Corps, both in the field and at home. In living and breathing the Marine Corps for many years, Gen. Carl E. Mundy, Jr., has served his country with great distinction, pride, and honor. He has been an outstanding commandant who has guided the Marines through some difficult times. On behalf of the Senate, we thank him and wish him a long, happy, and healthy retirement. At the same time, we hope that we have not seen the end of his public service. ``Semper Fidelis.'' I have a copy of an article which appeared in the summer 1994 edition of Auburn Magazine entitled ``First Among The Few.'' It gives a detailed account of General Mundy's life and career and captures the essence of this consummate Marine and military leader. I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:","word.count":657,"sep11":-6.36516853932584,"years":1995.49438202247,"days":176,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.778468051758948,"Topic 2":0.0776245944830849,"Topic 3":0.0155353598791945,"Topic 4":0.035940465222113,"Topic 5":0.0164164932107381,"Topic 6":0.0144887884942594,"Topic 7":0.0122950656359237,"Topic 8":0.0256588025931973,"Topic 9":0.0164748311824851,"Topic 10":0.0070975475400556},{"id":"10419960050410","body":"Claiborne Pell: Mr. President, I bring to the attention of my colleagues Burundi, a small Central African country. There are 6 million people who live in Burundi. Each week, a civil insurgency tightens its grip on this poor African nation, causing the deaths of hundreds of people. The killing frenzy in Burundi has barely touched international headlines, as it has been dwarfed by the calamities striking Israel and Bosnia. But consider the situation if it were to occur in the United States. The United States has a population of about 260 million. Sliding the scale to the figures of the United States, we would see 30,000 Americans dying a week; 1,560,000 a year. Burundi, my colleagues, is on the brink of national suicide. The hostilities in Burundi are between the Tutsi-controlled army and Hutu rebels. The current turmoil is the fallout of the explosion of tensions between Tutsi's and Hutu's in 1993. That year, the country's first popularly elected President, a Hutu, was assassinated. In the chaotic aftermath of his death, tens of thousands of Burundians were killed, hundreds of thousands were displaced. Today, Burundi is ruled by a coalition of moderate Hutus and Tutsis who agreed to share power through the mediation of U.N. Secretary General's former special representative, Ambassador Ahmedou Abdallah. The moderates who lead this Government have tried to contain the violence. Their efforts, however, continue to be threatened by extremists on both sides. A breakdown in Burundi could have catastrophic effects in the country, the region, and in the international community. The world witnessed at great length the tragedy that wrecked Rwanda 2 years ago. Rwanda shares the ethnic makeup of Burundi and is just barely coming to grips with the horror it endured. A collapse in Burundi could crack the fragile peace now established in Rwanda and even worse, could trigger a regional genocide. The international community cannot afford to sit back and watch another egregious slaughter. The international community, with leadership from the United States, can help. First, we should support last Saturday's meeting of African leaders in Tunis. This meeting was brokered by former President Jimmy Carter. Second, there must be diplomatic efforts to persuade the extremists on both sides that violence is not a credible option. If violence resumes, the United States, in conjunction with its European allies, should be prepared to impose an arms embargo, block international financial transactions by Burundi's extremists and stop all trade with Burundi with the exception of humanitarian relief. And third, we, the Congress, should stand behind the State Department, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and private American voluntary and relief projects whose programs promote peace and national reconciliation. Burundi represents a great opportunity for the world community to exercise preventative diplomacy. The United States should do its share of constructive engagement and assist in heading off a regional genocide before it is too late.","word.count":478,"sep11":-5.60674157303371,"years":1996.25280898876,"days":446,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0427733679583169,"Topic 2":0.017861352087204,"Topic 3":0.168061265588434,"Topic 4":0.0100416936166721,"Topic 5":0.162843460642165,"Topic 6":0.377630319458389,"Topic 7":0.0406214802325988,"Topic 8":0.174985126273122,"Topic 9":0.0030432053891561,"Topic 10":0.00213872875394346},{"id":"11020080055237","body":"Richard J. Durbin: Mr. President, President Bush is in Iowa today to see first-hand some of the devastation that more than a week of severe flooding has inflicted on that State. It is the President's first visit to the Midwest since the floods began more than a week ago. Midwesterners appreciate the President's visit to our region. These floods are happening in our States, but they are a national disaster. The President's visit to Iowa today gives us some reassurance that the Federal Government will help our region through this crisis. As the President visits Iowa today, I hope he looks across the river to my State of Illinois. Floods don't stop at State lines. The floodwaters are receding now in Iowa; they are rising in Illinois. Levees are breaking and farmland and towns along our side of the Mississippi are being swallowed up by the river now. The damage in Iowa has been staggering and heartbreaking , and we pray for our neighbors' safety and well-being. But the entire Midwest is reeling from weeks of flooding and tornadoes--from Minnesota to Kansas and everywhere in between; Wisconsin, Iowa, Missouri, and, of course, Illinois. We know from the great flood that devastated the Midwest in 1993 and, more recently, from Hurricane Katrina, that the losses from this chain of weather-related disasters will be more than our States and citizens alone can shoulder. We also know that, in times of crisis, Americans have always come together to help those in need. We are counting on that American tradition of cooperation now. My colleagues and I whose States have borne the brunt of these floods appreciate greatly the support and offers of cooperation we have received from Senator Landrieu and others whose States have also suffered major natural disasters. I hope that President Bush and others are equally committed to rebuilding the Midwest, not just through disaster relief but by strengthening levees, rebuilding houses, providing loans to small businesses, or helping farmers who have lost an entire season of crops. As we speak, the floodwaters are still rising--in Iowa in Missouri, and in my State of Illinois--breaking levees, leaving people without running water, and leaving whole towns submerged. Yesterday, two more levees broke on the Illinois-Iowa border near Quincy, flooding thousands of acres of farmland and forcing people to leave their homes. That brings the total number of broken levees in Illinois to nine as a result of the flooding. In Galesburg, residents are on boil order and are in danger of losing their access to running water. In Lawrenceville, where the floodwaters from earlier storms are finally receding, over 10,000 people have been without running water for more than a week. We will not forget our neighbors on the east side of the State, where it all began earlier this month. Over 500 homes have been affected in Machesney Park, a small community in Winnebago County without a public works department and without trucks or any other equipment to help with the clean-up efforts. My heart goes out to everyone affected by the floods, especially those who have watched their homes and livelihoods disappear under muddy waters. But as the waters keep rising, the people of Illinois continue to humble and inspire me. Illinoisans continue to work day and night to prepare for the worst. In cities and towns all along the Mississippi, people have spent the last week filling sandbags and fortifying levees. This is difficult work, often backbreaking, but as hard as it's been on the body, it hasn't broken people's spirits. Day after day they have shown up--residents, volunteers, emergency workers, members of the Illinois National Guard. It is not easy to stand your ground in the face of a force as powerful as the Mississippi, but these folks have done just that. Their resolve and determination show an amazing spirit at work. It is something Senator Obama and I had a chance to see for ourselves when we were in Quincy and Grafton last week. It is a sight to behold. I also commend FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers. They are doing what needs to be done to help these communities prepare for the worst. A number of State of Illinois departments and agencies are working 24/7 to ensure communities have the resources to fight the flood waters. This is truly a team effort. Right now we are in a race against time and nature. The worst is still to come. The river is still swelling and is projected to crest for many of the communities farther south in the coming days. When the floodwaters recede, we will need to roll up our sleeves and begin the long, hard process of rebuilding. Senator Obama and I will be working with the Illinois congressional delegation and our Senate colleagues to ensure that the people in the Midwest will not face this formidable task of rebuilding alone. My thoughts and prayers are with everyone on the ground.","word.count":826,"sep11":6.94662921348315,"years":2008.80617977528,"days":4915,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0798260645855099,"Topic 2":0.0222521047505644,"Topic 3":0.00602545393241319,"Topic 4":0.00617958364463631,"Topic 5":0.00553651965875687,"Topic 6":0.363139153308295,"Topic 7":0.0857548616181683,"Topic 8":0.386606432606276,"Topic 9":0.00641373040215865,"Topic 10":0.0382660954932216},{"id":"10619990091081","body":"Jeff Bingaman: Mr. President, I am very pleased to join Senators Frist and McCain today in introducing the ``Electronic Commerce Technology Promotion Act.'' This bill, which sets up a center of Excellence in Electronic Commerce at the National Institutes of Standards and Technology, or NIST, is a solid step towards adapting an important federal agency to the digital economy we see blooming around us. NIST was established in 1901 as the National Bureau of Standards during a time of tremendous industrial development, when technology became a key driver of our economic growth. Making those technologies literally fit together reliably through standards became crucial, and Congress realized that one key to sustaining our industrial growth and the quality of our products would be a federal laboratory devoted to developing standards. The Bureau of Standards is a classic example of how the federal government can support technical progress that undergirds economic growth and enables the competitive marketplace to work. Around ten years ago, Congress modified the Bureau's charter in response to the problems of the 1980's, increasing its focus on competitiveness, adding efforts like the highly regarded Manufacturing Extension Program , and changing the name to NIST. Turning to the challenges of today's growing digital economy, this bill makes NIST a focal point in the federal government for promoting electronic commerce throughout our economy by establishing a Center of Excellence in Electronic Commerce there. While the challenges of making things fit together in a digital economy are different--and now go under the un- melodic term ``interoperability''--they are just as crucial as they were in the industrial economy of 1901. And, NIST remains an excellent place to lead the work. I'm particularly pleased that this bill includes the fundamental idea behind my bill S. 1494, the Electronic Commerce Extension Establishment Act of 1999. That is, NIST ought to lead an electronic commerce extension program or service to provide small businesses with low cost, impartial technical advice on how to enter and succeed in e-commerce. This service will help ensure that small businesses in every part of the nation fully participate in the unfolding e-commerce revolution through a well-proven policy tool--a service analogous to the Department of Agriculture's Cooperative Extension Service and NIST's own MEP. I believe such a service would help both small businesses and our entire economy as the productivity enhancements from e-commerce are spread more rapidly, and I recently asked Secretary Daley for a report on how such a service should work. So, I thank Senator Frist for including my basic policy idea in his bill and look forward to working with him to flesh it out, particularly in light of the report we should get from the Commerce Department. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join Senators Frist, McCain, and myself in supporting this bill, as one step the Congress can take to make sure an important federal agency, NIST, continues its strong tradition of helping our economy--our growing digital economy--to be the most competitive in the world.

Mr. President, I rise on behalf of myself and my colleague, Senator Kyl, to offer legislation that will make an important clarification to the Ak-Chin Water Rights Settlement Act of 1984. Similar legislation has been introduced in the House by Representative Shadegg. Let me explain why this legislation is necessary. In 1992, Congress amended the Ak-Chin Water Rights Settlement Act to allow the Ak-Chin Indian Community to enter into leases of the Community's water for a term not to exceed 100 years. On December 15, 1994, the Ak-Chin Indian Community entered into an agreement with the Del Webb Corporation to allow the company the option to lease up to 10,000 acre-feet of water for a period of 100 years from the date the option was exercised. Del Webb exercised the option on December 6, 1996, with a principal objective of providing a water supply for its development of a master-planned community in the Phoenix area. However, since 1995, the State of Arizona, through its Department of Water Resources, has required certificates of assured water supply for 100 years for developments within the Phoenix Active Management Area. The 100-year assured water supply requirement is one of the key tenets of Arizona's water resource management. A certificate cannot be obtained unless a developer demonstrates that sufficient groundwater, surface water or adequate quality effluent will be continuously available to satisfy the proposed use of the development for at least 100 years. Unfortunately, the lease as signed in 1996 has now matured for three years without the actual application to the Arizona Department of Water Resources for a certificate of assured water supply. The Arizona Department of Water Resources advised the company that it interprets its regulations to require Del Webb to demonstrate that water leased under the agreement with the Community will be available for a period of 100 years from the date each certificate issued. Under ADWR's interpretation, if Del Webb applies for a certificate of assured water supply on December 6, 1999, it must show that water will be available under the lease agreement until December 6, 2099. However, because Del Webb exercised its option in 1996, the lease agreement between Del Webb and the Community will expire on December 6, 2096, and will not meet the State's test of continuing legal and physical availability of water supply. Moreover, the Community does not have statutory authority to grant leases with terms in excess of 100 years. To resolve this unanticipated conflict, the affected parties have agreed that what is required is a simple modification to the Ak-Chin Water Rights Settlement Act of 1984 to allow the extension of leasing authority to include options to lease and renew or extend existing leases. This change will allow the Ak-Chin Indian Community to extend or renew the existing lease to Del Webb for a cumulative term that would expire more than 100 years from today. Mr. President, this legislation will make a technical change to the Ak-Chin Water Rights Settlement Act in order for the Ak-Chin/Del Webb agreement to be in compliance with State law. All parties and interests directly impacted by this lease agreement are supportive of this amendment. Therefore, it is our hope that we can move this legislation quickly. I ask to include a complete text of the legislation in the Record. The bill follows: S. 1914. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide for the creation of disaster protection funds by property and casualty insurance companies for the payment of policyholders' claims arising from future catastrophic events; to the Committee on Finance. &lt;bullet&gt; Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to address a problem that ought to be a concern to all of us: natural disasters and the exposure of the private insurance industry to catastrophic risks. In my state of Florida, we have a particular concern about hurricane risk, but many areas of the country are exposed to the risks of other major catastrophes--whether they be volcanoes, earthquakes or tornadoes. Increasingly, I am concerned about the state of the private insurance industry and its ability to withstand a major catastrophe--a catastrophe of Hurricane Andrew size or greater. Today, I am introducing legislation to help address this problem and strengthen disaster protection for homeowners and businesses while protecting the interests of the taxpayer. I am pleased my friend from Texas, Senator Hutchison, has joined me in this effort. I believe our approach is an innovative, private-sector solution to the problem of catastrophic risk and I encourage my colleagues to review this proposal carefully. Consumers of property and casualty insurance must be able to rely on their insurers for protection against the risk of catastrophic loss. However, protection for policyholders in today's system is weak; a major future catastrophe could leave consumers without protection and-- if past experience is any indication--the government would intervene to ensure the people in the disaster areas receive timely compensation. It is important to note that current law actually poses a disincentive for insurers to set aside special reserves for catastrophic events. Any money set aside to cover potential risk is considered taxable income. To fix this flaw in America's insurance system, we need to provide incentives for insurers to set aside a portion of their policy premiums in secure reserve funds that will be available to meet policyholder needs in the event of future catastrophes. Our bill does just that. The typical property and casualty insurance company in the United States is exposed to multiple forms of catastrophic risk. This risk can take the form of major disasters that occur only once in a decade or once in several decades . These can also be in the form of localized natural disasters that cause unusually large policyholder losses in a region and imperil the ability of smaller insurance companies to help their policyholders in the area. The nation's exposure to these large natural disasters is staggering. While millions of families and small businesses rely on insurance payments to recover from natural disasters, it is important to remember that--under our current insurance tax and regulatory systems--many private insurers may not be able to pay all claims arising from a major disaster. Hurricane Andrew and the Northridge Earthquake opened our eyes to the country's massive exposure to catastrophic losses.

This memorandum, which is now part of the Record, says that they estimate that ``2.4 million of the returns [who have children in private school] would utilize education IRAs'' and that those returns would utilize ``52 percent of the tax benefit. . .'' On the other hand, this letter says that the ``35.4 million returns [with] dependents in public schools'' would utilize 48 percent of the tax benefit. That is a direct quote from the Joint Committee on Taxation. Relative to the amendment of the Senator from Missouri, I will just speak briefly because I will turn the remainder of the time over to the Senator from Massachusetts on this issue. But I will say this. I do not disagree with his point that local school districts, communities, and parents should control the curriculum. I happen to be a strong believer in local control. Whether or not a school district wants to use new math or old math is something they ought to be able to decide. But one of the things they also should be able to decide is whether or not they want to utilize a national test which will give them some idea as to where their students stand relative to other students. If they do not like that idea, they should not have to give that test. That should be a local option. It is a local option under the President's proposal. It is not a mandatory test. It is voluntary as he proposes it. School districts can use it or not use it. The question is whether or not, then, we should deny a school district the option, whether we should deny a local community an option to use a tool if they see fit to use it. That is the issue. That tool may not be a useful tool. The Senator from Missouri may be correct. A school district may decide they do not want any part of it for the reasons that he gives. That should be the right and is the right of the local school district under the President's proposal. But it should also be an obligation available to a local school district if they think there is a benefit from utilizing a national test. Why deny a community? Why deny a local government, a local school district, a tool which they believe is useful? That is the issue. That is what would be denied under this second- degree amendment. I don't think we ought to deny that opportunity here for local school districts to make that choice. Mr. President, I ask unanimous I be allowed to yield the remainder of my time to be under the control of the Senator from Massachusetts.","word.count":485,"sep11":-3.47752808988764,"years":1998.38202247191,"days":1204,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.37733199197742,"Topic 2":0.265976666367187,"Topic 3":0.00698221949280228,"Topic 4":0.01642844727157,"Topic 5":0.00878900031921754,"Topic 6":0.00782112745089304,"Topic 7":0.0112300539355093,"Topic 8":0.0120482016766207,"Topic 9":0.287897829332404,"Topic 10":0.0054944621763756},{"id":"10720010013574","body":"Marcy Kaptur: Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. I rise in opposition to the amendment. Mr. Chairman, when I listened to the sponsor of the amendment talk about benefits, tremendous benefits, significant benefits, benefit benefits, I did not count them all. The only real benefit here is safety. These people in places like Kalispell, Montana, made the determination that they wanted to do something about the organized mayhem that was created by the Forest Service and their forest fire adding, doubling, the number of airplanes, tankers, helicopters, in the air per day for months on end. I do not know how many pilots are on the floor today, but I can tell the Members that pilots sometimes need help. They certainly need help when the number of traffic count in one day doubles because of a forest fire. Now, couple that with smoke and mountains and activity, and when I talk about organized mayhem, sometimes the people in the tower are the only safety valve for those people. So what is the benefit here? The benefit is to save lives. Is that not what this Congress is all about? Is this, the bill of the gentleman from Mississippi that we are talking about, creating the safety? No. The safety is created by the individuals in the communities that make a determination that they have a need. Now, the logic is lost on me that somehow the airports that did not build their towers did not need it or are somehow at a loss for this. No, they made the determination that for safety reasons they did not need to have a tower, but our airport did make that determination. So rather than punish our communities for doing that, we ought to reward them. The $30 million figure, again, I will give an example of why that is not true. I am the only Congressman in this body who has two of those airports in their district, Bozeman, Montana, and Kalispell, Montana. Kalispell, Montana, will ask for a reimbursement from their account. It is their money into the future. They have made that a top priority. Bozeman, Montana, will not. They have announced that they have made the prioritization, and they have the ability under their taxpayer funding in their local community to withstand that cost, and they will do that. They will not ask for a reimbursement. So it is not $30 million, it must be something less, because Bozeman, Montana, is not coming in for the money. So I thank the gentleman from Florida for specifically pointing out the difference between ``may'' and ``shall,'' because in our particular case, it is ``may.'' So I ask the Members, my friends in the legislative body, to please oppose this amendment. It does not make sense. It is one-size-fits-all, and that is the wrongheadedness that so often occurs in the United States Congress. We need the flexibility. We need to understand it is not about money, it is about safety and saving lives. Let us reward the airports for having done the right thing. I hope Members will kill this amendment and support the Wicker bill.","word.count":1182,"sep11":-0.210674157303371,"years":2001.64887640449,"days":2367,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0451679239691782,"Topic 2":0.210446019131841,"Topic 3":0.00665335779675752,"Topic 4":0.00690952147001149,"Topic 5":0.399193472603565,"Topic 6":0.00432397437446925,"Topic 7":0.00288913557032615,"Topic 8":0.300340316175319,"Topic 9":0.0143453614798475,"Topic 10":0.00973091742868454},{"id":"10720020059536","body":"George Voinovich: Mr. President, I say to the Senator, I beg to differ with the Senator from Nevada.

Clay Shaw: Mr. President, let me describe the amendment briefly. It is intended to prevent foreign students coming to the United States to obtain a free taxpayer-financed education at a public elementary or secondary school. This is a growing problem. Children are coming to the United States and staying with friends or relatives or even strangers to whom they pay a fee and attending public schools as residents of the school district. The amendment prohibits counselor offices issuing visas for attendance at such public schools or the INS approving such cases unless the foreign student can demonstrate they will reimburse the school, public elementary or secondary school, ``for the full, unsubsidized per capita cost'' of providing such education, or unless the school waives reimbursement. The amendment also provides for the exclusion and deportation of students who are admitted to attend private elementary or secondary schools but who do not remain enrolled at such private schools for the duration of their elementary or secondary study in the United States. This provision is designed to prevent students from obtaining admission to a private school and then switching to a taxpayer-funded public school soon after arrival in the United States. It would not prevent those children who are validly in the United States as dependents of persons lawfully residing here from applying for admission to public schools, nor would it prevent public schools from hosting foreign exchange students who would continue to be admitted as exchange visitors on ``J'' visas. The amendment is designed, however, to deal with the problem of the ``parachute kids'' which Senator Feinstein dealt with previously--which has received rather thorough attention-- those who come here to receive a U.S. education at taxpayer expense.","word.count":162,"sep11":-6.1123595505618,"years":1995.74719101124,"days":266,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.254495715261533,"Topic 2":0.0739562891256037,"Topic 3":0.0185776067992001,"Topic 4":0.251485393787545,"Topic 5":0.0193003837136876,"Topic 6":0.0304908855585328,"Topic 7":0.00727389378855055,"Topic 8":0.301410583288888,"Topic 9":0.011009158443707,"Topic 10":0.0320000902327517},{"id":"10519980086016","body":"John Chafee: Mr. President, like my friend from Arkansas, I am concerned about the effect that mail order sales companies have on local retailers. I have no axe to grind with these businesses, and in fact applaud their ability to provide a very important service to many Americans. The convenience of this type of purchasing is good for the consumer. What does concern me is the possibility that mail order and other direct sales companies' popularity is on the rise simply because they are not required to collect state sales taxes. I do not know if that is the true reason for their growth, but I would be concerned if they are taking advantage of what may be, in effect, an uneven playing field. Remember, local merchants, who compete with direct sales companies for business, have no opportunity to avoid collecting sales tax on their transactions. Mr. President, the amendment offered by the Senator from Arkansas raises a very important issue, and I am glad that the Senate has had the opportunity to debate it this morning. But this is a complicated issue, and cannot be fully considered over a few hours of debate on the floor of the Senate. I have several questions about the proposal offered by the Senator from Arkansas. For example, is it reasonable to set the exemption level at $3 million of annual sales? Is the per state exemption level of $100,000 in annual sales an appropriate level? On whom should this obligation be imposed? Mr. President, these are just some of the questions that the Advisory Commission should be given the opportunity to explore. It may be that when this issue is fully reviewed, the Congress will decide that the approach proposed by the Senator from Arkansas is the correct one.

I also thank her for her excellent and her tireless work on this bill. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the conference report. This legislation is a remarkable improvement over the House bill and deserves the support of us today. The bill represents a good compromise reflecting the views of schools, disability advocates and, most importantly, parents. The bill protects the civil rights of children with disabilities in critical areas. The bill ensures compliance with IDEA's key provisions through a strong monitoring and enforcement system. This system will lead States to fix problems before children with disabilities fail to receive a free appropriate public education. This bill also makes IDEA work for all stakeholders: students, parents, teachers, school administrators, and school districts. First, the legislation provides new opportunities for parents and schools to address concerns before the need to file a lawsuit arises. Second, the bill increases parental involvement in IEP meetings by allowing the use of teleconferencing, video conferencing, and other alternative means of participation. Third, the legislation requires initial evaluations to occur within 60 days of referral, ensuring that children get the help they need. The conference report also provides fiscal relief for school districts. The bill allows school districts which are in compliance with IDEA to replace a portion of their local expenditures with Federal funding. This will allow school districts to begin to realize the promise we made 30 years ago to provide the Federal share of special education costs. Most importantly, Mr. Speaker, the bill also improves discipline and ensures the safety of disabled and nondisabled children alike. The bill requires schools to determine if a child's behavior was the result of their disability or poor implementation of their IEP when considering a disciplinary action. In addition, the bill prevents schools from placing children with disabilities in alternative placements for unlimited periods of time. Despite its positive aspects, Mr. Speaker, the main failure of this legislation is that it does not immediately meet the promise of full funding of IDEA. We made this promise nearly 30 years ago and have consistently failed to meet it. Soon we will have an appropriations bill on this floor, hopefully today, that will not even meet the levels we have authorized in this bill. While I support this conference report, we need to do a better job of living up to our promises.

But those who have suffered a catastrophic loss have no crop with which to make these repayments.","word.count":158,"sep11":-6.13202247191011,"years":1995.72752808989,"days":259,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.818741895760369,"Topic 2":0.0593004619401797,"Topic 3":0.0130291587066939,"Topic 4":0.0296020103204561,"Topic 5":0.0130802384902662,"Topic 6":0.013073550364895,"Topic 7":0.0102996799850621,"Topic 8":0.0230674766563861,"Topic 9":0.0139080376105716,"Topic 10":0.00589749016512052},{"id":"11020070015237","body":"Mike McIntyre: Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Bebe Moore Campbell will be remembered as a celebrated writer and journalist whose New York Times best selling novel, ``72 Hour Hold,'' challenged minority communities to be open with their mental health and lower the stigma associated with receiving therapy. Her ability to assess the mental health delivery system from a minority vantage point has helped raise awareness and remove barriers. Mental illness, Mr. Speaker, can be crippling, not only to the individuals suffering from this disease, but obviously also the family and friends of that person. In some cases, therapy is declined or refused because mental health care is seen as the treatment of last resort. But we must improve public awareness and erase the stigma that is so often associated with mental illness. Again, I would like to thank my friend and colleague, the author of the resolution, Mr. Wynn of Maryland, for raising public awareness of mental illness in minority communities and the importance of getting proper mental health treatment to those and for those who have been diagnosed.

I commend Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi for their extraordinary effort in putting this measure together on a broad bipartisan basis. As I indicated, it has been cleared on both sides of the aisle. It is time to pass this measure and hope that the House will act in short order. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 439, S. 2803. The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report the bill by title. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill, which had been reported from the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, with an amendment to strike all after the enacting clause and insert in lieu thereof the following: &lt;bullet&gt; Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006. This legislation, The MINER Act, represents the most comprehensive overhaul of our Nation's mine safety laws in a generation. S. 2803, was unanimously reported out last week by the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. It is the product of a truly bipartisan effort undertaken with the single goal of improving the safety of our Nation's miners. I would like to thank Senator Kennedy, the ranking member of the HELP Committee, Senators Isakson and Murray, the chair and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety; and Senators Byrd and Rockefeller of West Virginia for their long and tireless efforts in fashioning this legislation. I would also like to express my thanks to Senators DeWine, Santorum, Specter, McConnell, and Bunning for their cosponsorship of this legislation. This year we have witnessed a series of tragic losses in the coal mining community. The year began with the deadly accidents at the Sago and Alma mines in West Virginia. It continued this weekend with the deaths of five miners in a coal mine explosion in eastern Kentucky. Nothing we can do here can bring back those whose lives have been lost. We can, however, best honor those who have lost their lives by making such accidents less likely in the future, and making it more likely that miners will survive such accidents when they do occur. That is the aim of the MINER Act. The MINER Act would require that coal mines develop and continuously update emergency response and preparedness plans that are designed to make mining accidents more survivable. These plans will incorporate technological advances designed to enhance surface to underground communication, to aid in the location of underground personnel, and to provide additional breathable air for miners that are trapped underground. The legislation codifies the requirements for mine rescue teams, affords protections for these heroic volunteers, and ensures that they, and other necessary Federal resources, will be promptly called upon when an emergency occurs. The bill further recognizes that the development of mine safety technology, and the education and training of all those who work in the industry are vital elements in the effort to improve mine safety. Thus, the legislation enhances the mine safety research and development efforts of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health. It encourages private sector technology development, and speeds the approval of new equipment. It also provides a mechanism for sharing technical research and development among Federal agencies. The bill will also provide grants for additional safety training, and scholarship funds for mine safety related education. In addition, the legislation recognizes the fact that despite the tragedies of this year, the safety record in the mining industry has been a good one that continues to improve. This has been due to the concerted efforts of State and Federal regulators, mine employees, and mine operators, the vast majority of whom are serious and steadfast in meeting their workplace safety responsibilities. However, there are a few operators that fall outside the mold; thus, the legislation contains enhanced penalty provisions targeted at these few ``bad actors.'' Those who work in our Nation's mines play a vital role in our country's economic well-being and energy security. They deserve our best efforts to provide for their protection as they perform their often dangerous work. I believe that the MINER Act does make major safety improvements that will better protect miners both today and in years to come.&lt;bullet&gt;","word.count":751,"sep11":4.82022471910112,"years":2006.6797752809,"days":4158,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0144966310461089,"Topic 2":0.0324265486614248,"Topic 3":0.320447227694076,"Topic 4":0.00422037313359089,"Topic 5":0.0238250872189065,"Topic 6":0.165515531337089,"Topic 7":0.00487706137446349,"Topic 8":0.351606033206842,"Topic 9":0.0315700379553883,"Topic 10":0.0510154683721099},{"id":"10720010037703","body":"Trent Lott: Under the previous order, there are now 2 minutes evenly divided for debate on amendment No. 3108.

Commander Cheryl Washington. Simply stated, this case is a tragedy. It is a tragedy in all aspects. The first tragedy was the heinous assault, a gang rape, that occurred at Miramar Naval Air Station in San Diego. Lives have been altered, changed and ruined. And only through tremendous faith and human will can this incident, this crime, ever be reckoned with and overcome. The next tragedy was the treatment of a Navy Chaplain who only wanted to tell the truth. Someone who only tried to do what was right and just. Someone who saw wrong and tried to right it, who tried to make sure that justice prevailed. Yet, he also became a victim. The next tragedy, the one that is most disappointing, the one I hope that can be rectified, is the tragedy of the response of the United States Navy. The brave men and women of our Nation join the military services for many different reasons. Some join because they want an education, and they see the military as a way to break the bonds of poverty and to better themselves. Some join because they seek an adventure, an adventure that is not available to them in the small town where they live, or the crime-ridden streets of their city, or the mundaneness of their neighborhoods. Some join to ``be all that they can be.'' They want to prove to themselves that they are able to meet the physical, mental, and emotional challenges. Others join because they want to belong to a group, a group that has a purpose. There are as many reasons to join our Nation's military as there are people who have signed up. Mr. Speaker, there is one underlying reason that is shared by all the enlisted personnel and officers who currently serve, who have ever served, and who sit today at a school desk and dream of serving. They all love this country, and they all want to see that America stays strong, independent and free. They all believe that they can make a difference in this country and that their best opportunity for making that difference is through serving our country by helping to defend it against aggression. That is why this case is so sad and heartbreaking. Chaplain Willie Williams, Lieutenant Commander Cheryl Washington, and scores of others have been let down, have been treated unfairly and unjustly, have been abused, and have been betrayed. They have been betrayed by the people who they served with, the people they trusted to do what was right, the people they willingly allowed to lead them, whom they willingly would follow into battle. If this continues much further, Mr. Speaker, they will have been betrayed by the institution that they loved, the United States Navy. I was first contacted by Chaplain Willie Williams in January of this year. He had some very serious allegations to make. He claimed that a young woman had been sexually assaulted numerous times and that, when he reported this, he himself became the subject of investigation, and that the subsequent investigation was conducted with a complete lack of integrity, thoroughness, and efficiency. I found this allegation, Mr. Speaker, very troubling. I represent a ``Navy town.'' Many of you in this body have made official trips to San Diego to review our naval facilities there. There is no better Naval port in the world and no place where the quality of life for the men and women serve in the Navy is better. Thousands of Navy personnel retire to San Diego. In short, the Navy has been good to San Diego, and San Diego has been good to the Navy. Whenever I am approached by anyone who tells of a Navy injustice, I tend to be skeptical. I want to believe the Navy, Mr. Speaker; but, with this case, there is something that was just not right. There was something that did not ring true. I hope that this case is not over. Chaplain Williams has been court martialed. But he tried to do the right thing. He tried to stand up for fair play, he tried to stand up for justice, and he tried to stand up for the truth. I hope the Navy has not ignored these and chosen to follow a path that is littered with racial discrimination, yes, Mr. Speaker, cover-up and vindictiveness. Mr. Speaker, I call today on Navy Secretary Dalton, as did the gentleman from Illinois , to personally review this case and be sure that no stone is left unturned, that every step is taken to ensure that it is a road to justice that is traveled by our very own United States Navy.","word.count":813,"sep11":-3.40449438202247,"years":1998.45505617978,"days":1230,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0646769591534372,"Topic 2":0.230340808419374,"Topic 3":0.0447327955469777,"Topic 4":0.0489283584965392,"Topic 5":0.034284149196835,"Topic 6":0.0322275178217312,"Topic 7":0.026754641514396,"Topic 8":0.115378596303499,"Topic 9":0.393437207649854,"Topic 10":0.00923896589735618},{"id":"10519970015576","body":"Jack Kingston: Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays The yeas and nays were ordered.","word.count":203,"sep11":-4.35955056179775,"years":1997.5,"days":890,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.879413822245842,"Topic 2":0.0412688765042984,"Topic 3":0.00849599947429249,"Topic 4":0.0189084896011087,"Topic 5":0.0085403764056053,"Topic 6":0.00942488321103518,"Topic 7":0.0065315334440519,"Topic 8":0.0147875303627786,"Topic 9":0.00899989022403186,"Topic 10":0.0036285985269555},{"id":"10820040026049","body":"Barbara Lee: Mr. Speaker, I rise today because, as we speak, genocide is occurring in Darfur in the western Sudan.

Also, let me just recognize and thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his efforts as our ranking member of the Subcommittee on Africa for always keeping African issues at the front of our congressional legislative agenda. For so many years he has been sounding the alarm, and finally tonight we are here. So I just want to thank him for his constant sounding of the alarm for this and for the people of the Sudan. The murders, the rape, and the scorched-earth campaign in Darfur is genocide. We call it what it is by supporting this resolution. As a member of the Subcommittee on Africa, there has been no evidence presented to indicate that this is not genocide. It is. It has been 10 years, Mr. Speaker, and the international community, particularly the United States, must learn from the Rwandan tragedy. Like Rwanda, the warning signs in Darfur were obvious. But we did nothing, and now the international community is watching once again as millions of Black Africans are wiped out of western Sudan. The Bush administration has raised concerns and the United Nations has denounced the ``ethnic cleansing'' executed by militias supported by the Khartoum government, but this is beyond ethnic cleansing. This is systematic and calculated genocide. Hundreds of thousands are fleeing Darfur, fearing that they will become yet another statistic in a malicious plan to rape, torture, and ultimately wipe out all Blacks in the southwest region of Sudan. As in other conflicts designed deliberately to humiliate and eliminate people because of their identity, we have seen women and girls targeted for rape in Darfur. How can we allow this travesty to continue and not be outraged? The inaction of this administration I think is unconscionable, especially when we consider that one word, one word, ``genocide,'' can make the difference between humanitarian assistance and international justice for Darfurians. Let us pass this resolution. Why would the Bush Administration argue over the definition of genocide, while murderers, rapists, the janjaweed, and the Khartoum government have the blood of the Darfur people on their hands? The government of Sudan is not our partner in peace. Our sense of morality requires us to do everything possible to stop this carnage.

Board of Education, education on equal terms still eludes too many African- American schoolchildren. Secretary of Education Rod Paige has called America's persistent racial achievement gap ``the civil rights issue of our time.'' By the 12th grade, only one in six Black students and one in five Hispanic students are reading at their grade level. Math scores are equally as disturbing. Only 3 percent of Blacks and 4 percent of Hispanics test at proficient levels by their senior year. By another standard, about 60 percent of African-American children read at or below basic level at the end of the fourth grade while 75 percent of White students read at basic or above at the end of the fourth grade. There is still a huge achievement gap among African-American children and White children. The No Child Left Behind Act's system of standards and accountability is creating a foundation for closing the gap. But funding disparities between rich and poor--too often minority children attend poorer schools--school districts remain a stubborn contributor to inequality. Between 1996 and 2000, poor students fell further behind their wealthier peers in seven out of nine key indicators, including reading, math, and science. These outcomes cry out for a different model, one that helps address funding and equality without raising property taxes; that introduces entrepreneurship and choice into a system of monopolies; and that offers school districts more Federal dollars to implement the requirements of No Child Left Behind with fewer strings--in other words, more Federal dollars, fewer Federal strings, and more parental say over how the Federal dollars are spent. Does this sound too good to be true? I would suggest it is not. Look no further than our Nation's best-in-the-world higher educational system. There we find the Pell Grant Program, which has diversified and strengthened America's colleges and universities by applying the principles of autonomy and competition. This year, $13 billion in Pell grants and work study and $42 billion in student loans will follow America's students to the colleges of their choice. This is in sharp contrast to the local monopolies we have created in kindergarten through the 12th grade education, where dollars flow directly to schools with little or no say from parents. That is why I have proposed Pell Grants for Kids, an annual $500 scholarship that would follow every middle- and low-income child to the school or other accredited academic program of his or her parent's choosing. These are new Federal dollars, so no district would see a cut in its share of Washington's $35 billion annual appropriations for K through 12, and increases in funding for students with disabilities would continue. Armed with new purchasing power, parents could directly support their school's priorities, or they could pay for tutoring, for lessons and other services on the private market. Parents in affluent school districts do this all the time. Pell Grants for Kids would give less wealthy families the same opportunities--an example of such a family are the Holidays in Nashville, TN. Raymon Holiday is a sixth grader who recently won the American Lung Association of Tennessee's clean air poster contest. I was there when he won the 10-speed bicycle you get for winning this poster competition. I met his father, an art major, and his grandfather, a retired art teacher. They told me his great-grandfather was a musician. So you can see where Raymon Holiday gets his instincts. His grandfather, the retired art teacher, lamented to me that art classes are usually the first to go when school budgets are cut. With Pell Grants for Kids, a typical middle school of 600 students where Raymon might be 1 of 500 middle- or low-income students who qualify to receive a $500 Pell Grant. His middle school would see a $250,000 increase in funding. Raymon would be assured of art lessons. The Pell grant model also encourages great American entrepreneurship. Enterprising principals, like Raymon's principal, might design programs to attract parental investment: advanced math classes, writing workshops, afterschool programs, English lessons--whatever is lacking due to funding constraints. Surveys continue to show that while Americans are concerned with the state of public education, most support their own child's public school. Herman Smith, superintendent of schools in Bryan, TX, would welcome the $6 million that would accompany 13,500 eligible Bryan students--90 percent of his district. Bryan is right next door to College Station, home of Texas A&amp;M where, according to Smith, their budget cuts are larger than Bryan dreams of spending for new programs and personnel. Property values there are double those in Bryan, as is the per-pupil expenditure. Not surprisingly, Bryan's population is almost half African American or Latino, while College Station is three-quarters white. With 30 million American schoolchildren eligible for Pell Grants for Kids, my fellow fiscal conservatives are probably raising an eyebrow. But please listen. Every year, Congress appropriates increases in funding for kindergarten through the 12th grade. What I am offering here is a plan to earmark most of these new dollars--aside from increases for spending for children with disabilities--for parents to spend on educational programs of their choice. Otherwise, we will continue to invest in the same bureaucracies that have disappointed poor and minority families for too long. Pell Grants for Kids could be implemented gradually, starting with kindergarten and first grade at an initial cost of $2.5 billion. If the program had been in place during President Bush's first 2 years in office, the extra $4.5 billion spent on K- through-12 education--again, not counting another $3 billion for children with disabilities--would have created $500 scholarships for all 9 million middle- and low-income students through the third grade. We have had 50 years to deliver an American education on equal terms to all students. But a baffling commitment to the status quo has prevented us from living up to Brown's noble legacy. This anniversary presents the perfect opportunity to inaugurate a new era, one that uses the strategy that helped to create the best colleges to help create the best schools. Let us start with Pell Grants for Kids and move on from there ``with all deliberate speed.'' I would like to make two or three additional remarks about Pell Grants for Kids. As I mentioned, the idea is a pretty simple one--significantly new Federal dollars, fewer Federal strings, and more say by parents about how the money is spent. To give you an idea of how much money that would be, I have taken a quick look in my home State of Tennessee. Tennessee has 938,000 students in kindergarten through the 12th grade. Pell Grants for Kids would be eligible to all those students who are from families below the state median income. The state median income for a family of four in Tennessee is about $56,000. So for families who have an income of $56,000 or below, each of their children would have a $500 scholarship that would follow that child to the school or other approved academic program of their parents' choice. We estimate about 60 percent of all of Tennessee students would be eligible for a $500 Pell grant. In some of the rural counties where there are a great many poor children, it might be 90 percent of the students. In other counties--Davidson, Maryville, Oak Ridge--it might be a smaller percentage. But all in all, there should be about 562,000 students in Tennessee who would be eligible. This would bring an additional $281 million to Tennessee for K-12 education, and parents would have a say over how that money is spent. Often when this issue comes up and we talk about spending more Federal dollars for local schools, the Senators on my side of the aisle get a little hot under the collar. We do not want to spend any more Federal money for local schools. On the other hand, when we say let's give the parents more say on how the money is spent, the collars get a little hot on the other side of the aisle because they are reluctant to give parents more choice. This is a conflict of principles. It is the principle of equal opportunity--giving parents more choices. But there is another valid principle on the other side. It is called E pluris unum. We have public schools, common schools, to teach our common culture, and we do not want to harm them. It is a proper debate in this body to say let's ask questions if we are giving parents more say, more choices. Will that harm our common schools? And there is a proper way to ask in this Senate: Can we wisely spend that much more money? This is quite a bit more money. Fully funded Pell grants for kids programs would cost 15 billion in new Federal dollars a year. It would add about $500 to the $600 we now spend on each of the children in America today from the Federal Government. Only about 7 or 8 percent of the dollars we spend on children comes from the Federal Government. So it would be about a 70-percent increase in Federal funding for every middle- or low-income child fully funded. We are proposing to do this over a long period of time. Basically, to add to the new money that we would appropriate every year for K-12, and give most of that to Pell grants for kids. This would create more equality in funding for poor districts. It would especially help African-American and minority kids. It would provide extra dollars to implement the standards of No Child Left Behind, and it would introduce for the first time into our K-12 system the principle that has created the best colleges in the world, the idea of letting money follow students to the institution of their choice. Over the next several weeks, I will be discussing this with individual Senators.

She is strongly supported by both New York Senators, yet the nomination continues to languish without consideration. Three additional outstanding Second Circuit nominees are pending before the Judiciary Committee and await their confirmation hearings. Judge Rosemary Pooler was nominated back on November 6, 1997, as was Robert Sack, a partner in the law firm of Gibson Dunn &amp; Crutcher. The final pending nomination to the Second Circuit was received two months ago, back on February 11, when the President nominated Chester J. Straub, a partner in the law firm of Wilkie Farr &amp; Gallagher. I have been urging action on the nominees to the Second Circuit for many months. The Senate is failing in its obligations to the people of the Second Circuit, to the people of New York, Connecticut and Vermont. We should call an end to this stall and take action. Last Friday I urged consideration of the nomination of Judge Sotomayor without further delay and requested that the Judiciary Committee proceed to hold the necessary hearings on the three other Second Circuit nominees this week so that they, too, might be confirmed before the upcoming recess. I do not believe that the Senate should be leaving for two weeks' recess and leaving the Second Circuit with vacancies for which it has qualified nominations pending. This is too reminiscent of the government shutdown only a couple of years ago and the numerous times of late when the Republican congressional leadership has recessed without completing work on emergency supplemental and disaster relief legislation. In his most recent Report on the Judiciary the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court warned that persisting vacancies would harm the administration of justice. The Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court pointedly declared: ``Vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice that traditionally has been associated with the federal judiciary.'' The people and businesses in the Second Circuit need additional federal judges confirmed by the Senate. Indeed, the Judicial Conference of the United States recommends that in addition to the 5 vacancies, the Second Circuit be allocated an additional 2 judgeships to handle its workload. The Second Circuit is suffering harm from Senate inaction. That is why the Chief Judge of the Second Circuit had to declare the Circuit in a state of emergency. Must we wait for the administration of justice to disintegrate further before the Senate will take this crisis seriously and act on the nominees pending before it? I hope not. As part of my efforts to encourage the Senate to do its job, I am today introducing the Judicial Emergency Responsibility Act. The purpose of this bill is to supplement the law by which Chief Justice Winter certified the emergency and to require the Senate to do its duty and to act on judicial nominations before it recesses for significant stretches of time when a Circuit Court is suffering from a vacancy emergency. I urge prompt action on the bill and immediate action on the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Second Circuit. S. 1907.

I draw my colleagues' particular attention to what has recently been reported in the newspaper about one of the most recent uses of sarin gas that has occurred and its possibility of being used in the United States. I commend my colleagues for bringing this bill to the Senate, for a chance to talk about it. It is a very important issue. I see in this particular section our need to assess this. The discovery and confirmation of sarin gas in artillery shells in Iraq highlights evidence that Saddam Hussein had a weapons of mass destruction program that was not only fully operational but ready for use against U.S. troops. I raise this for two reasons. One, the argument that we have not been able to find WMD in Iraq is ongoing. I hope we will not dismiss the lack of any findings in the past and what we are finding now, the actual use of sarin gas against our troops. That should continue to be a focus that we hunt for, and we should be vigilant in looking for weapons of mass destruction, particularly chemicals such as sarin gas. But more importantly, Iraq had told the U.N. weapons inspection team they had produced tons of sarin gas and other chemical weapons. We should be concerned about where those are today and whether some of them may have found their way into Syria or other countries.

After 25 years of dedicated service to our country, Captain Dudley B. Berthold of the United States Navy will retire on August 8 of this year. I would like to take a moment to recognize his accomplishments. Captain Berthold is the son of retired USAR, Brigadier General Julius L. Berthold. I am pleased to say he attended the University of Louisville as an NROTC Midshipman and graduated in 1978. Upon graduation he was commissioned as an Ensign in the U.S. Navy, and shortly after completing Surface Warfare Officer School he reported to his first assignment on board the USS O'Bannon, DD 987, serving first as Auxiliary Officer and then as the Main Propulsion Assistant. Captain Berthold began his extensive study in aircraft carrier design in 1982, when he enrolled in the Naval Postgraduate School of Monterey, CA, and earned an MS degree in Mechanical Engineering. He was selected for the Naval Nuclear Power Training Program, which led to training assignments at the Naval Nuclear Power School in Orlando, FL, and the Nuclear Prototype Propulsion Plant Training Unit in Ballston Spa, NY. His assignments took him from the decks of the USS Theodore Roosevelt, CVN 71, where he served as the Electrical Officer, to the shores of Virginia where, in 1989, he was assigned as the Aircraft Carrier New Construction Principle Assistant Project Officer on the staff of the Supervisor of Shipbuilding at Newport News. Here, he assisted in the planning and execution of the construction, test &amp; trials, and delivery of the USS George Washington, CVN 73. On later tours, he oversaw the delivery of both the USS Harry S Truman, CVN 75, and the USS Ronald Reagan, CVN 76. Most recently, Captain Berthold served as Program Manager for the Navy's future aircraft carrier programs at the Navy's Program Executive Office for Aircraft Carriers in Newport News, VA. He has played a key role in developing new and innovative acquisition strategies for the design and construction of the final Nimitz Class Aircraft Carrier, USS George H W Bush, CVN 77, and the new CVN 21 class. This new class of aircraft carrier design sets a new standard for war-fighting capability and will influence the readiness of our military throughout the 21st century. Captain Berthold has earned a great number of personal decorations, including the Meritorious Service Medal with three Gold Stars, the Navy Commendation Medal with one Gold Star, and the Navy Achievement Medal. I am proud to represent such a fine Kentuckian in the U.S. Senate, and I thank him for his dedication to the people of the United States. His list of accomplishments is great, yet being the son of retired USAR, Brigadier General Bud Berthold, whom I consider to be a close personal friend and wonderful role model, certainly ranks high on that list. While the Navy will lose a loyal seaman, his wife, Deborah Lynn, and two children, Bryant and Bridgette, will welcome him home with open arms. I wish Captain Dudley B. Berthold the traditional naval wish of ``Fair winds and Following seas'' as his military career comes to an end. And I congratulate him on his retirement.","word.count":536,"sep11":1.93258426966292,"years":2003.79213483146,"days":3130,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.497218565901532,"Topic 2":0.0655653258925931,"Topic 3":0.0127584190468853,"Topic 4":0.344770104343277,"Topic 5":0.00682326693909963,"Topic 6":0.00623328248461902,"Topic 7":0.0329315319684497,"Topic 8":0.0153619105832539,"Topic 9":0.0133138516043557,"Topic 10":0.00502374123593432},{"id":"10820030085698","body":"Robert Byrd: Mr. President, I have long had an interest in helping to open international energy technology markets and in expanding the export of a range of U.S. clean energy technologies.

This was accomplished with wording that took less than one-third of a page, without any nitpicking arguments over precise language, yet it was a clear declaration of who the enemy was and what had to be done. And in 3\\1/2\\ years, this was accomplished. A similar resolve came from the declaration of war against Japan 3 days earlier. Likewise, a clear-cut victory was achieved against Japan. Many Americans have been forced into war since that time on numerous occasions, with no congressional declaration of war and with essentially no victories. Today's world political condition is as chaotic as ever. We're still in Korea and we're still fighting the Persian Gulf war that started in 1990. The process for our entering war the past 57 years and the inconclusive results of each war since that time are obviously related to Congress' abdication of its responsibility regarding war, given to it by article I section 8 of the Constitution. Congress has either ignored its responsibility entirely over these years, or transferred the war power to the executive branch by a near majority vote of its Members, without consideration of it by the States as an amendment required by the Constitution. Congress is about to circumvent the Constitution and avoid the tough decision of whether war should be declared by transferring this monumental decisionmaking power regarding war to the President. Once again, the process is being abused. Odds are, since a clear-cut decision and commitment by the people through their Representatives are not being made, the results will be as murky as before. We will be required to follow the confusing dictates of the U.N., since that is where the ultimate authority to invade Iraq is coming from--rather than from the American people and the U.S. Constitution. Controversial language is being highly debated in an effort to satisfy political constituencies and for Congress to avoid responsibility of whether to go to war. So far the proposed resolution never mentions war, only empowering the President to use force at his will to bring about peace. Rather strange language indeed! A declaration of war limits the presidential powers, narrows the focus and implies a precise end point to the conflict. A declaration of war makes Congress assume the responsibilities directed by the Constitution for this very important decision, rather than assume that if the major decision is left to the President and a poor results occurs, it will be his fault, not that of Congress. Hiding behind the transfer of the war power to the executive through the War Powers Resolution of 1973 will hardly suffice. However, the modern way we go to war is even more complex and deceptive. We must also write language that satisfies the U.N. and all our allies. Congress gladly transfers the legislative prerogatives to declare war to the President, and the legislative and the executive branch both acquiesce in transferring our sovereign rights to the U.N., an unelected international government. No wonder the language of the resolution grows in length and incorporates justification for starting this war by citing U.N. resolutions. In order to get more of what we want from the United Nations, we rejoined UNESCO, which Ronald Reagan had bravely gotten us out of, and promised millions of dollars of U.S. taxpayer support to run this international agency started by Sir Julian Huxley. In addition, we read of promises by our administration that one we control Iraqi oil, it will be available for allies like France and Russia, who have been reluctant to join our efforts. What a difference from the days when a declaration of war was clean and precise and accomplished by a responsible Congress and an informed people. A great irony of all this is that the United Nations Charter doesn't permit declaring war, especially against a nation that has been in a state of peace for 12 years. The U.N. can only declare peace. Remember, it wasn't a war in Korea; it was only a police action to bring about peace. But at least in Korea and Vietnam, there was fighting going on, so it was a bit easier to stretch the language than it is today regarding Iraq. Since Iraq doesn't even have an Air Force or a Navy, is incapable of waging a war, and remains defenseless against the overwhelming powers of the United States and the British, it's difficult to claim that we're going into Iraq to restore peace. History will eventually show that if we launch this attack--just as our sanctions already have--the real victims will be the innocent Iraqi civilians who despise Saddam Hussein and are terrified of the coming bombs that will destroy their cities. The greatest beneficiaries of the attack may well be Osama bin Ladin and the al Qaeda. Some in the media have already suggested that the al Qaeda may be encouraging the whole event. Some unintended consequences do occur, what will come from this attack is still entirely unknown. It's a well-known fact that the al Qaeda are not allies of Saddam Hussein and despise the secularization and partial westernization of Iraqi culture. They would welcome the chaos that's about to come. This will give them a chance to influence post-Saddam-Hussein Iraq. The attack, many believe, will confirm to the Arab world that indeed the Christian West has once again attacked the Muslim East, providing radical fundamentalists a tremendous boost for recruitment. An up or down vote on declaring war against Iraq would not pass the Congress, and the President has no intention of asking for it. This is unfortunate, because if the process were carried out in a constitutional fashion, the American people and the U.S. Congress would vote No on assuming responsibility for this war. Transferring authority to wage war, calling it permission to use force to fight for peace in order to satisfy the U.N. Charter, which replaces article I, section 8 war power provision, is about as close to 1984 ``newspeak'' that we will ever get in the real world. Not only is it sad that we have gone so far astray from our Constitution, but it's also dangerous for world peace and threatens our liberties here at home.","word.count":1057,"sep11":1.08707865168539,"years":2002.94662921348,"days":2829,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0564246750487381,"Topic 2":0.0303871054261397,"Topic 3":0.0109126911063268,"Topic 4":0.706242162638516,"Topic 5":0.00350839108659643,"Topic 6":0.00481142038822502,"Topic 7":0.0235899862184902,"Topic 8":0.0185062984407838,"Topic 9":0.123369510432572,"Topic 10":0.022247759213612},{"id":"10519980027305","body":"Ralph Regula: Mr. Speaker, John Curran in his speech ``Upon the Right of Election'' said, ``Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.''

Lee has been a leader in promoting an appropriate role for Congress in the foreign policy- making process and, at the same time, educating legislators, his colleagues, on world affairs and their need to understand those issues. He nonetheless never has forgotten his roots in the soil of Indiana. Buckeyes and Hoosiers are down to earth people, well grounded, if you will. That grounding in love of country and a profound understanding of its good people augmented Lee's ability to represent our Nation's foreign policy in Congress and overseas. Now he leaves us to embark on a new mission as Director of the Woodrow Wilson Center. I have raised some challenges to the Wilson Center in the past few years, because I believe that the center has strayed from its mission and its dedication to serving the public purpose. With Lee's leadership, I am confident that the Wilson Center will be in good hands and will be responsive to fulfilling its goals. I am also pleased that in this new assignment I will have the opportunity to continue working with Lee. I wish Lee and Nancy the best for their continued success; Lee in the role of inspiring Americans through the Wilson Center; and Nancy in the world of beauty through art.","word.count":332,"sep11":-3.03089887640449,"years":1998.82865168539,"days":1363,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0463478115794838,"Topic 2":0.0468650971990384,"Topic 3":0.462476101473748,"Topic 4":0.0153476934184252,"Topic 5":0.04270317140894,"Topic 6":0.0954639149111124,"Topic 7":0.00308972690993566,"Topic 8":0.187364541740572,"Topic 9":0.074849884925301,"Topic 10":0.0254920564334431},{"id":"10519980079409","body":"Robert Byrd: Mr. President, Senator Specter announced earlier today the release of a voluminous and comprehensive report of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs special investigation unit on Gulf War illnesses. I commend the Senator from Pennsylvania and the other Members of the Committee, including my colleague from West Virginia, Senator Rockefeller, on this report, which was over a year in the making. In great detail, this report and its appendices provide the justification for legislation that Senator Specter, Senator Rockefeller, and I introduced on July 28, S. 2358, the Gulf War Veterans Act of 1998. The history of this sorry saga of war, illness, and bureaucratic bungling it details has not improved with time. Indeed, age has turned this victory wine into sour vinegar, not a vintage to be savored. Since the signing of the cease fire in Iraq in 1991, soldiers have been complaining of symptoms that have been poorly dealt with by the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs. As the years have passed, we have learned that these soldiers, sailors, and airmen had to operate in a toxic atmospheric cocktail of environmental and battlefield hazards, topped off with a chaser of vaccines and pills that may have interacted poorly with all the other hazardous exposures. We have learned that our equipment to detect and protect our troops may not be good enough, and that their training and doctrine is inadequate. We have even learned of the role that the U.S. played in arming Iraq with chemical and biological warfare technology and materials. Finally, DOD and the VA record keeping was poor, the databases inadequately designed and incompatible, so that the ability to identify battlefield exposures--when known--is not available to the VA when requested by a sick soldier. We won the war, but the price paid by these soldiers has been unacceptably high, perhaps needlessly high. And DOD and the VA have done little to correct the problems. The official motto seems to be ``That which does not kill us, we ignore--unless forced to address it.'' Like other Members, I have tried to correct these matters as they have come to light. I successfully offered an amendment to ensure DOD and the Intelligence Community consultation when pathogens useful to a biological warfare program are approved for export, so that we have a better opportunity to track countries that have the capability, if not the intent, to produce biological warfare agents. I obtained funding for the first peer-reviewed scientific studies of the possible health effects of exposure to low levels of chemical warfare agents. An amendment I authored that was adopted by the Senate but rejected in conference would have provided military health care to the children of Gulf War veterans born with birth defects that might be linked to their parent's wartime exposures. This year, I offered amendments to the Department of Defense authorization bill to improve the oversight and approval process for granting waivers to use investigational drugs without informed consent of the troops, and to require a review of chemical warfare defense doctrine to address exposure to low levels of chemical warfare agents. This last effort is based on a soon-to-be released General Accounting Organization study that I requested last year in conjunction with Senator Levin and Senator Glenn. I am sorry to say that, despite DOD's 1996 show of concern over possible chemical exposures at Khamisiyah [Kam-ih-see-yah] and other Iraqi sites that may have resulted in the exposure of U.S. personnel to varying levels of chemical warfare agents, little has been done to address the lack of training that should better enable our troops to recognize and take effective action to protect themselves from these potential health threats. We have also requested GAO to look into the adequacy of U.S. detection and protection equipment and efforts to address hazardous, but not lethal, levels of chemical and biological warfare agents. This study will be completed next year. While I hope that my efforts and the efforts of other Members and Committees can push DOD and the VA into facing the serious new health consequences of war on the modern battlefield, even these cannot adequately substitute for an epiphany in those departments that will result in a sincere and thorough examination of this issue, and in proactive and coordinated steps to correct the deficiencies outlined in this comprehensive report. There is no smoking gun in this report, no explosive new evidence that says ``whodunit'' and why. But like previous reports by Congress, the GAO, and the Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Illnesses, this report confirms that our veterans were exposed to a poison cocktail of hazardous materials, that many are now ill, and that the bureaucratic response has been slow and stumbling. It is likely that there will never be a clear and final answer for our sick soldiers and their families as to exactly what ails them. But this report does offer many corrective recommendations aimed at preventing the veterans of the next war from having to go through the years of frustration and outrage that the sick veterans of the Persian Gulf War have endured. It also offers a solid foundation to move forward and address the legitimate health concerns of Persian Gulf veterans that are contained in S. 2358, the Persian Gulf Veterans Act of 1998. Gulf War veterans in West Virginia and across the country are getting sick as a result of their participation in the Gulf War, which may have exposed them to a variety of hazardous materials and chemicals while serving their country. But instead of receiving medical care, these veterans are given bureaucratic excuses. It is time to end the litany of excuses and to give our veterans the health care they deserve. I again thank my friend from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter, for his efforts, and the efforts and my colleague from West Virginia, Mr. Rockefeller. I congratulate and thank the committee for its efforts. I look forward to the successful passage of S. 2358. Mr. President, I thank my friend, Mr. Specter, for his courtesy in allowing me to proceed at this point. I now yield the floor.","word.count":1021,"sep11":-3.10674157303371,"years":1998.75280898876,"days":1336,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0199010376532628,"Topic 2":0.512725547854394,"Topic 3":0.00886380886775878,"Topic 4":0.0223814478754524,"Topic 5":0.0133650906854732,"Topic 6":0.00229417653581672,"Topic 7":0.00389042929698866,"Topic 8":0.00936175067923107,"Topic 9":0.0121222981986396,"Topic 10":0.395094412352983},{"id":"10519970027735","body":"Karen McCarthy: Mr. Chairman, I rise today and offer an amendment to H.R. 4194 that will adjust HUD housing opportunities for persons with AIDS back to fiscal year 1998 levels and invest more money in the Department of Veterans Affairs grants for construction of State extended-care facilities. Mr. Chairman, I must first acknowledge the hard work of the gentleman from California and his counterpart on the other side of the aisle and the members of the committee and their staff for all the hard work on this bill. I know they did everything they could to come up with a balanced budget. I think it is pretty balanced. But I just have one small amendment I want to make, and it is very simple. As has been said many times on the floor this afternoon, we have a severe shortage of veterans care facilities, both health care and these type of housing facilities. This program is used to provide matching grants to States to construct State home facilities, to provide a home or nursing home care to veterans. These grants may also be used to expand, remodel or alter existing facilities that provide those needs to veterans or that provide hospital care to veterans in State homes. The need for veterans care facilities continues to increase at a rapid pace as the veterans population continues to age. The number of veterans 65 and over is expected to peak in the year 2000 at 9.3 million. H.R. 4194 in its present form appropriates $80 million for this program, the same as last year, while the number of veterans who need this program has dramatically risen. To fully fund the extended- care needs of our veterans in this country for fiscal year 1999 we would need $152 million. My amendment does not even meet that level of assistance, but it does transfer $21 million toward that goal. This additional money would provide grants to assist States in constructing State home facilities. My amendment transfers $21 million from the base bill's increase in housing for persons with AIDS. My amendment does not cut dollars from housing opportunities for Persons With AIDS program. It simply freezes that program at fiscal year 1998 levels. While the number of aging veterans who require this program continues to increase at a rapid pace, the most recent data shows that the annual number of new AIDS cases declined by 6 percent. Once again, the base bill increases funding for housing opportunities for persons with AIDS by 21 million over fiscal year 1998 levels while the base bill freezes funding for veterans housing at fiscal year 1998 levels even though the number of veterans who need this housing has increased dramatically. My amendment transfers the increase in funding to veterans housing and leaves housing for those with AIDS frozen at the fiscal year 1998 level. I want my colleagues to know that the American Legion fully supports this effort to increase VA grants for construction of State extended- care facilities by this $21 million. I ask my colleagues to consider what is at hand and make the right choice, and I urge a strong vote on this amendment.","word.count":312,"sep11":-4.12359550561798,"years":1997.73595505618,"days":974,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.304764720962717,"Topic 2":0.0197974121476426,"Topic 3":0.0744954196764838,"Topic 4":0.0654986312348902,"Topic 5":0.111061302663444,"Topic 6":0.00805480256233708,"Topic 7":0.276754415643576,"Topic 8":0.116862099257932,"Topic 9":0.00614709294688769,"Topic 10":0.0165641029040893},{"id":"10920060022427","body":"Paul Kanjorski: Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. While the supporters of H.R. 2990 have tinkered with and somewhat improved the bill since its introduction, the central provision of the legislation, in the words of the Consumer Federation of America, is ``fatally flawed.'' I am likewise very concerned that this bill sacrifices the quality of independent assessments of financial strength provided by the ``nationally recognized'' credit raters that help our capital markets remain vibrant. As a result, I am offering a substitute. Unlike H.R. 2990, which creates an untested system for establishing nationally recognized agencies, this alternative expedites and builds upon existing regulatory, private sector, and international reform efforts. The voluntary registration regime of H.R. 2990 will increase the number of nationally recognized agencies without assuring the credibility and reliability of the issued ratings. We must seek equilibrium, balancing the desire to increase the quantity of approved agencies with the need to ensure high-quality ratings. The substitute addresses this shortcoming. Moreover, H.R. 2990 ignores ongoing reform efforts. The Securities and Exchange Commission has a rulemaking pending on these matters. Currently, approved raters are also developing a voluntary, robust self-regulatory regime based on the industry code established by the International Organization of Securities Commissions. Moreover, the European Commission recently relied on this global code to oversee its approved rating agencies. Congress should build upon these domestic, private sector, and international reform efforts rather than creating chaos by forging a new regulatory plan. To ensure the advancement of good public policy in this area, we need to recognize the work of others. We also ought to provide for the continued legislative oversight of these matters and minimize unintended consequences. Specifically, the substitute would require the commission to complete its definitional rulemaking on what constitutes an approved rating agency within 60 days of enactment. It would also require the commission to establish public guidance about the process used to identify new, nationally recognized agencies within 180 days of enactment. The substitute would additionally encourage participating parties to expedite and complete their discussions over the voluntary framework to improve market discipline and enhance rating quality. Finally, it would require annual hearings before the Financial Services Committee to explore the need for further action. In short, the substitute establishes a globally consistent market- based approach. It protects the quality of ratings, enhances competition, and injects transparency into the process for determining nationally recognized agencies. It also promotes international harmonization; ensures that Congress stays focused on these matters; and gives the commission, which has the foremost expertise on these issues, a seat at the table in developing any future bill. In Monday's Bond Buyer, the head of JPMorgan's rating advisory group opined that efforts related to the rulemaking to defined approved rating agencies and to establish a voluntary framework consistent with global standards offers a ``positive solution'' to present concerns. We should heed his advice to balance quality and quantity concerns in order to ensure that investors benefit from the best thinking and the best opinions by passing this substitute. In sum, Mr. Chairman, the substitute pursues a more prudent course that accelerates and adds to ongoing domestic, private sector, and international reform efforts instead of creating an untested system for establishing nationally recognized agencies. This alternative would also protect investors by ensuring high-quality ratings. It is the better approach, and I urge its adoption. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.","word.count":571,"sep11":4.95786516853933,"years":2006.81741573034,"days":4207,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.130978744181043,"Topic 2":0.0612859845636524,"Topic 3":0.0618199589629504,"Topic 4":0.0175237545667152,"Topic 5":0.00807255042862409,"Topic 6":0.165408184338912,"Topic 7":0.0102389932961309,"Topic 8":0.0866442149009882,"Topic 9":0.393462001550803,"Topic 10":0.0645656132101804},{"id":"10419960022754","body":"Thomas M.

At a time when critical funding for children, for health care, for education is being slashed to the bone, how can we even think of providing even another cent to the tobacco industry? Smoking and its impact on health costs billions of dollars every year, and it costs thousands of lives in the United States of America. The prior speaker said that it is lawfully grown, it is lawfully sold, it is lawfully consumed. I agree to that, and that is one of the sad problems that we have in this Nation today, because it is lawfully grown, lawfully sold, and lawfully consumed. Just ask one of the members of the thousands of families, many of whom we know very well, who have lost a parent, a daughter, a son, or a wife to smoking-related cancer, and they will give you the straight answer. No more money for tobacco. Simply, no more money for tobacco. Yet, in vote after vote on the House floor and in committee, aid to the tobacco industry stays alive. This is wrong. Let us make some smart choices on how we spend our Federal dollars. This amendment gives us a choice. We can vote for tobacco and smoking, or we can invest in health. This amendment takes the money the bill would spend on tobacco and invests these dollars in linking rural underserved educational and medical facilities to more advanced urban centers. Moreover, it would make significant investment in the rural water and sewer grant and loan programs. The choice is clear.

The Senate is going to continue, for apparently 2 additional weeks, and try to adjourn for the year and finish the 105th Congress on October 9th or October 10th. In the 2 short weeks that remain, I am told that we will consider H.R. 10, the financial modernization bill, fast-track trade authority for new trade treaties, and a substantial tax cut. I want to describe how easy it is, with a small amount of time left, to make big mistakes. I am mindful there will be much disagreement about these three items. And I am also mindful back in my hometown one of the older fellas who was the wise sage said, ``It's hard to tell the difference between the open minded and the empty headed. They dress alike.'' Let me describe these three issues and tell you what I think is empty headed about the attempt to try to pass these three pieces of legislation in the final 2 weeks of a legislative session. First, H.R. 10, the Financial Services Act of 1998. H.R. 10 is a huge piece of legislation that deals with the financial institutions of this country and the methods by which they are involved in various kinds of activities. We have had some experience in this country with the mixing of different kinds of enterprises--banks whose deposits are insured to $100,000, by the American taxpayer I might say; banks, those who are speculating in real estate, those who are involved in securities activities, those who are selling insurance; those kinds of financial activities. We have had some experience in this country putting a number of those together in one institution and then seeing, through speculation, one part of the institution weakening and eroding the other part of the institution that caused massive bank failures in our country. The result was in the 1930s and this country said let's not forget what happened here. Let's not allow this to happen again, and let's create certain circumstances that would prevent us from merging banking enterprises whose very existence depends on the perception of safety and soundness--not unsafety and soundness, but on whether people perceive the institution to be safe and sound. Their very existence depends on that. Let's not threaten again the banking institutions by fusing together financial conglomerates that merge banks with the more speculative enterprises of securities and insurance, or even commerce. The American public has in this century paid a heavy price for the mistakes in those areas and put together walls in the form of legislation to prevent it from happening again. H.R. 10 is an attempt to bring the walls down. It says, ``Let's create a kind of financial fruit salad here. Let's decide we can merge all of these again. We can put all of these together and we can build firewalls, and you'll never feel the heat in between and it will never threaten bank institutions and the American taxpayer will not be put at risk.'' I guarantee you this, that if this Congress passes in the final hours, H.R.10, financial modernization legislation, it will result almost immediately in exacerbating the orgy of mergers that now exists in this country with big banks, and an orgy of mergers that will not only include banks, but will continue to include, at a greater pace, banks with the other kinds of financial enterprises I just described. And 20 years or 30 years from now they will look back at this Congress and this period and say, ``How on Earth could they have thought that that made sense? How could they have possibly thought that was in the public interest? How could they have forgotten the lessons that they learned in the 1920s and 1930s that resulted in the legislation that had protected us?'' I know that there are some big interests around this town who want this bill to pass. There is a great deal of lobbying on its behalf. But I feel so strongly that to do this in the final 2 weeks of a legislative session would have such enormous consequences and pose such substantial risks for our country that I am going to resist with all of my effort the motion to proceed and in every other way to see if we cannot slow this train down on behalf of the American citizens. I know it sounds attractive. I know some say, ``This is creating a new financial blueprint for our institutions for the future, allowing them to compete at home and abroad. It's now a global economy.'' What it is is forgetting the lessons of the past. It will be a replay, in some ways, of the Garn-St Germain bill of the early 1980s in which they unhitched the S&amp;Ls and said, It is OK. You go broker deposits. You load up with risky junk bonds. You can become Roman candles. Take a small S&amp;L and turn it into a giant S&amp;L with broker deposits, and you can do a whole range of other things, and it is fine--and the American taxpayer got stuck with a nearly $500 billion bailout for that fiasco. If this bill passes, there will be massive, massive mergers once again. And they have already been going on at an unprecedented and unhealthy pace in the banking industry and other related financial industries. So that is one big mistake I hope this Congress will avoid in the remaining days of this session. And to the extent I have the energy to be able to help them avoid it, I intend to try to do that. Second is fast track. I know that also has a lot of support, fast- track trade authority. Just the very words ``fast track'' connote lack of preparation. Fast track, fast food--you just go down the line on what ``fast'' precedes, and it describes well ``fast track.'' Fast track means you create a trade agreement negotiated in secret, behind locked doors someplace, probably in most cases overseas, and bring it to Congress and say to Congress, ``You weren't there when we negotiated this trade agreement, but you have no right to offer amendments to it.'' The last three trade agreements under fast track have been incompetent. I voted against all three. In each case we have, as a result of it, had higher and higher trade deficits--Canada, Mexico, GATT--record trade deficits. This country is choking on trade deficits. I think to bring fast track to the floor of the House and the Senate in the final 2 weeks is regrettable. I will, again, to the extent I have any capability of slowing this down, there will be nothing fast about it. If I can create a legislative bog through which they cannot pull this fast track, I guarantee you I will object to every circumstance that allows anybody to short-circuit any amount of time to try to get fast track through this Congress. It is not in this country's interest to continue that kind of trade policy. The third item is an $80 billion tax cut paid for with Social Security trust funds. Some say, ``Well, that's not the way it's paid for.'' Show me the money. Where do you get the money? You get the money for a big tax cut by taking Social Security trust funds that are in a fund that is preceded by the word ``trust.'' Taking those trust funds and saying these now represent the resources by which we can offer a tax cut is not the way to do this country's business. When we have that debate--and I expect we will next week or the week after--it will be an aggressive debate because some of us are fiercely determined never to let that happen. I recall when we had the constitutional amendment to balance the budget on the floor of the Senate, I voted against it. In fact, it lost by one vote. Had some folks pretty upset with that vote. I said, ``It's not that I don't want to balance the budget, I do.'' I helped play a role in balancing or nearly balancing this country's budget, not by writing something in the Constitution, but by doing the kinds of things you need to do on a day- to-day basis, to do things on taxing and spending that really does balance the budget. But to write into the Constitution a proviso that says, ``Let's balance the budget by describing all revenue coming in as operating revenue'' is to mistreat the Social Security trust funds once again. And to actually write it in the Constitution of the United States, that does not make any sense to me. It does not make any sense to me in the final 2 weeks of a legislative session coming up to an election for anybody to say we are going to package up $80 billion in tax cuts so we can say to the American people we are offering tax cuts, when in fact the money by which they offer these tax cuts is to take the money out of the Social Security trust funds and make them available for tax cuts. Those moneys are not available. Those moneys were collected from paychecks in this country. The paychecks are a result of the work of the American people, and they are told ``We're going to take some money from that paycheck to put into a trust fund because it is needed when you retire to make Social Security viable.'' Then somebody comes along and says we are changing the words ``trust fund''; we will just drop ``trust.'' Maybe we should amend that to the extent they want to bring $80 billion in tax cuts to the floor, paid for by Social Security trust funds. Perhaps we ought to require them to take the ``trust'' out of the trust fund name. That will, in my judgment, certainly abridge the trust that is supposed to exist with those trust funds. Those are three big mistakes in a very short time. The potential, in a small amount of time, to make big mistakes is very substantial: H.R. 10, fast track, and tax cuts. I have a lot of things I want to get done, others have a lot of things they want to do, and in most cases we work closely together and have good relationships, but on large public policy issues like this it seems to me we ought to be very careful. I feel very strongly about all three of these areas. All three, in my judgment, would be a mistake. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.","word.count":1798,"sep11":-3.03932584269663,"years":1998.8202247191,"days":1360,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0783215494398094,"Topic 2":0.138459802652144,"Topic 3":0.00638135892377253,"Topic 4":0.00865901074634498,"Topic 5":0.0294112326049702,"Topic 6":0.00416558828464294,"Topic 7":0.576043858822857,"Topic 8":0.011979027039015,"Topic 9":0.143640098111797,"Topic 10":0.00293847337464693},{"id":"10820030032051","body":"Maurice Hinchey: Mr. Speaker, the Constitution of the United States is the single greatest foundation of law in history.

For 215 years the U.S. Constitution has protected the rights of the American people; the right to assemble, the right to worship, the right to speak freely, and we ought to pass a constitutional amendment that gives equal rights to women. Instead, today we are debating a constitutional amendment that would curtail a right. Our predecessors tried this once in the 20th century. Fourteen years later they had to unamend the Constitution by rolling back prohibition. Our Constitution is silent on marriage, and that is good, because the American people's definition of what is an acceptable marriage has evolved over the years. A marriage once signified that a woman had no legal identity apart from her husband. Within the last 100 years, over a dozen States prohibited marriages between those of a European and Asian decent, and the Supreme Court overruled laws barring interracial marriage less than four decades ago. No constitutional amendment stood in the way of those changes. Laws governing families and marriage have always been determined by State governments. Dozens of States are already dealing with this issue. It is federalism in action. Many of this constitutional amendment's supporters have preached the virtues of federalism on other issues. You cannot be a federalist except when federalism is inconvenient. This is not governing on principle, it is practicing the politics of expedience and divisiveness right before a major election, and we should know better than to play politics with the United States Constitution.","word.count":316,"sep11":2.10393258426966,"years":2003.96348314607,"days":3191,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.212733958337627,"Topic 2":0.326456351560439,"Topic 3":0.0807720390995747,"Topic 4":0.125304450382157,"Topic 5":0.167386929116012,"Topic 6":0.0122544809119515,"Topic 7":0.00769489889272428,"Topic 8":0.0482320623303283,"Topic 9":0.00996392469334235,"Topic 10":0.00920090467584311},{"id":"10820040013248","body":"Phil Gingrey: Mr. Speaker, since May 3, the first day that seniors could sign up for a Medicare prescription drug discount card, I have had the opportunity to hold workshops at senior centers in Smyrna, Cedartown, Rome, Cartersville, Talbotton, and Thomaston, all cities in Georgia's 11th Congressional District.

We are in bipartisan agreement on this issue. It is the deepest form of process where we must be able to rely upon each other's commitment and signature. We cannot let that shake. There are all kinds of differences in this Senate. Sometimes between Democrats and Republicans, sometimes between Democrats and Democrats, between Republicans and Republicans. There are differences between us and other Members of the Senate. When a signature is affixed, when a conference report is signed, we cannot possibly contemplate any change in that conference report even if we agree with it. By the way, as the Senator from South Carolina said, I believe I am in agreement with the principle of the material which they seek to add. I know Senator Warner told me he is in agreement with it in principle. It is bedrock principles. You do not go deeper than this. We also have a rule--I know the Presiding Officer is focused on the issue I want to spend 1 minute on--we have a rule relative to legislating on appropriations, which the Senator made reference to in his remarks. We also have rule XXVIII which has to do with material in a conference report which is out of scope. That rule was abided by so that if anyone ever made a point of order that material in a conference report was out of scope, if the Presiding Officer ruled, the body would not overrule the Presiding Officer. But we made a mistake in the early 1990s when we overruled the Chair. There is material added to conference reports all the time, by the way, which has the agreement of conferees, which is out of scope that has the agreement of conferees. It might not have the agreement of everyone in the body, but everyone in the conference report agrees to it. That happens all the time. But what never happened until that one moment in the early 1990s, a point of order was made that there was material out of scope in a conference report and the point of order was sustained by the Chair. The Chair was overridden. That created havoc around here. So much so that a few years later we restored the rule and we wiped out the precedent which was created by overruling the Chair. That is what the issue is in the defense appropriations bill. That is what this issue is going to be. That is different from legislating on an appropriations bill. Forgive me for getting into the details, but I spent a few days studying the difference and I don't want to waste my effort the last few days to try to understand this distinction. The issue on the appropriations bill, since all of us are friends and we are sitting here on a Saturday evening talking to each other this way, the difference on the appropriations bill and not legislating--I forget the number of the rule, but is not rule XXVIII--there is a different rule from the one that is at issue on defense appropriations. The issue on the defense appropriations bill is whether we would overrule the Chair who will rule that the Arctic drilling issue is out of scope and out of order, and whether we are then going to override that ruling and put us back in the same morass we were in in the early 1990s, which caused us a few years later to reverse that precedent, undo that terrible precedent which actually made our rules into mush. We cannot have a rule which sometimes applies and sometimes does not, we override it every other day and restore it every other day. We cannot operate that way and hold our heads up as being legislators. I thank my Chair and my friends for their patience. Let me close by confirming what the Senator from South Carolina said about the importance of the bill. It increases pay by 3.1 percent, which is half a percent higher than inflation. We have been fighting for that a long time. It increases the death gratuity to all active-duty deaths from $12,000 to $100,000, retroactive to the beginning of Operation Enduring Freedom. It authorizes a new special pay of $435 a month during hospitalization. It authorizes new leave for up to 21 days when adopting a child. We can go on and on. The Senator from South Carolina mentioned a few of them and my friend from Alabama knows this because he works hard on these issues, too. We are trying to put items in here in this bill which are good for the troops, good for their families, good for the Nation, good for our security. We cannot watch this effort go down the drain after it was such a tremendous effort made to finish this bill. We set a record, folks. We had the shortest period of time to do an authorization bill and we had the record number of amendments that we were able to resolve. We set two records on this bill. Those records go down the drain unless the House leadership decides they are not going to try to do something that, as far as I know, has never been done before, which is to insert material in a bill somehow after the signature sheets have been signed. There is a process. If the bill goes to the House and they want to refer it back to conference to consider something, in scope or out of scope, that is their right. But when this threat came that they were looking for a way to insert other matter into this conference report, after we had signed the sheets, Senator Warner--I cannot pay enough tribute to Senator Warner--is taking a very strong stand against the leader of his own party and the House of Representatives. I commend him for it. I hope the leadership of the House will relent and allow us to move forward with this important bill.

The Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency, CSOSA, was established by Congress as part of the District of Columbia Revitalization Act of 1997. CSOSA combines under one helm the previously disparate local functions of pretrial services, parole, adult probation, and post-conviction offender supervision. Following three years of operation as a trusteeship, CSOSA was certified as an independent Federal agency within the executive branch on August 4, 2000. CSOSA, with 950 employees, an annual budget of $132 million, and responsibility for monitoring 21,000 pretrial release defendants annually, 8,000 at any one time, and 15,338 post-conviction offenders on probation or parole, is directed by Paul A. Quander, Jr., who was confirmed by the Senate on July 25, 2002. The legislation we introduce today aims to clarify CSOSA's authority to provide for supervision of offenders from other jurisdictions who chose to live in the District of Columbia and to arrange with other States for supervision of District of Columbia probationers who seek residence in other jurisdictions, including authority to enter into a new Interstate Compact. Among the functions CSOSA absorbed after it was established were the supervision of probationers and parolees from other jurisdictions once their transfer to the District of Columbia was approved. Although not explicitly stated in the law, CSOSA also performs the related function of arranging for the supervision of District of Columbia Code offenders on probation and parole who seek to move from the District of Columbia to reside in other States. Our legislation would add that specific duty to CSOSA's statutory responsibilities. The movement of adult parolees and probationers across State lines is currently controlled by an interstate compact dating back to 1937, which has all 50 States and territories as signatories. A new agreement, the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision, has been drafted to improve accountability, coordination, and enforcement mechanisms among the participating states. As of June 19, 35 States had signed on to the new compact. The District has not done so, primarily because the City itself no longer performs the functions since Congress created CSOSA to do so. Our legislation would provide CSOSA with clear authority to enter into this new compact or any other agreements for interstate supervision with any States which may not become signatories to the new compact. Because a new Compact Commission is now being formed and scheduled to meet in November to begin developing the procedural rules for the new Compact, our legislation will enable CSOSA to actively participate in that process. For this reason, we urge our colleagues to support this bill and vote for enactment this year. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:","word.count":506,"sep11":1.08707865168539,"years":2002.94662921348,"days":2829,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.00856500204571202,"Topic 2":0.284222027238461,"Topic 3":0.00537355966086183,"Topic 4":0.0515159471497374,"Topic 5":0.139878904865934,"Topic 6":0.00769943731806438,"Topic 7":0.00242212168601232,"Topic 8":0.480920617059943,"Topic 9":0.00936436541850729,"Topic 10":0.0100380175567668},{"id":"10419950134774","body":"Larry Craig: Mr. President, I join my colleagues tonight to debate this most important provision of the Senate reconciliation bill that is before us and the Republican proposal that I am so proud to support because of the kind of elements that we have put before the American public as truly positive change, while at the same time recognizing I think some of the very real needs that many of our citizens have. The one that the Senator from New Hampshire has just addressed and the one I will spend some time with this evening that I think is critical for us to understand, of course, is Medicare and the changes we are proposing to bring stability and strength to the system and the kind of choice and independence that the seniors of this country, who are the recipients, the beneficiaries of this program, have expected and deserve to expect from their Medicare program. The Senator from Iowa this evening has introduced a competitive bid bill in the antifraud and abuse provision of Medicare reform, and for a few moments this evening I think it would be very important to spend some time with that and to understand it. The Senator from Michigan has put forth an amendment that addresses many of the provisions and adds to many of the provisions of the Republican proposal as it relates to Medicare reform; that I think is a tremendously positive approach; that in combination with the 10 reforms already in our legislation, when scored by the Congressional Budget Office, represents a proposed savings to Medicare of $4.1 billion. Now, I must say that I am told the amendment of the Senator from Iowa has not been scored, and I wish he were in the Chamber so that I could seek that out with him, and if he returns I will ask him that question, because as we strive to balance the budget and keep ourselves on course as the American people have asked us to, it is important that amendments that come to the floor, if they are credible, if they really want to vote on them, ought to be scored. Ours has been, and it does represent a $4.1 billion savings. What is significant about that is representative of what is going on in health care delivery today in this country and the fact that there are dedicated efforts at defrauding both the American taxpayer and the consumer of Medicare benefits. Senator Cohen was in the Chamber this afternoon or later this evening. He serves as the chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging. I have the privilege of serving on that committee with him. Over the last several years, both he and Senator Pryor, who chaired that committee before him, and I and others who have served on that committee have held a series of hearings to try to ferret out and understand the kind of waste, fraud, and abuse especially being perpetrated on the seniors of this country that would have the kind of impact on Medicare that it currently has. Let me give you a couple of figures, Mr. President. As much as 10 percent of U.S. health care spending or about $100 billion is lost each year to health care fraud and abuse. That is a phenomenal figure. And yet we believe it is reasonably accurate. Over the last 5 years, estimated losses from these fraudulent activities have totaled $408 billion. Now, that is not the only program or benefit that would have gone to the senior. That is tax money. That is the hard-working, tax-paying American citizen's dollar that some charlatan is making off with because they have learned to game the system and because we have not been able to catch them in gaming the system, or at least we certainly have not caught them at the level that I think all of our taxpayers would want. So the 10 provisions that are in our Medicare reform bill, that were spoken to earlier this evening, along with the additional provision in the amendment from the Senator from Michigan, will register a savings of about $5 to $6 billion, and that is significant. That is big dollars where I come from, big dollars in anybody's estimation, and when it comes to delivering health care needs to our seniors, those are truly important dollars. One of the things that is most significant in all of this, while we create brand-new bureaucratic schemes to ferret out all of this, is the very simple concept with which the Senator from Michigan has come forward. That is that individual Medicare beneficiaries report suspected fraud and abuse and we create an incentive program to allow them to do that. Let me tell you why that is important. I think if every Senator would stop for just a moment, they could remember almost instantly that within the last several months they have had 1, 2, 3, 5, 10 letters from Medicare recipients in their State questioning whether their bill was accurate, whether they had been bilked out of a service that was not delivered and whether in fact their account had been charged. Mr. President, less than 3 months ago, a former citizen from my State, who now lives in California, called my office one day. I had not heard from this man in years. He had happened to be from my hometown. He is now retired and living in California, and he had major surgery, and he is on Medicare. For some reason, he thought something was wrong with the billing; that he not only had been overcharged but there were fraudulent charges involved. He sent me all of his material and said, ``Senator, I know I no longer live in your State but we have known each other over the years. Would you look into it?'' Mr. President, we looked into it. It was thousands of dollars of billing that he was questioning. Within a period of about a month, we had discovered, in working with HCFA and working with Medicare, that this was, in fact, fraudulent billing. Now, that is only one example, and I have chosen not to use his name tonight because I did not ask his permission, but I have done that on many occasions in working with my constituents, and I know nearly every Senator in the Senate has. We recognize without question that the current structure of Medicare simply cannot get at the kind of waste, fraud, and abuse that is current and prevalent within the program, and in trying to secure it, trying to make it stable, being able to turn to our citizens and say to them that Medicare will be there in the out years, strong and ready to serve them and their needs, we must get at these programs. They must result in the kinds of savings, more importantly, the kind of tightening up of it, that I think is so critically necessary. So the 10 provisions we have talked about, certainly the one that the Senator from Michigan has offered that creates the incentives for the beneficiaries themselves to become involved, working with Federal, State, and local law enforcement units to combat especially the fraud sides of the program, are going to be increasingly valuable, and this is what I am proud to say we have offered. It has been scored. It saves $4.1 billion over the period of this legislation, and that is of critical need to all of us. Mr. President, may I inquire how many minutes are remaining in my time?","word.count":1264,"sep11":-6.03370786516854,"years":1995.82584269663,"days":294,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.032222422069267,"Topic 2":0.151616120469318,"Topic 3":0.0112007930073248,"Topic 4":0.0455874323379334,"Topic 5":0.00654526714911543,"Topic 6":0.00408011492852923,"Topic 7":0.0104972385470697,"Topic 8":0.0404426577995276,"Topic 9":0.68798412661962,"Topic 10":0.00982382707229425},{"id":"10920060022159","body":"Thomas Allen: Mr. Speaker, hard work and perseverance are supposed to be the key to success in America; yet many people who work full time are barely scraping by, earning just $10,712 per year on the Federal minimum wage, which is now $5.15 an hour and has been at that level for nearly 10 years. That is an income, $10,700, that is $6,000 below the Federal poverty line for a family of three. That number cheats millions of American families and children out of the chance for basic financial stability every year. It directly contradicts what we often describe as the promise of America, that if you work hard and play by the rules, you have a reasonable chance for a life of some prosperity. Families are struggling because the buying power of the minimum wage is now at its lowest level in the last 50 years, the last 50 years. But if you look at the changes that families are undergoing just in the last 10 years, here is what you find. Americans pay 136 percent more to heat their homes and drive their cars than they did 10 years ago when the last minimum wage increase was passed. Health insurance costs have gone up 97 percent during that same period. The cost of a 4-year public university has gone up 77 percent as well. Families who once lived comfortably on their incomes have been steadily falling out of the middle class and into poverty. We need to raise the minimum wage from $5.15 an hour to $7.25 an hour, a level that will really mean something to the parents who are struggling to provide for their children. An increase would boost the wages of 6.6 million workers directly. Another 8.2 million workers earning up to $1 above the minimum wage would also get a boost due to the so-called ``spillover'' effects, and that influence would affect the lives of 54,000 people in my home State of Maine. Despite what some opponents of a wage hike may claim, wages have not risen significantly on their own. They have been eaten away by inflation. Even though the American workforce has increased its productivity by 14 percent over the last 5 years, real wages have gone up by only 2 percent for nonmanagerial workers. Meanwhile, the average CEO in America makes more than 1,000 times the minimum wage. Americans CEOs earn in one day what most workers earn in a year. America prides itself on providing opportunity for all. Yet it is clear that the wealth being generated in our economy is only lifting a few. We need an economic plan that allows our citizens, especially our families and our children, to support themselves, educate themselves and continue to achieve and move forward in their lives. Now, it frankly is an embarrassment that Congress has not addressed the minimum wage issue in almost 10 years, especially in light of the issues that we have found time to address here. Last week, this body gave an estate tax break worth $280 billion to a few thousand wealthy individuals. For the past year, the Republican leadership has been intent on giving more tax breaks for the wealthiest 1 percent and paying for it with cuts in education, Medicare, and other programs on which Americans depend to maintain their quality of life. What does it mean to the average American that Congress has raised its own salary over and over again since 1997, but not the minimum wage? Income inequality in this country is a scandal, and this Congress is contributing to making it greater. This is not only bad for the middle class and lower-income Americans in this country, it is bad for our democracy. Twenty States, including my home State of Maine, and the District of Columbia have already passed increases in the minimum wage. They understand that this is fundamentally an issue of fairness and good economic sense. We need to see this kind of economic leadership at the Federal level as well. We need economic policies that do not leave the majority of our citizens behind. The Republican leadership does not want a minimum wage increase to come to a vote here, but eight in 10 Americans do. They support it. Frankly, I wish this Congress would do as much for the average American as it does for corporations and the wealthiest 1 percent. The minimum wage must allow workers to earn enough to support themselves and their families. $5.15 is not enough to live on. I hope we can finally start to work together on this issue and enact a long, long overdue increase in the minimum wage.","word.count":777,"sep11":4.95505617977528,"years":2006.81460674157,"days":4206,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.593656625051774,"Topic 2":0.181204208084064,"Topic 3":0.0443518168164755,"Topic 4":0.0451946684479209,"Topic 5":0.0195264240644958,"Topic 6":0.0223674685256083,"Topic 7":0.0542281792797322,"Topic 8":0.0169896530097328,"Topic 9":0.016793599809665,"Topic 10":0.00568735691053154},{"id":"10619990068066","body":"Arlen Specter: Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a noble Southern gentleman, Senator Paul Coverdell.

You can tell a lot about a person by his demeanor, and I first grew to like Paul Coverdell simply by watching him. He wore a cloak of peacefulness around him and he radiated kindness. It was rare to see him without a smile. When I began working with him on the ``Small Watershed Dams Rehabilitation'' bill, I realized that my first impressions of him had been accurate. He was, indeed, kind and friendly. It was a pleasure to work with him in a bipartisan manner on an issue that is vital to both of our states. As is obvious by his rise within the leadership of the Republican Party, he was extremely loyal to his Party. But he never let partisanship interfere with his relationships in the Senate.

The point I want to make is, Congress is now like somebody that has been at the scene of an accident. We saw it happen, but now we are pretending we weren't there. Congress is a part of this problem. For 20 years we have underfunded, we have limited human intelligence. We have improperly funded the intelligence community. We have allowed a situation where 80 percent of the money for the intelligence community is under the Department of Defense, not the CIA. Let me give some numbers. During the 1990s, the number of CIA stations declined by 30 percent. The number of agents declined by 40 percent. The volume of intelligence reports decreased by 50 percent. The intelligence community connected the dots, and got it wrong. It was not just our intelligence community that got it wrong--there was a global breakdown in intelligence analysis. The report is not an indictment of the hard-working and dedicated men and women who put their lives on the line, and are charged with connecting the dots. It is a criticism of the process and community at large, and demonstrative of a lack of leadership, oversight, and insufficient investment. The breakdown in intelligence capability evolved over several years. It was recognized in 1976 by a 5-volume report by the Church committee. Our intelligence gathering and analysis capability--especially human intelligence and linguists--was gutted in the 20 years that followed, particularly in the 1990s, when the Congress did not adequately fund the intelligence community. President Clinton relied on this same analysis of the Iraqi threat when he signed the Iraqi Liberation Act. The Congress relied on this same intelligence when we passed several resolutions regarding Iraq; President Bush relied on this intelligence when making his decisions as well. Many have asked whether I want to change my vote given today's assessment of pre-war intelligence--I do not. Saddam Hussein was a mass murderer who used weapons of mass destruction on his own people; supported terrorism and trained terrorists; provided ``bonuses'' to the families of terrorists; a destabilizing factor in the Mideast. Let's not play armchair quarterback by asking ``what would have happened if.'' The country would be much better served if the Congress and the President took action as soon as possible to fix the organization, leadership, and oversight problems that we have with our intelligence community. When the American people read the Intelligence Committee's report, they will see some fundamental things that need to be changed in the intelligence community. First and foremost it is evident that the Director of Central Intelligence does not really control all aspects of the intelligence community. In fact, as I have said, 80 percent of intelligence dollars go to the Department of Defense, not the CIA. Moreover, many of people that lead the 15 agencies that comprise the intelligence community work for the Department of Defense, not the Director of Central Intelligence. To fix this problem, Senator Feinstein and I are about to propose legislation that will establish a Director of National Intelligence--or DNI. The DNI will be a Cabinet-level position that will lead the intelligence community, and be responsible for aggregating intelligence for the President. As for the specific processes that cry out for reform, the report focuses on two in particular. One, layering of uncertain conclusions-- judgments were layered upon other judgments, and specific concerns and uncertainties were simply lost; two, group think--because we knew Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, and used them on his people, any data that appeared to support this continued behavior was viewed favorably, and dissenting data was discounted or underreported. Those ``process'' types of deficiencies quickly lead one to ask: How can the intelligence community provide better oversight and supervision of ``expert'' analysts; and how can the Congress provide more effective oversight of the intelligence community? There are clearly process reforms needed within the intelligence community, and Congress's oversight of that community. I know that Chairman Roberts and Vice Chairman Rockefeller, are very concerned that our intelligence community is broken, and are committed to taking action in the coming weeks and month to address many of the most critical deficiencies. With particular regard to congressional oversight, I believe that there are some fundamental things that need to be changed such as term limits of committee members. Currently, members can only serve on the Senate Intelligence Committee for 8 years. That means that when they know enough to be conversant in the intelligence business, they need to rotate off of the committee. We need intelligence committee members who can speak the lingo and understand the processes. Consequently, term limits need to be eliminated. Also, the jurisdiction of the Intelligence Committee regarding classified matter is sometimes muddied due to overlap with the Armed Services Committee. I submit that a simplified approach to jurisdiction could enhance oversight and accountability. The process of document classification and redaction also needs to be reviewed. When the Intelligence Committee first prepared this report, the CIA recommended that about half of it be redacted. I understand the need to protect the names of sources and intelligence methods. But I can tell you that most of those redactions were not of that nature; they were everyday, unclassified words. The report you see today is less than 20 percent redacted, and the Intelligence Committee is still working with the CIA to release more of the report. Notwithstanding, it is my belief that in matters such as these, the CIA is too close to the intelligence process to provide an objective view of what really needs to be classified. Consequently, I am working with Senator Wyden to propose legislation that will establish a small independent group under the President that will review documents such as this report to ensure that classification decisions are independent and objective. In addition, I urge the President to nominate as soon as possible a candidate to serve as the Director for Central Intelligence. This is a critical time of this Nation as we fight the global war on terrorism, and we need to have effective leadership in-place at the CIA as soon as possible. As we make progress in fixing the intelligence community, I repeat my call to both sides of the aisle to not politicize the issues or the prospective remedies. We owe it to the American people and to the members of the intelligence community to fix the fundamental problems outlined in this report, and create an intelligence community that can best serve the national security interests of the United States. We are part of the problem. Let's find the solution. I yield the floor.","word.count":399,"sep11":1.6938202247191,"years":2003.55337078652,"days":3045,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.148721100095489,"Topic 2":0.653639111315244,"Topic 3":0.00862886436288316,"Topic 4":0.0186550436944854,"Topic 5":0.0143808881458599,"Topic 6":0.0089353367392006,"Topic 7":0.0925978778908803,"Topic 8":0.0097015468504414,"Topic 9":0.0394392736923125,"Topic 10":0.00530095721320384},{"id":"10519980032834","body":"Bill Redmond: Mr. Chairman, I would like to point out in the bill, in section 4, part concerning protection of non-Federal property. ``The decision of the commission regarding the validity of a petition submitted under subsection shall not affect the ownership, title, or rights of owners of any non-Federal lands covered by the petition.''

But I just want to respond to my colleague, Senator Durbin. I don't think he actually meant to say that our soldiers are coming home broken in body and spirit, but he came close. That is not what I am hearing. Go out to Walter Reed. They may have broken bodies and broken bones, but they are not broken in spirit. The night before last, I attended a wonderful ceremony of the 231st birthday of the U.S. Army. I was talking with soldiers there. We were talking about the war and the politics of the Capitol. They are aware of what is going on. I told them that I thought the Congress would not vote for any immediate withdrawal, and indeed we voted yesterday 93 to 6 against any kind of withdrawal requirement for this year. That vote, represents a strong bipartisan consensus of the Senate. One of those soldiers said: I will tell you what we want, Senator; ``We want to win.'' We want to win this war. That is what the American people want, that is what the soldiers who have gone there and sacrificed want, and that is what they believe in. The soldiers who have been there believe in what they have done. They have been courageous in performing their mission. It is difficult for me and for them to understand this idea that we can support the soldiers but not support the mission we sent them on, sent them by a three-fourths vote of this Senate. A majority of Democrats and Republicans voted for this war, and we are going to stay the course, we are going to help our military succeed, and we are going to help them win. The point I pick up more and more as I talk with these soldiers, what I am hearing from them, is they are afraid we are going to mess it up. They believe they are winning. They believe they are doing their job. They believe they will be successful. And they are really worried that this Congress will be the one that will lose its nerve and not stand with them after they put their lives on the line for this country. I believe this is a big deal, and that success in Iraq is important for our Nation. I visited that region recently. I talked to the leaders of Turkey, Kuwait, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. What would it mean for us if we had a disastrous event in Iraq where the terrorists take over that country? What would it mean to their neighbors? What would it mean to the region? All nations of good will know we must succeed. Iraq is stepping up. There are now 260,000 Iraqi soldiers and security personnel in uniform and reaching higher and higher levels of performance. They are doing a much better job every day. They will soon be at 350,000 by the end of this year. They are being better equipped and better trained, and I believe we are doing a much smarter job of imbedding our soldiers with the Iraqi units so we can call in air support, we can provide mentoring, we can provide advice, we can call on other kinds of support, if they need it, to be effective. A majority of the raids and actions that are taking place in Iraq are taking place by the Iraqis. Iraqi soldiers are taking more casualties than American soldiers. We are not babysitting them. This image of millions casting their ballots for a freely elected government of Iraq is not a bad image for us to remember. We need to remember that, and it is important for us, let me note first and foremost, that this Nation not allow the terrorists to win in Iraq. We are going to be successful. But I realize the American people are concerned. They don't like to see violence and continued death. They don't like to see our soldiers at risk. I certainly understand that; neither do I. I have been an admirer of General Abizaid, CENTCOM commander, and his team of generals because General Abizaid has always resisted the temptation to see how many troops we can put in Iraq. He said that is not the way to win this war. We need the right number of troops, and we need to begin to draw them down as soon as it is appropriate to draw them down and lift up the Iraqi Army. That is what we need to do. Some want to have the President set forth a detailed plan so they can criticize it, basically. How will some sort of formalized plan help our soldiers be effective in the battle? It just tells your enemy what you are going to be doing. More importantly, a detailed plan is not going to be permanent. It will have to change because the enemy changes. As soon as you shut off one avenue of enemy success, they take another one and you have to respond to that. That is the history of warfare. That is the way wars have always been fought: you constantly adjust and constantly alter your efforts to be successful toward your ultimate goal of victory. That is what our military is doing. Trying to demand a date from our military to withdraw or trying to demand from them a plan of what they are going to do 5 months from now fails to understand and recognize the nature of this conflict, and this conflict more than most conflicts because we face an asymmetrical enemy, a nontraditional enemy, who knows it cannot stand and fight our military successfully, so it devises devious and sneaky ways to pit one religion against another, to attack American soldiers, to attack the local police, all designed to crumble the Government of Iraq. But it hasn't happened. Iraqis are still signing up and becoming policemen. Iraqis are still signing up and the army is growing. The Government of Iraq has elected, for the first time, their permanent leadership. Prime Minister Maliki is in office. His whole Cabinet now has been established. The two key Cabinet positions on which they spent extra time, Defense and Interior, have now been established, confirmed and voted by the 275 member Parliament. So they have their government now, fully elected, a permanent government, just like any other nation in the world. There is no interim government now. I believe they are going to be successful, and I tell you, it is going to be important for the United States that they are. We have invested a lot; our soldiers have invested a lot. They are proud of what they are doing. They are not broken in spirit. They want to be successful and win. I have some numbers I will share with my colleagues and those around the country who might be listening. In this conflict, the Army has had the largest number of people serving in Iraq, yet their enlistment rate through May of this year was 104.3 percent. They have exceeded their enlistment goals for this year. They have exceeded their reenlistment goals. The Army for a few months did miss their goals, and some critics said it was a broken Army and predicted disaster. The Army said: No, we are not broken, and we are going to meet our goals. For 13 consecutive months, the Army has met its goals. The highest retention reenlistment rates come from the units that have just come back from Iraq and Afghanistan. Staff Sergeant Barr, who was at Walter Reed, was injured by an explosive device. He was punctured by as many as 100 different pieces of shrapnel. He was told he would have difficulty walking and would probably never run again. He said he was going to run again, and he was going back to Iraq with the unit that he came with. And he worked at it and he worked at it and he ran. He eventually went back to Iraq and served again. That is the kind of spirit that we have. That is the kind of spirit that you see in our Army. I was told by an officer who knew that story that every single soldier in his squad reenlisted. This is the spirit that this Congress needs to strive to be worthy of. This is the kind of professional commitment and courage that inspires us, or should inspire us. We should not be whining around here and trying to find some error that was made somewhere where body armor did not get to a soldier. Body armor is out there protecting soldiers. It is not a problem. To say that there has never been a shortage somewhere or somehow a supply failed to get where it was supposed to, I can't say; but it is not a systemic problem. But to go around and suggest to the citizens of our country that this Congress and the military is not committed to providing body armor to our soldiers is bogus and false and undermines what they are doing. It must be most confusing to our soldiers there. But I think the vote yesterday should give them confidence that most of this talk is simply politics. Most of it is just complaining and second-guessing, like is done on the floor of the Senate every day. We hear it every day on many issues and debate and criticism is passed of the strength of American Government. But I would urge my colleagues to think differently about soldiers in conflict, soldiers in harm's way. We need to be careful what we are saying here. It may sound good, it may hurt President Bush, to make this allegation or that allegation, but is it perhaps creating in the eyes of our enemies a belief that we are divided, that we won't stay the course, and that if they just kill enough people, civilians, Americans, Iraqis, that somehow, it will all just fail. Is that the possibility that we are creating? That is why I urge my colleagues to be very careful and watch what you say in terms of attacks on the efforts that our military have so courageously undertaken in Iraq. Things happen in war. Bad things happen. But no military has done a better job of striving for perfection than ours has. I would also like to respond to charges that this Nation is going to be embarrassed historically because we have tortured people that were captured in this war on terrorism. We talked about Lincoln. Lincoln eliminated the writ of habeas corpus. Roosevelt, as Senator Durbin said, locked people up, Japanese Americans, in a way that was not justified.

This is particularly true of the native American population that calls South Dakota home. Indian people have blazed their way into American history in countless ways. Even their names convey poetry and magic: from great leaders like Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, and Black Elk, to modern day role models like Billy Mills and Jim Thorpe. White Eagle--Wanblee Ska--was a Rosebud Sioux who soared on the wings of classical music. Last week, at his parents' home in Mission, SD, White Eagle died at the age of 43. In spite of his untimely death, he left a legacy that will live on for generations. In a State where country/western music is heard on most radios, White Eagle turned his natural gift for song into a polished operatic tenor talent. He sang for the inauguration of a President and at Carnegie Hall. Despite his relative youth, he had already been enshrined in the South Dakota Hall of Fame at the time of his death. Dennis Holub, director of the South Dakota Arts Council, says that White Eagle was ``the epitome of a great artist * * * [he] sang in some of the world's finest halls but also brought his songs home so South Dakotans could enjoy them, too.'' But it was not only his gift of song that made White Eagle rise on currents of critical and public acclaim. It was his courage in overcoming obstacles and misfortune, his ability to make himself continually better while remaining utterly human, that made him an inspiration to the people of South Dakota. Although he began singing as a child and achieved some success as a church soloist and musical performer, he stopped singing after developing nodes on his vocal cords. Nevertheless, when he was subsequently asked by a friend to help out the Mile High Opera Workshop after the company lost its tenor, it became clear that White Eagle had found his true vocation. His 30th birthday was already behind him when he began voice lessons. He continued his studies and graduated from the San Francisco Opera's Merola Opera Program. He went on to work in New York City, and with the Pennsylvania Opera Theater, the Cleveland Opera, and others. White Eagle developed AIDS in the late 1980's. In a State where AIDS is even rarer than classical concerts, he became the human face of the disease. He could have hidden; instead, he became a powerful force for understanding and compassion. White Eagle overcame many obstacles in his tragically short life. He succeeded, but fate decreed he would not have enough time to fully savor his success. Nor did we have enough time to enjoy his gift. But White Eagle left an enduring legacy. Many who otherwise might not have been exposed to classical music became devotees because of White Eagle's gift. Many who might never have seen the human face of AIDS gained understanding through his courage and dignity. My connection to White Eagle stems not only from my love of his music, but also from the fact that his brother, Robert Moore, is a former member of my Washington staff. I know I speak for my office, and all of South Dakota, as I offer our condolences and prayers of support for his family in this difficult time. We join them in mourning the untimely death of White Eagle. But, even as we mourn, we celebrate his life and his gift of music, and we remember his courage and compassion. White Eagle will be missed, but he will not be forgotten, for the spirit of his gifts will endure for generations to come.","word.count":614,"sep11":-6.32303370786517,"years":1995.53651685393,"days":191,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.854901915543068,"Topic 2":0.0505810498077898,"Topic 3":0.00994401702330274,"Topic 4":0.0233678689343686,"Topic 5":0.0104626879195712,"Topic 6":0.0101512303739248,"Topic 7":0.00820325027376509,"Topic 8":0.0172309492340984,"Topic 9":0.0107074974169159,"Topic 10":0.00444953347319535},{"id":"10519980037830","body":"John 'Jimmy' Duncan: Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 314. I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding me this time. This legislation is now called the Federal Activities Inventory Reform Act. It is, I think, a bipartisan and I believe a very noncontroversial bill. In fact, the administration issued a statement on Friday saying, quote, this bill is consistent with administration efforts to reform Federal procurement and ensure that the taxpayers receive the best value. This bill was introduced by my good friend Senator Thomas in the Senate, and I introduced the companion, H.R. 716, which was cosponsored by 69 Members of this body. The legislation passed in the Senate unanimously. It passed by unanimous consent. I want to thank the gentleman from Texas for his very hard work on this legislation and the positive contributions he has made and also the contributions by the gentleman from California , the chairman. S. 314 is supported, Mr. Speaker, by the Administration and by over 100 organizations, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Independent Business, the Small Business Legislative Council and many, many others. This legislation will help eliminate some government competition with small businesses. When the last White House Conference on Small Businesses met, it listed government competition as one of its very top concerns. S. 314 will address this problem. It requires that each Federal agency annually compile a list of commercial activities currently being performed by Federal employees and to submit this list to the Office of Management and Budget. It then gives Federal agencies the authority to contract out to private sector sources the commercial activities which are currently performed by Federal employees. This bill would not require the Federal Government to contract out everything. Let me repeat that, Mr. Speaker. It would not require or force the Federal Government to contract everything out, or anything, really. Only when the private sector can show it can provide a good or service more cost effectively and efficiently would a function be contracted out. This will ensure that the taxpayers receive the very best service from their government at the lowest possible cost. For many years the Federal Government has been providing commercial goods and services which are available in the private sector. This is not a new problem. In fact, since the Eisenhower administration in 1955, it has been U.S. policy that ``the Federal Government will not start or carry on any commercial activity to provide a service or product for its own use if such product or service can be procured from private enterprise through ordinary business channels.'' I think every administration since the Eisenhower administration has agreed with or issued statements similar to that issued in 1955 by the Eisenhower administration. Yet every day in almost every congressional district, big government agencies are competing with small businesses. It is difficult enough for small businesses to survive against ordinary competition. But when they have to take on the Federal Government, too, it is simply too much. In 1987, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that 1.4 million Federal employees were engaged in so-called commercial activities. The Heritage Foundation has estimated that if we contracted out these commercial activities to private industry, we could save taxpayers at least $9 billion a year. I have seen other estimates that this legislation could result in saving as much as $40 billion a year. This bill will require that Federal agencies get out of private industry and stick to performing those functions that only government can do well. At the same time it will allow our great private enterprise system to do those things it does best, providing commercial goods and services in a competitive environment. S. 314 is a very modest proposal. It does not require the government to contract everything out. I realize that the government performs a number of functions that only the government should do. In fact, this legislation specifically exempts those functions which are inherently governmental in nature. If the government can do something cheaper and better than the private sector, then it will be allowed to continue to do it under this legislation. This is a small step, Mr. Speaker, in the overall big picture. However, this legislation will be a significant step in helping our small businesses to survive.

Wade. In those days, the idea of killing a baby in the womb because it was inconvenient would not even occur to the average individual. Elective abortion on demand, taxpayer funded abortions, no way. Certainly never in my wildest dreams would I have thought that one day I would be standing on the floor of the United States House of Representatives arguing against a practice in which a defenseless little baby, partially delivered, and moments before taking its first breath outside the womb, would be stabbed in the skull by an abortionist who would then extract the baby's brains, causing the skull to collapse, killing the powerless child. Sadly, that is how far we have come in the last three decades, or should I say that is how far we have fallen. The American Medical Association says about partial-birth abortion, it is ``not good medicine'' and ``it is not medically indicated in any situation.'' We often hear from Members of this body talking about helping the little guy, looking out for the little guy. Well, I would say to my colleagues on the left, this is their chance to look out for truly the little guy and the, oh, so little girls, the helpless, the defenseless, the powerless, the most vulnerable of all of us. This is their chance to finally put a stop to such senseless assaults on those who cannot defend themselves. Mr. Speaker, those of us who support this legislation hold little hope that our President will see the light. He has made his pact with the extremists in the abortion industry and their vocal accomplices. But we cannot ever concede this issue. We can never surrender. Let us have a powerful show of support for this legislation. Let us send a passionate message to the President that there is no place in a civilized society for the barbaric practice of partial-birth abortion. Let us cast an overwhelming vote in favor of innocent human life.","word.count":339,"sep11":-1.47191011235955,"years":2000.38764044944,"days":1918,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.00916509797507515,"Topic 2":0.203424537560941,"Topic 3":0.278989724393831,"Topic 4":0.0321282594606926,"Topic 5":0.0572022612734621,"Topic 6":0.413032588967937,"Topic 7":0.00144576212900942,"Topic 8":0.00253496952433214,"Topic 9":0.0012654980613778,"Topic 10":0.000811300653342742},{"id":"10519980086903","body":"Conrad Burns: Mr. President, if my friend from Indiana and my friend from Connecticut will yield, I am not going to oppose this amendment.

The only thing that we can do, and I think both of them have done this very well, is to raise the awareness of the need for adult supervision whenever young people go on the Internet. That is the only way. That is the only way we are going to get protection and also a public awareness and a public feeling that we are not going to do business with Internet providers who offer this stuff. We cannot protect and use this great tool called the glass highway and bring any integrity to it unless, No. 1, we secure it when I send a message to you. Of course, that is the encryption issue, and that is an issue we have to fight another day, as far as law enforcement surveillance and this type of thing is concerned.

We will never solve that problem. The only place it will be solved is through parents and us talking about it and raising the awareness that it is there. Parental supervision, supervision in our schools and our libraries, that is the only way we defeat this. Because basically we are decent people, that is what will defeat it. That is what will finally crowd it off of there, and also secure it, so maybe there will not be any room for it. I hope that would be the case, also. I congratulate the Senator from Indiana.

Lynch: Thank you, Chairman Davis, for yielding me this time Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5528 will designate the United States Postal Service facility located at 120 Commercial Street in the city of Brockton, Massachusetts, as the ``Rocky Marciano Post Office Building.'' At the outset, I would like to thank the members of the Marciano family and the public officials and the residents in the city of Brockton for their dedication in honoring Rocky Marciano, who was a remarkable champion and citizen, through the naming of this Commercial Street post office. In particular, I would like to note the contributions made by Rocky Marciano's younger brother, Peter Marciano, Sr., also Brockton Mayor Jim Harrington, my good friend, his staff assistant, Donna Daily, Senator Bob Creedon, Representative Tom Kennedy, Chris Canavan and Gerry Creedon, as well as the city council, led by City Councilman Mike Brady. In addition, I would like to note the support of the Brockton High School's legendary football coach, Armond Columbo; Brockton resident Mark Casieri, who owns Rocky Marciano's boyhood home on Dover Street; Goody Petronelli, the iconic fight trainer and owner of downtown Brockton's renowned Petronelli Brothers Gym; and last but not least, Charlie Tartaglia, who is the owner of the historic George's Cafe on Belmont Street and whose walls and whose institution there serves as a pictorial shrine to the sport of boxing and also to the life of Rocky Marciano and the city of Brockton. Mr. Speaker, Rocco Francis Marchegiano, better known as Rocky Marciano, was born and raised in a working class family in the city of Brockton, Massachusetts. He attended Brockton High School, and from his induction in 1943 to his discharge in 1946, he served this country proudly as a United States Army private with the 150th Combat Engineers. It was during his Army service that Rocky Marciano first discovered his love for boxing. And as noted in Mr. Marciano's official biography, ``There were those who didn't think much would become of the 190 pound heavyweight from Brockton in the early days.'' Nevertheless, during his subsequent professional heavyweight boxing career, Rocky Marciano, nicknamed the ``Brockton Blockbuster,'' amassed a professional record of 49 wins, no draws, and no losses, with 43 knockouts. Rocky Marciano held boxing's heavyweight title from 1952 until 1956, and, notably, he remains the only heavyweight champion in boxing history to retire undefeated. However, Rocky Marciano's legacy extends beyond the boxing ring. His achievements, his skill, and relentless work ethic and determination made Rocky Marciano the personification of what is best and proudest in the city of Brockton and in this country. As noted by sportswriter Ed Fitzgerald in a January, 1953, SPORT magazine article, ``All Brockton came to love him and always will . . . He put the city on the map; he gave its citizens a new interest in life.'' In his honor Brockton is commonly referred to as the ``City of Champions,'' and in his footsteps, the city has borne other great champions, including former boxing middleweight champion Marvin Hagler and also the celebrated Brockton High School Boxers football team, who won back-to-back State championships in 2004 and 2005. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman Davis and his subcommittee staff, as well as Denise Wilson of the full committee, for their assistance with this bill. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 5528.","word.count":560,"sep11":6.78651685393258,"years":2008.64606741573,"days":4858,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.815330038665552,"Topic 2":0.0382065835468127,"Topic 3":0.0268384079647033,"Topic 4":0.0246536662077922,"Topic 5":0.0144055787272511,"Topic 6":0.014379111003355,"Topic 7":0.0103844405217349,"Topic 8":0.0278990175951549,"Topic 9":0.022830472921666,"Topic 10":0.00507268284597747},{"id":"10519970017054","body":"Steve Buyer: Mr. Speaker, recent nuclear tests abroad serve as a stark reminder to those who need reminding that the world is still a very dangerous place.

Mr. Chairman, the Jackson-Lee substitute is an add-on. There are no offsets. It adds on $81.5 million to make the personnel account whole. They do not look at reordering priorities. They do not look at keeping the total appropriation or total authorization for NASA the same. They just want to spend some more money and not offset any of the accounts, even those that they think have been set at too high a level by the majority on the committee. The Weldon amendment, as amended by my amendment, provides the same amount of money for the NASA personnel account as the Jackson-Lee amendment, $81.5 million to stop all of those terrible things that the gentlewoman from Texas and the gentleman from California say will happen. But what the Weldon and Sensenbrenner amendments do is to offset other parts of NASA, so that our amendment is budget neutral. It does not increase the total amount of money that will be spent on NASA. It is budget neutral. So, Mr. Chairman, if Members are for just plussing up the NASA account without making offsets, vote for the Jackson-Lee amendment.

Let me now turn to the second issue, that of making sure this legislation is fully paid for within the six year period for which programs are authorized in the highway bill. During Finance Committee consideration of the tax title of the SAFETEA bill, I was joined by the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Nickles, in insisting that the bill should be properly paid for over 6 years with no gimmicks. We filed an amendment to accomplish this, but I agreed to withhold from offering it in return for a commitment from the chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee to work with me to find appropriate offsets before the SAFETEA bill was voted off the Senate floor. During floor consideration of the SAFETEA bill, I filed an amendment that would have fulfilled the commitment made to committee members during the Finance markup. Chairman Grassley and Senator Baucus worked with me to include my amendment in a managers' amendment. Unfortunately, because some items in my amendment were nongermane, only a portion of the amendment was ultimately accepted as part of the managers' amendment before the Senate voted on final passage of the SAFETEA bill. It would be my preference to address that issue in the unanimous consent agreement that will be offered shortly, but I understand that is not possible at this time. However, it is my understanding that there will be another opportunity to fulfill the commitment to fully offset spending in the Senate's highway bill before it is sent to the House for consideration. As the bill now stands, approximately $7.6 billion of spending over the next 6 years in the SAFETEA bill is not offset. I believe it is critical that this commitment be honored and that the remaining $7.6 billion in outlays be offset within the next 6 years. I am eager to continue working with the chairmen and ranking members of both the Finance and Environment and Public Works Committees to address my concerns.","word.count":360,"sep11":2.52247191011236,"years":2004.38202247191,"days":3340,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.13051614867876,"Topic 2":0.263406540285586,"Topic 3":0.014686501986813,"Topic 4":0.163477234387539,"Topic 5":0.0247706061227963,"Topic 6":0.162655087304205,"Topic 7":0.0169044215831352,"Topic 8":0.0668675520219193,"Topic 9":0.0920659566823116,"Topic 10":0.0646499509469342},{"id":"10619990001738","body":"Speaker: Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5, to repeal the Social Security earnings test.

What I keep wondering and hoping to hear, though, is how we are going to reduce the outgo. This town is not known for cutting spending, but that is the number one problem in this town is the appropriations, not the taxation. Mr. Speaker, even during an economic slowdown, our Nation still has one of the most vibrant economies in the world. We have the highest GDP of any Nation and the engine of this economy is small and medium-sized family-owned businesses. These businesses employ more than half of the workers in this country, generate more than 50 percent of the GDP and are responsible for more than 30 percent of our exports. These small and medium-sized businesses are the driving force of America's economic power. Yet throughout our excessive and complex tax system, we place every conceivable obstacle in their path toward success. In many cases, despite the best efforts of our government to hinder these economic drivers, they somehow manage through sweat, blood, tears and grit to succeed. However, there is a troubling statistic about these businesses, Mr. Speaker. Less than one-third of them survive after they are inherited by the second generation, and less than 15 percent make it into the third generation. Mr. Speaker, can you guess the number one reason for the failure of these businesses? It is lack of capital. You can further guess that the main controlling factor that leads to the lack of capital is the death tax. Mr. Speaker, most of the wealth in this Nation has been generated since World War II. Between now and the year 2040, it is estimated that American family-owned businesses will transfer more than $10 trillion of assets to their heirs. It was a wise decision for the President and this Congress to repeal this horrendous tax burden. The only problem with the repeal is that it will sunset in the year 2011. This makes it impossible for businesses to plan for the transition of ownership from one family member to another. In order for the temporary repeal to be effective, the owner would have to die in the year 2010. As a small businessman for 39 years, I have seen some pretty good business plans. But I have never seen one that had a vision in it that the owner must die at a certain time and date. I urge my colleagues to support this measure and support the small and medium-sized businesses for which this Nation is the envy of by the rest of the industrialized world.","word.count":470,"sep11":0.752808988764045,"years":2002.61235955056,"days":2710,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.183481672516881,"Topic 2":0.331638839105385,"Topic 3":0.00628825766447083,"Topic 4":0.00537388242521418,"Topic 5":0.15027647397736,"Topic 6":0.260887284971406,"Topic 7":0.00564155347508426,"Topic 8":0.0465509072292694,"Topic 9":0.00546738924756321,"Topic 10":0.00439373938736634},{"id":"10519980023183","body":"David Obey: Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman, my friend from Arizona earlier described this amendment as ``big spending at its worst.'' This amendment adds a couple of million dollars to the Federal Elections Commission budget for the purpose of increasing their capacity to protect the integrity of what is left of our campaign finance laws. I would suggest that that is not quite the case. I think big spending at its worst is the rampant cancerous use of soft money to obliterate intelligent debate in political campaigns. I think the big spending at its worst is the use of phony so-called issue advocacy ads or phony independent expenditures, whether it be by labor or by big business or by single interest groups, to influence elections, all the while pretending that they are not involved in elections at all. I think that is what is big spending at its worst, and this money is just a tiny effort to control that big spending at its worst. I would also say that it is, at least to me, apparent what the agenda of the majority party is in this case. They have been engaged in a year-long defense of the status quo on campaign finance laws, and they have been systematically attacking the agency which is trying to preserve the integrity of what is left of the existing campaign laws. They 2 years ago term-limited the FEC so that there is no institutional memory or in the future will be no institutional memory at that body. They are now trying to make certain that the Federal Elections Commission looks more like a pussycat than a tiger, and what they want to do is make certain that they can intimidate the executive director into not antagonizing anybody in order to assure that he can be reappointed. It is clear to me that there is great resentment on the other side of the aisle because the Federal Elections Commission has the temerity to dig into the activities of the use of the Republican Party of GOPAC, which contains, in my view, some of the most socially irresponsible and, at the same time, richest people in America, to influence the economic agenda of this Congress. They are unhappy because the FEC is having the temerity to examine those linkages. It just seems to me that the choice is clear: If you want to continue the status quo, if you want to continue to have a crippled FEC, vote against the amendment.

We are joined by a broad, bipartisan group of senators in this effort. In many ways we have the best health care system in the world. But increasingly fewer and fewer Americans actually have access to it. I recently introduced a tax-credit bill that will help some of these Americans and I anticipate supporting future measures aimed at increasing access to health care services. One important area that demands our attention is the problem of access for rural Americans. More than 25 percent of our Nation's senior citizens live in areas underserved for modern health care services. At the same time, telemedicine has come of age. We have moved beyond the feasibility stage and proven that this technology can provide real benefits to people in rural and underserved regions of our country. In my own State of Vermont, nearly 70 per cent live in rural areas. This is the highest percentage rural population of any state in the nation. In Vermont, specialists in more than twenty-five disciplines from Fletcher Allen Health Care in Burlington are made readily available to patients even in the most rural areas. I want to see this level of service expand and be made available to all Americans. We in Washington have made some good faith attempts to allow for the development of telehealth technologies but we have fallen short. In an effort to restrain the expansion of these programs, the Health Care Financing Administration's interpretation of the laws and its cumbersome rules for reimbursement have all but guaranteed the demise of current programs. Federally-funded telemedicine projects exist in almost every State in the Nation. These projects have proven that cost-effective, high- quality care can be delivered using this technology. The provisions in this bill will help to ensure that this care will be continued when the federal grants end. Why is this legislation needed now? Because current HCFA regulations concerning payment are unworkable in the real world. Less than 6 percent of all telemedicine doctor-patient visits last year provided to Medicare beneficiaries would qualify for reimbursement under HCFA's current guidelines. Now that we have more experience and understand better how telemedicine can be used, it is time to enact several changes to the law so that these programs can thrive and deliver on their promise of providing cost-effective, high-quality healthcare where it is needed the most. Rural healthcare providers and patients are eager for this legislation. Norman Wright, President of the Vermont Association of Hospitals and Health Systems, recognized the potential of Fletcher Allen's telemedicine program by describing it as one that ``provides incredible opportunities for rural providers and their patients because it links them to a network with access to the region's best authorities for any given condition.'' I have indeed heard an outpouring of support from healthcare providers across my own State on this issue. Gerry Davis, Professor of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Fletcher Allen Health Care, described ``appropriate and fair third party payment for telemedicine'' as ``essential in order to move this process beyond education, and to make the service truly useful for patients in remote locations.'' Telemedicine can be used in so many ways. It can be vital to a pediatrician from a rural area with a sick baby who needs to consult with a neonatologist from a tertiary care hospital in the dead of winter and the middle of the night. It can be also be crucial for a depressed senior citizen who desperately needs mental health services available in their own rural county. And it can be much needed help for a frustrated isolated primary care provider who longs to be able to provide for access to specialty services for her patients in their own community. All of these people need our help. While the changes included in this bill are relatively minor in the context of the Medicare program, the effect will be far-reaching. This legislation will allow us to avoid arbitrarily denying access to health care for our senior citizens and persons with disabilities just because of where they live. It will allow for fair and reasonable reimbursement for services that can be delivered appropriately in this way. It will also encourage the incorporation of telehealth technology in the care plans of home health agencies, an area that has already shown great promise for the future in terms of cost-effective disease management. In summary, it will allow us to begin to release the incredible potential of telemedicine. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join us in bringing HCFA's approach to the delivery of health care into the 21st Century. Any Medicare reform must include progress on telemedicine for our Nation's rural areas.","word.count":823,"sep11":-1.39044943820225,"years":2000.4691011236,"days":1947,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.883415881866394,"Topic 2":0.0384644709378126,"Topic 3":0.00824632919568488,"Topic 4":0.0202360276149289,"Topic 5":0.00820189620334248,"Topic 6":0.00862977639420063,"Topic 7":0.00644846547129329,"Topic 8":0.0145289624041235,"Topic 9":0.00827313607153143,"Topic 10":0.00355505384068821},{"id":"10720010066679","body":"Frank Murkowski: Having had the opportunity to visit New Jersey last week, I listened intently to the comments of my good friend and must say I was very moved with the presentation made by the various mayors who saw fit to share the extent of that tragedy--not only the residents of their communities, but the tremendous burden put on these areas to address the recovery efforts associated with the reality that nearly a third of the estimated number lost were residents of the State of New Jersey.

They have been working night and day on this compromise bill. In particular, I would like to note Senator Hatfield's deputy staff director for the Appropriations Committee, Mark Van de Water. Many pundits said that this omnibus fiscal year 1997 bill was not possible. They said that the Federal Government would have to operate on a 6-month continuing resolution that uses spending formulas. But, behind the scenes, Senator Hatfield and his staff worked long and hard to develop a basis for compromise. And, for the last few weeks, we all worked around the clock to conclude the negotiations that made this bill possible. The success of this process and the reality of this bill are due, in no small part, to the efforts of our Appropriations Committee's deputy staff director, Mark Van de Water. Mark is a graduate of St. Lawrence University in New York where he studied political science and economics. He has worked on the Hill since 1986. From 1991 through 1994, he served on the committee staff as the minority clerk for the District of Columbia appropriations bill. I came to know him as the man who handled Senator Hatfield's interests in our Commerce, Justice and State appropriations bill. Specifically, he ensured that Oregon's interests were protected in such diverse areas as salmon restoration, NOAA's oceanic research, and Federal law enforcement. In January 1995, Mark became our committee's deputy staff director and J. Keith Kennedy's right hand man. Since January 1995, we have been able to count on Mark as a force of moderation and decency on the Committee. He continued to operate in his straight-forward, bipartisan fashion even in the winter and spring of 1995, when our Appropriations Committee did not. In September 1995, he worked with my staff to develop compromises and a Hatfield/Hollings amendment that allowed the Commerce, Justice, and State bill to move forward and kept the bill from being recommitted to the Committee. Mark continued to watch out for programs that were of special interest to Chairman Hatfield, like aid to the poor through the Legal Services Corporation and research of the Pacific Ocean through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Too often we overlook the career professionals who make this institution and this appropriations process work. In Mark Van de Water this institution is lucky to have an individual who carries out his job with the same professionalism and conscientiousness that typifies our chairman, Mark O. Hatfield. I, for one, would like to acknowledge and thank him for his contributions to the Appropriations Committee and the Senate.","word.count":149,"sep11":-6.67977528089888,"years":1995.1797752809,"days":64,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0368924308868901,"Topic 2":0.218529246840942,"Topic 3":0.0117658615987573,"Topic 4":0.00625664958199621,"Topic 5":0.214145233491843,"Topic 6":0.00316118940861878,"Topic 7":0.00358403687680139,"Topic 8":0.0205608435441273,"Topic 9":0.0713501875887765,"Topic 10":0.413754320181247},{"id":"11020070022621","body":"John Conyers: How do we know this land claim is bogus?

But more than 60 tribes across this country have announced their opposition to H.R. 2176, in which Congress for the first time would allow a tribe to expand its reservation into the ancestral lands of another tribe for the express purpose of gaming. This bill is opposed by the Department of the Interior, the NAACP, UNITE HERE, and a unanimous House Judiciary Committee. To sum up the issue: Congress is being asked to pass special interest legislation benefiting two tribes, each of which already has gaming, based on a suspect land claim that has already been thrown out of court, so they can open casinos hundreds of miles from their ancestral lands, in direct competition with existing facilities. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to be here today with Chairman Conyers and Congresswoman Kilpatrick to share my opposition to H.R. 2176. I believe this bill will result in an unprecedented expansion of off-reservation Indian gaming by offering a blueprint to any Indian tribe that wants to circumvent the laws regulating Indian gaming in order to build a casino outside the boundaries of its sovereign territory. As Las Vegas's representative in Congress, I do not oppose gaming. I can attest to the positive impact that gaming can have on a community. I have no problem with other communities trying to replicate the Las Vegas experience, and I support the right of tribes to participate in gaming on their reservations, as both of these tribes already do. But the bill we are considering today is an attempt to circumvent the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act using a bogus land claim that has already been tossed out of both Federal and State court, and the result if the bill passes will be two new off-reservation casinos more than 350 miles from the lands of these two tribes. And beyond that, if this bill becomes law, any one of the more than 500 recognized Native American tribes can argue that they have the right to sue private landowners in an attempt to bargain for gaming somewhere else. How do we know the land claim is bogus? In his testimony before Congress in 2002, the chairman of the Soo Saint Marie tribe called it ``shady,'' ``suspicious,'' and ``a scam.'' Soon thereafter, his tribe became a party to the deal and switched its position.

If this bill is brought to the floor, I will strongly urge my colleagues to oppose it.","word.count":158,"sep11":5.83988764044944,"years":2007.69943820225,"days":4521,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0304302705381053,"Topic 2":0.122029895496792,"Topic 3":0.0205983154765889,"Topic 4":0.00249630494839631,"Topic 5":0.728633099620875,"Topic 6":0.00536885332049504,"Topic 7":0.00221530750199375,"Topic 8":0.060264330028355,"Topic 9":0.0039209320540225,"Topic 10":0.0240426910143761},{"id":"10419950041070","body":"William F. Goodling: Mr. Speaker, one of the important accomplishments of this bill is that it focuses the FAA exclusively on safety, a matter of renewed concern in this country. The conference report includes a number of provisions similar to the Vice President's Aviation Security and Antiterrorism Commission. These include requiring airlines and airports to conduct background checks-- in some cases, criminal background checks--of all personnel who would screen passengers, baggage, or cargo; and requires the FAA to certify companies that provide security screening, and to develop uniform performance standards for the training and testing of security screeners. While these steps are welcome and needed, they should be considered a beginning. The FAA should establish performance milestones that are attached to the development of technology. They should conduct a classified review of which airports are the safest, and immediately take steps to bring other airports up to speed using the safest airports as working models. The FAA should be implementing a long-term strategy taking into consideration all of the Vice President's recommendations, including any followup report that the Commission may have in the coming months. Although the bill requires the FAA to use existing technology for explosives detection even if the technology has not been perfected, the FAA gets to decide whether such technology provides a benefit. The FAA should accept technology even of minimal benefit. Even if a device can only detect explosives or weapons 30 percent of the time, it will improve safety. In addition, Mr. Speaker, in privatizing some airports, the Congress and the FAA should consider what this will do to the uniform standards that the bill is working to implement. There is a lot of promise in new technology: in explosive detection machines to explosion-proof cargo holds. These will augment traditional procedures such as well-trained staff, bomb-sniffing dogs, x-ray devices, and others. These needs provide a clear mandate for Government-sponsored research and development of technology. All of these efforts should be looked at as milestones toward a single goal: that no airport should be less safe than another. We must achieve a single standard of high security for American airports; a standard that every airport in this country meets at the same level.","word.count":234,"sep11":-6.3061797752809,"years":1995.55337078652,"days":197,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.152681391798861,"Topic 2":0.427756607451968,"Topic 3":0.012612658106387,"Topic 4":0.0111641277643673,"Topic 5":0.224631267520142,"Topic 6":0.0174644314100239,"Topic 7":0.00861941983703061,"Topic 8":0.0586853584718568,"Topic 9":0.0449826839087771,"Topic 10":0.0414020537305866},{"id":"11020070101081","body":"Robert C. Byrd: Mr. President, as Congress reconvenes this week after our observance of the Thanksgiving holiday, we find a brisk wind blowing through the streets of the Nation's Capital. As cold temperatures begin to grip the country, Americans are turning up the heat in their homes, but the elected leaders of our country should seize the opportunity to turn down the heat in Washington. Three days ago, in his weekly radio address, the President placed the blame at the feet of Congress for the delays in enacting 11 of the 12 annual appropriations bills. But finger pointing does nothing--nothing, zilch--to solve the impasse, which began with White House threats to veto 10 of those funding bills. With 3 short weeks left in this session of Congress, it is time to close down the political posturing and recognize we have a responsibility to govern. As the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, it is clear to me that Congress is working with great diligence to find a way around our budget conundrum. Working hand in hand with Members of the minority, we are crafting an appropriations package that I expect will garner bipartisan support. This package contemplates a reduction of $10.6 billion from the spending levels approved by Congress in this year's budget resolution. And $10.6 billion is a lot of money. In addition, various controversial matters, some of which have been the subject of veto threats, are eliminated. Both Democrats and Republicans in Congress are attempting, in good faith, to find a way around the veto threat demagoguery that has been emanating from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue for months. Now the White House needs to put aside politics and recognize it is time to govern in the responsible manner that is expected by the American people. I urge the President--and he is my President, too, and I say it respectfully--to stop the stale veto threats that have been the albatross around the neck of responsible budgeting for months. The fact is the needs of this Nation have changed since the budget was submitted way back in February. That should come as no great surprise. The Senate, on a bipartisan basis, has recognized these needs, and events have made them crystal clear. The crumbling state of our infrastructure was punctuated by a deadly--and I mean deadly--bridge collapse in Minnesota. The Senate passed a bill containing funds for the bridge replacement and for repairing bridges across the Nation by a vote of 88 to 7. That was the responsible thing to do. Soaring oil prices mean a cruel squeeze on low-income heating assistance. The Senate approved by a vote of 75 to 19 a bill providing increased heating assistance. That was the responsible thing to do. Investigations into the treatment of soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan have underlined greater demands on the VA health care system. Legislation to increase funding for our veterans passed the Senate by a vote of 92 to 1. That was the moral thing to do. More money is needed to improve the security of our borders. An amendment to provide such funding passed the Senate 89 to 1. That was the smart thing to do. In July, the administration released its latest National intelligence report that concluded al-Qaida has regrouped in Pakistan with the intention of attacking the United States again. The Senate passed a Homeland Security bill to increase funding for first responders by a vote of 89 to 4. Rising crime rates in this country highlight the wisdom of additional funding for law enforcement. The Senate passed legislation providing such funding for cops on the street by a vote of 75 to 19. The rising cost of food means that there must be more funding for the Women, Infants and Children Program or 500,000 people will lose important nutritional support. Yet despite all of these developments since the President submitted an inadequate spending proposal in February, the White House continues to demand an arbitrary and irresponsible ceiling on spending. The White House continues to stubbornly oppose bipartisan initiatives to invest money to solve the real problems that face the Nation. Soon, the first session of this 110th Congress will draw to a close, but there is still time to craft an appropriations proposal that makes a sincere attempt to meet the President in the middle of the road. I thank Senator Thad Cochran and his ranking members for their efforts as we move forward in completing the fiscal year 2008 appropriations process. So the choice is clear--as clear as the noonday Sun in a cloudless sky. The President and the Congress must recognize that the people of this country expect their leaders--that is us, the people downtown at the other end of the avenue and those across the Capitol--to actually govern and address the real problems facing the country. Democrats and Republicans in Congress are willing to work to resolve differences and complete a fiscally responsible package of appropriations bills. But to do the people's business, the Congress must be joined by a White House willing, at last, to jettison its political posturing, stop its political posturing. The tyranny of the veto threat has already dangerously delayed the Nation's priorities for far too long. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.","word.count":878,"sep11":6.39044943820225,"years":2008.25,"days":4717,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.806539838012648,"Topic 2":0.0757409953350131,"Topic 3":0.0127434741526458,"Topic 4":0.0275666608810266,"Topic 5":0.0144959940087352,"Topic 6":0.0124390149486762,"Topic 7":0.0102563094271141,"Topic 8":0.0208483032478989,"Topic 9":0.0135196903771053,"Topic 10":0.00584971960913699},{"id":"10419950111285","body":"Bob Dole: Madam President, earlier this month, in homes, neighborhoods, and communities across the country, Americans celebrated our Nation's 219th birthday. There was, of course, much to celebrate. Over two centuries after the signing of the Declaration of Independence, America remains what she has always been--the beacon of freedom, and the last best hope for all mankind on Earth. But as we celebrate these freedoms, and commemorate those who have sacrificed so much along the way, we must also remember that American history is not always a tale of progress and dreams fulfilled. American history is a history of hope mixed with tragedy-- institutionalized slavery, a Constitution which said that African- Americans were only three-fifths human, Jim Crow and ``separate but equal.'' This legacy is a source of great shame for us precisely because so many of these outrages contradicted one of the founding principles of our republic--that all men are created equal and that we are all endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights, including the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Today, in the America of 1995, the evils of discrimination and racism persist. They may not be as blatant as they once were. They may not be as fashionable. But they are out there, lurking in the corners, poisoning young minds, and yes, harming real people in the process. Over the years, Americans of goodwill have tried to make a difference. We have enacted an array of antidiscrimination laws. And in the 1960's and the early 1970's, the concept of affirmative action was born, the product of a heartfelt desire to rectify past injustices and expand opportunity for all Americans. Many Republicans, acting with the best of intentions, were directly involved in this effort. I, for one, not only supported the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, but have also endorsed certain race- and gender- conscious steps to remedy the lingering effects of historic discrimination. That is my record, and I am proud of it. Few of us, however, believed that these policies would become a seemingly permanent fixture of our society, but that is exactly what they have become today. During the past 30 years, we have seen the policies of preference grow and grow and grow some more, pitting American against American, group against group, in a bitter competition for a piece of the Government pie. Somehow, somewhere along the way, fighting discrimination has become an easy excuse to abandon the color-blind ideal. Too often today, the laudable goal of expanding opportunity is used by the Federal Government to justify dividing Americans. That is wrong, and it ought to stop. You do not cure the evil of discrimination with more discrimination. President Clinton had the opportunity today to stand up for principle by stating--in the clearest possible terms--that it is wrong for the Federal Government to discriminate against its citizens on the basis of race, color, ethnic background, or gender. Without hesitation or ambiguity, he could have said ``yes'' to individual rights, and ``no'' to group rights; ``yes'' to the principle of equal opportunity and ``no'' to the perversion of this principle with the divisive policies of preference. Instead of clarity--and I have just finished listening to the President--the President has chosen confusion. He has chosen to complicate an uncomplicated issue with an avalanche of words and fine distinctions. This is not a difficult issue: discrimination is wrong, and preferential treatment is wrong, too. Our Government in Washington should unite the American people, not divide us. It should guarantee equal opportunity, not divide Americans through the use of quotas, set- asides, numerical objectives, and other preferences. And that is why I will introduce legislation next week designed to get the Federal Government out of the group preference business. The President says he is against quotas. Quotas are only a small part of the entire regime of preferences. It is not enough to oppose ``quotas,'' as if the label is what might be offensive. It is the practice of dividing Americans through any form of preferential treatment that is objectionable. The President also denounces preferences for ``unqualified''-- ``unqualified'' individuals, when the real issue here is not preferences for the unqualified, which virtually every American opposes--why have preferences for the unqualified?--but preferences for the ``less qualified'' over those who are ``more qualified.'' That is the debate. This distinction is critical. But it is one that the President conveniently ignores. Madam President, leadership is about making the tough choices. It is about staking out a clear and crisp principle and holding firm to it. And, yes, leadership can sometimes mean putting a little distance between yourself and your political allies. Regrettably, the President is trying to have it both ways. Madam President, 2 years ago, I convened a meeting in my office with a distinguished group of African-American leaders with the goal of developing a civil rights agenda for the 1990's, one that is relevant for the needs and challenges of our time. A relevant civil rights agenda means enforcing the antidiscrimination laws that are already on the books--enforcing the antidiscrimination laws that are already [[Page S 10261]] on the books. It means removing regulatory barriers to economic opportunity--something we are in the throes of trying to do right now on the Senate floor--including the discriminatory Davis-Bacon Act. It means school choice for low-income, inner-city people and means meaningful welfare reform that will transform lives from ones of dependence to ones of independence. And it means making our streets safer and renewing the war on drugs. After all, our first civil right is freedom from the fear of crime. This is the real civil rights agenda of our time. Not preferences, not set-asides, not quotas, but the dreams that are built on real opportunity. Madam President, I would hope when I introduce my bill it will become at least a focus of dialog because I know different people have different views. But none of us believes that discrimination is appropriate. It is wrong. It has always been wrong. It should be punished. And I think that is what this debate is all about.","word.count":1024,"sep11":-6.30898876404494,"years":1995.55056179775,"days":196,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.214217294016616,"Topic 2":0.558413442207646,"Topic 3":0.00926831548884377,"Topic 4":0.0757507106576148,"Topic 5":0.10506915743556,"Topic 6":0.0045283162660479,"Topic 7":0.0045735742915267,"Topic 8":0.0111329098100642,"Topic 9":0.0109553531689434,"Topic 10":0.00609092665713817},{"id":"10720010048127","body":"James Inhofe: Mr. President, we cannot very well have it both ways.

Mr. Speaker, I want to just disagree with my good friend from Massachusetts on his characterization of the accomplishments of this Congress. As a matter of fact, if you start ticking off the record, it is pretty impressive: bankruptcy reform, class action lawsuit reform, a transportation bill that put more money into our infrastructure than any transportation bill in American history, significant energy legislation passed last year, dealing with the entitlement spending problem, an across-the-board budget cut. All of those are genuine accomplishments. Pension reform, bill after bill after bill. Some of them bipartisan, some of them, frankly, passed without the cooperation of our friends. And, frankly, to criticize us for minimum wage, when in this House we have voted on and passed the minimum wage increase and passed, along with it, a reform of the death tax and tax extender bills that are important, I think is somewhat disingenuous. That legislation passed with a majority vote on this floor; and, frankly, a majority of the other body favored that legislation. Our friends on the other side of the aisle used their friends on the other side of the rotunda to routinely block progress. Even when the majority of the United States Senate agrees with the will of this House, as was the case with the minimum wage, with ANWR, and another piece of legislation with the tax extenders, with reform of the death tax, an obstructionist minority of Democrats on the other side keep a bipartisan majority from actually reaching the magic 60 vote level that is required in moving legislation forward. We are not responsible for that. Frankly, I am proud of what we have moved through the floor here. I also want to disagree with my good friend on the Medicare measure that he discussed in his remarks. Quite frankly, it is something that I think our good friends on the other side of the aisle are embarrassed that they did not support. It was the largest expansion of spending for senior citizens and entitlement spending since 1965. Since 1965. Now the argument that the Democrats advanced that night, and I was here, was it is not enough. They were not willing to vote for something that was the largest increase in almost 40 years. It simply was not enough. And I think now that tens of thousands of seniors are getting health care that in the past they were not able to get, and that our friends on the other side had nothing to do with that accomplishment puts them in the position where they feel like they have to take away from the achievement that they could have been part of but rejected the opportunity to participate in. Finally, let me just conclude my observation that there are only two times when we get criticized from the other side of the aisle. That is when we do something and when we do not. Day after day, and particularly morning after morning this week, we have heard demands from the floor or from the well of this body on the floor that we have up or down votes on issue after issue after issue. Now when we are bringing important issues for up or down votes, issues that in many cases have been dealt with for months through the committee process, we are dealing with conference reports or providing an up or down opportunity, we are criticized for that. So I suspect we are going to be criticized regardless of what we do. What I am pleased with is the record of accomplishment that this Congress has to offer to the American people in issue after issue. My only regret is that, frankly, our friends on the other side of the aisle have so often chosen to obstruct rather than participate, in my opinion, constructively in this process. I hope that that changes ahead. Frankly, there have been times when it has been different on this floor. I would hold the pension reform bill out as an example of that. I would also point out on things like the PATRIOT Act, where we had 40 odd of our friends from the other side participating; tort reform, where 70 odd of our friends participated on the other side; there have been many instances of bipartisan reform cooperation. Unfortunately, in my opinion, it has diminished as we have moved forward in the Congress and moved closer to November. I hope on the other side of November that will change. But I, for one, am very proud of this Congress and what it has accomplished; and I look forward to working with our friends on the other side of the aisle so we can accomplish more in the months that remain in this Congress and, frankly, in the next one. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.","word.count":270,"sep11":4.23314606741573,"years":2006.09269662921,"days":3949,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.169640156993653,"Topic 2":0.297738285638515,"Topic 3":0.0375669207313594,"Topic 4":0.0159399175206128,"Topic 5":0.30556568779273,"Topic 6":0.0965385918082988,"Topic 7":0.0265944158556114,"Topic 8":0.0220487725638137,"Topic 9":0.0218786205763155,"Topic 10":0.00648863051909011},{"id":"11020080050278","body":"Daniel K. Akaka: Mr. President, today I proudly introduce, along with my good friend and colleague, the senior Senator from Hawaii, Senator Daniel Inouye, the Native American Veterans Access Act. This measure would provide equitable veterans' services to Native Americans by allowing tribal governments to apply for veterans' program grants currently limited to States, and in some cases, even U.S. Territories. Native veterans have a long history of honorable and extraordinary service in our national defense. From the American Indians who served alongside General George Washington, to Nainoa Hoe, a Native Hawaiian soldier who was killed on patrol in Iraq while carrying the battle flag his father held in Vietnam, native veterans have served bravely and honorably. Unfortunately, too often our Nation's track record in serving native veterans does not match their service. Especially in the case of native veterans who return to their ancestral homelands, reservation communities, or tribal villages, many native veterans are geographically and culturally disconnected from the services provided by State and Federal veterans' programs. Part of the problem is that veterans' programs are not always designed with native veterans in mind. For example, while the Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Labor operate several exemplary veterans' grant programs for State governments, most of these programs are not open to tribal governments. The bill I am introducing today would address this issue, by giving tribal governments access to many of these important programs. First, my bill would provide access to VA's two nursing home grants, which help local governments construct veterans' nursing homes and pay for nursing home care, adult day care, domiciliary care, and hospital care. It is important that tribal governments be included in these grants, given the expected rise in the number of older native veterans. The U.S. Census projects that while the overall number of older veterans will decrease by 10 percent by 2020, during that same period the number of older native veterans will increase by 60 percent. This expected boom in older native veterans makes it important that we give tribal governments the same opportunities we already provide State governments to care for their elder veterans. My bill would also give the Secretary of Labor discretion to include tribal governments in Veterans Employment and Training programs and grants. Veterans' employment services are much needed among native veterans, and in Indian Country. Census data indicates that American Indian and Alaska Native veterans are twice as likely as other veterans to be unemployed. For those veterans living on-reservation, the labor market is shamefully dismal: a recently published report from the Bureau of Indian Affairs found on-reservation unemployment to be 49 percent. That unemployment rate is twice as high as national unemployment was during the worst year of the Great Depression. Surely it is not too much to ask that tribal governments in these circumstances be considered for the veterans' employment programs States and U.S. Territories already have access to. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting these measures, as we work towards parity in access and benefits for Native American veterans. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the the Record. There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be placed in the Recrod, as follows: ``8133A. Tribal organizations.''.","word.count":549,"sep11":6.82865168539326,"years":2008.68820224719,"days":4873,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.0291594126351226,"Topic 2":0.0226694928713448,"Topic 3":0.847212415414943,"Topic 4":0.0258112718215851,"Topic 5":0.012131754478252,"Topic 6":0.00917210783463869,"Topic 7":0.00320494035809944,"Topic 8":0.0410821019357706,"Topic 9":0.00496167969096033,"Topic 10":0.00459482295928317},{"id":"11020080025748","body":"Robert E.

I wanted to use my time today to say that I stand in strong support of H.R. 5959 because I think this edition of the intelligence authorization bill does the same thing, and that is it forces the agencies to be more efficient, it forces them to work together, and at the same time it is providing our men and women around this world the resources that they need to do an even better job of protecting us. I am particularly concerned about our access to space. It is in the national interest of the United States to have domestic capability for assured access to space. So as this bill proceeds forward, I hope we will make sure that while we are performing oversight and we are forcing the agencies to become more efficient, to consolidate what they do, that we don't throw the baby out with the bath water.

After graduating in 1939 from Yale College, Mr. Walker enlisted in the Marine Corps, was commissioned a second lieutenant in 1941 and was deployed to the South Pacific during World War II. As a Raider Company commander, he led part of the successful attack on Viru Harbor, New Georgia. He was wounded in New Georgia at the battle for Bairoko. Returning to combat, he fought in the campaigns of Emirau, Guam, and Okinawa. In Okinawa, he commanded the 6th Marine Division's Reconnaissance Company, leading numerous night patrols and attacks. The end of the war marked 30 continuous months for him in the Pacific Theater. Colonel Walker later served tours of duty as a U.N. observer in Kashmir, as a battalion and regimental commander in the Fleet Marine Force, as a commander of Marine Barracks at Fort Campbell, KY, and at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. He was a student and an instructor at the U.S. Naval War College in Newport, and in 1971 concluded 32 years of active duty, including a year in South Vietnam as the Operations Officer of the Joint Military Assistance Command. In the Marine Corps, this Vietnam War veteran was known as ``Cold Steel'' in recognition of his particular skill in close combat and small unit tactics. Colonel Walker was highly regarded for his tactical and leadership skills. His decorations included two Silver Stars, the Purple Heart, a Presidential Unit Citation, a Navy Unit Commendation and the Legion of Merit. A devoted military historian, he published two books and numerous articles, many on the Revolutionary War. His book, ``So Few the Brave,'' is the definitive history of the Rhode Island regiments in the Revolution. Colonel Walker served as president of Middletown Little League and was a volunteer for the Sachuest Point Wildlife Sanctuary.

Because I agree with him, they are not going to find anybody liable. But what they would do, by continuing having this out in open hearing, is to disclose the most secretive methods and procedures used by our intelligence community, giving the terrorists and those who seek to do us harm a roadmap for getting around it and avoiding those intercepts. Now, what it would also do is expose those companies to tremendous public scorn and possibly even to injury to their property or to their personnel. Where they operate overseas, they might be attacked. When we started this debate, my colleague, the senior Senator from Illinois, was talking about how an unwarranted disclosure of a question about one of the vitally important exchanges operating in Chicago had cost billions of dollars to that exchange. When you leak out something that is classified, when you leak out something that is secret, you can have a tremendous impact, and every shareholder of that exchange and every shareholder, whether it be in your pension fund or anyone else, of one of the carriers that might be drawn out and drawn into court in one of these actions, would lose significantly. Now, to answer the question put specifically by the Senator from Pennsylvania, the cases against the Government are not blocked. The cases against the Government are not blocked. If we are looking for a means of determining the constitutionality, which I believe exists--he obviously doesn't believe exists. OK, we have a disagreement. He is a learned lawyer, and I studied constitutional law a long time ago. We have different views. I can line up a bunch of constitutional law professors on my side. I am sure he can do the same. But that court can go forward because a suit really is a suit against the government. I think he is right when he is saying he doesn't want to hurt the companies. I don't believe any significant number of Members of this body want to hurt the employees or their shareholders of the companies that may have participated because they were true American heroes. But if he wants to solve the problem that he has--getting court review-- then there is no bar in this legislation to a suit against the Government, a Government officer, or a Government agent.","word.count":442,"sep11":7,"years":2008.8595505618,"days":4934,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.191640401728995,"Topic 2":0.0850115355306931,"Topic 3":0.0157531894335221,"Topic 4":0.211194619922115,"Topic 5":0.00689502919861326,"Topic 6":0.00586689642945145,"Topic 7":0.00611408018950993,"Topic 8":0.189715941534906,"Topic 9":0.279221856075955,"Topic 10":0.00858644995623924},{"id":"11020070089601","body":"Orrin G.

I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting this resolution and in wishing the members of the ULCT another 100 years of success in the century to come.","word.count":148,"sep11":6.04213483146067,"years":2007.90168539326,"days":4593,"party":"Republican","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.240778064002667,"Topic 2":0.231530084366339,"Topic 3":0.0178980933234664,"Topic 4":0.014505774929112,"Topic 5":0.284182766749816,"Topic 6":0.0144540377999832,"Topic 7":0.035900267334858,"Topic 8":0.0662984813869702,"Topic 9":0.0824162381858382,"Topic 10":0.0120361919209496},{"id":"10619990034105","body":"Ron Lewis: Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 minutes.","word.count":175,"sep11":-2.00280898876404,"years":1999.85674157303,"days":1729,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.169072907278521,"Topic 2":0.373176637530123,"Topic 3":0.00740879270273968,"Topic 4":0.190603230815836,"Topic 5":0.040281069430918,"Topic 6":0.00374174569929093,"Topic 7":0.0886367542207131,"Topic 8":0.0109154585493333,"Topic 9":0.107514243952258,"Topic 10":0.0086491598202679},{"id":"10419960030327","body":"Marcy Kaptur: Mr. Chairman, our amendment simply states that no funds made available to the United States Customs Service may be used to allow the importation of Chinese goods into the United States that were made with the use of prison, slave or child labor. Now, under a previous memorandum of understanding signed in August 1992 between the United States and the People's Republic of China along with the statement of cooperation signed then 2 years later in 1994, the United States Customs Department is already directed to monitor and ban the importation of such goods, but we know that there is convincing evidence that the United States Customs Service has not been doing so and not following the law. Now, this amendment is very important because it reiterates the commitment of this Congress not to allow the importation into this marketplace of goods made with child, prison, or slave labor. We know that in China 5 to 50 million children are currently working under slave labor conditions in horrendous sweatshops. We also know that 80 to 90 percent of convicts in China are placed in forced labor conditions in Laogai prison camps in the name of reeducation through labor, and there are plenty of publications available that describe what happens. In fact, some of our Members on both sides of the aisle have gone into these camps, even returning here at home with those gum shoes and other products that are sold into this marketplace which should not even be allowed over our borders. We know the latest Amnesty International report on China redocuments the fact that the government treats its own people with contempt, and in regard to prison labor we know that the Chinese Government and prison authorities have knowingly, knowingly sought to evade China's commitment to the two agreements we as a Nation signed with them. In fact, in our own State Department's 1995 country report on human rights practices it is stated, and I quote directly: Now, under our laws the United States Customs Department is already directed to monitor and enforce the prohibition of Chinese goods made under those specific conditions. There may be some questions with the reservation that was asked for, but I hope will be suspended when this is complete, that any impact on funds directed to the U.S. Customs Department and subsequent revenue collection activities would only be impacted under this amendment if there is evidence that Chinese goods made under these conditions are still being allowed into our marketplace. At present there is ostensibly no tariff revenue collected on Chinese goods made under these conditions because ostensibly the United States Customs Department should be complying with United States law. Now, let me add there are other points here, other egregious examples of where our United States-China trade relationship is off on the wrong foot and really fails to protect our national interests, and these are so compelling and so indisputable and so vital to address I wish there were a way to do it under this measure. But we are narrowly focusing our attention on just those goods made under those three conditions that we do not want into this country. But let me mention that we have a growing trade deficit with China, this year over $40 billion a year, lost jobs in this marketplace, lost revenues to our treasury and lost business to our exporters and manufacturers partly due to the lack of reciprocity between this market and the Chinese market where, under China MFN, we give China a 2- percent tariff advantage in our marketplace. They only have to pay 2 percent for their goods come in here. Yet they charge us 40-percent tariff rates on a whole range of products which I will be submitting to the record as evidence here. And also the dual exchange rate system that they operate that truly disadvantages our exporters and acts as a $15 billion tax in the form of tariffs due to this exchange rate differential on our manufacturers exporting into that market. And I will be submitting that evidence for the record of this very lopsided trading relationship that effectively discriminates severely against U.S. interests. But in terms of this amendment there can be no question that through China's use of prison, slave, and child labor they should not be able to make goods that then find their way into this marketplace, and it is the obligation of the United States Customs Service to enforce the laws of this country.

Rangel: Mr. Speaker, first let me once again thank Mr. English for the diligent way that he addresses the problems that are before our committee. His working with Richard Neal makes me proud to be a member and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. I do hope that at some point that we will be able to get past the barrier of partisanship to deal with a national security issue, a global climate issue, an issue that should challenge all partisanship as we move forward. It defies common sense to believe that the oil industry that is receiving billions of dollars in profit would even consider the $14 billion that we are talking about. It is almost like grains of sand on the beach. We are asking them to be partners with us, not just for their shareholders, which they know how to take care of, but for their country, to be able to say that our foreign policy should not be directed by where oil is, to be able to say at the end of the day we can tell our kids and grandkids that we tried to protect the atmosphere of this great country, to be able to say that there are alternatives, that we don't have to rely on fossil fuels. We have the genius. We have the creativity. And this bill provides the incentives to see whether we can use the wind, the water, waste, solar, whatever it takes. We have the know-how given the opportunity which this bill will give to deal with it. We can create products that conserve energy. We can increase our surplus in terms of trade by being able to produce products that are far more competitive than what we are doing today. What a great opportunity for us. And when we talk about potential recession or whatever the President wants to call it, we have to recognize the big role that the increase in the price of oil has played with families who used to consider themselves middle income and now are faced with ever-increasing home fuel costs, automobile costs and all of these things, and to find that we have to give them $159 billion because they don't have the ability to put food on the table or shoes on their kids' feet or to pay their rent or to pay their mortgage. All of this, we can handle these problems if we work together in a bipartisan way. We even go as far as to say in the bill that we don't have all of the answers. We provide tax-exempt bonds for mayors and Governors and people with exciting ideas of how to make greenhouses and increase the efficiency of our commercial buildings as well as our residents. Why don't we give hope a chance and give the challenge to America a chance, force the Senate to come to meet with us and in a bipartisan way in the House to be able to say that we are prepared to do these things. And so I do hope that people would reconsider that did not support H.R. 5351. I do hope and congratulate the leadership and Nancy Pelosi, our Speaker, for never giving up and not giving in just because we face political obstacles. The record is going to indicate which side we were on, and it is abundantly clear, were you on the side of Big Oil or were you on the side of change and wanting to make certain that we met the challenges that we are forced to do.","word.count":594,"sep11":6.62921348314607,"years":2008.48876404494,"days":4802,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.557201979195182,"Topic 2":0.0936963464544193,"Topic 3":0.0396428150280136,"Topic 4":0.0249349371634024,"Topic 5":0.23868103465934,"Topic 6":0.00928597960773842,"Topic 7":0.00541287475466366,"Topic 8":0.0187124847328148,"Topic 9":0.00554877215167065,"Topic 10":0.00688277625275587},{"id":"10620000002320","body":"Roscoe Bartlett: Mr. Speaker, I would like us for a few moments to think about what raising the minimum wage means. What we are doing is telling a business that certainly they are prosperous enough to pay a dollar more an hour to their employees. This is clearly, then, an attempt on our part to mandate something, which clearly we cannot mandate; and that is prosperity. If we can mandate prosperity, then there are some other things that I would like us to mandate. How about happiness? It is just as reasonable that we can mandate happiness as we can mandate prosperity. If we can mandate prosperity and happiness, then I am particularly interested in mandating longevity. If we really can mandate prosperity, then why should we stop at a small dollar an hour increase? Why do we not make the minimum wage $10 an hour or $20 an hour. See, if we really do have the power to mandate prosperity, why should we be so miserly in the delegation of this power. Let us make it $10 an hour or $20 an hour. The minimum wage is not an issue in the district that I have the honor of representing. I see signs out at sheet stores $7.25 an hour. But I will tell my colleagues where it is important. It is important in those areas where we are cutting off the bottom rung of the economic ladder for those who need it most. Who works for minimum wage? Young people living with their parents count for 37.6 percent of those on minimum wage. 85.1 percent of all those on minimum wage either live with their parents, are single and live alone, have a working spouse, or extended family members and nonrelatives living in the home. Only 5, let me repeat this, only 5.5 percent of minimum wage earners are single parents, and only 7.8 percent are in married single-earner families where the household may or may not include children. What I want to do is to give all the payroll taxes back to head of family that is working on minimum wage. I want to give more than that. I have no problem helping the working poor. But what we cannot do is pretend that we can do something we cannot do, and that is to mandate prosperity. The marketplace determines, we cannot possibly determine the value of a job. The marketplace determines the value of a job. But I will tell my colleagues what we can do is come in after the marketplace has determined the value of a job, and then we can help, we can help so that person, that family can live a reasonable life.

On Saturday of this past week, we went into a boys and girls club in a YMCA that does computer training and tutoring after school in the evenings and even on Saturday, for that matter. I must confess, these computers have come out since I left 4 years ago. They had little computers for little tots in kindergarten where they would get at a bench, and they were telling me that in this boys and girls club as they put these children in front of these computers, they were like beginning computers, not big ones that we see but similar to the stuff they play games on, but they were math, helped them in the math, helped them in their composition.

Mr. President, today I stand to submit a resolution focused on the development of self-government in Kosovo. I am pleased that Senators Voinovich, Allen, Smith, and Biden have joined me in co- sponsoring this legislation. I believe that Kosovo's future lies in building democracy, respecting human rights, and fostering ethnic reconciliation. I am hopeful that the United States will remain involved in Kosovo until it is self- sustaining. I also believe that a successful conclusion to Kosovo's status is crucial to Balkan reintegration into Europe and into Euro- Atlanta institutions. It has been 5 years since the signing of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 that marked the end of a brutal conflict in Kosovo. Much progress has been made, but it is critical to focus on the work at hand: developing political processes that are inclusive and protect human rights, especially those of minorities. My resolution focuses on the process of getting Kosovo to achieve self-governance before its future status is determined. The United States Senate must continue to support the efforts of UNMIK and KFOR , and promote steps to foster the development of the Kosovo economy through strengthened cooperation with the South Central Europe region and Euro-Atlantic institutions. I was pleased to co-sponsor a resolution submitted by my colleague, Senator Voinovich, that condemned the ethnic violence that erupted in Kosovo last March, and that called upon the people of Kosovo to cooperate with UNMIK, KFOR and the Kosovo Police to identify and bring to justice the perpetrators of the violence. I strongly support the Administration's new policy initiative for Kosovo, which was launched last November. It foresees periodic review of progress by Kosovo's autonomous institutions of self-government on establishing rule of law, multi-ethnic democracy, market economic reform, and stable relations with neighbors. My resolution calls upon the leaders of the Provisional Institutions of Self-Governance in Kosovo, and upon the leaders of the political parties and communities of Kosovo, to renew their efforts in cooperation with UNMIK, KFOR, and the international community to achieve political and economic stability. A critical step in Kosovo's development is a stable relationship with Belgrade. I urge both sides to engage in direct dialogue. I believe that it is critical for the U.S. to continue to play a central role in Kosovo and provide strong assistance in achieving the benchmarks, and at an appropriate time, in determining a process leading to final status. I urge my colleagues to lend their support to U.S. policy in the Balkans and ask their support for this resolution.","word.count":423,"sep11":2.83988764044944,"years":2004.69943820225,"days":3453,"party":"Democratic","chamber":"S","Topic 1":0.146123363208855,"Topic 2":0.353157529553636,"Topic 3":0.040679652767215,"Topic 4":0.011052319386379,"Topic 5":0.0140087368810376,"Topic 6":0.0108098263799965,"Topic 7":0.00937731206035393,"Topic 8":0.0655328533369575,"Topic 9":0.327472386148324,"Topic 10":0.0217860202772467},{"id":"10920050032634","body":"Ray LaHood: The gentleman from Kentucky and the gentleman from Minnesota each will control 30 minutes.

Gilman: Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3673, the Veterans' Compensation and Readjustment Benefits Amendments, and I commend the gentleman from Arizona [Mr. Stump], the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, and the distinguished ranking minority member, the gentleman from Mississippi [Mr. Montgomery], for their efforts in bringing these important revisions to the floor. Mr. Speaker, this legislation makes several significant adjustments to veterans' compensation and educational programs and authorizes the American Battle Monuments Commission to enter into arrangements for the repair and long-term maintenance of our war memorials. Mr. Speaker, among the compensation benefits provisions is a provision adding bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma to the list of service- connected illnesses presumed to manifest in a radiation-exposed veteran. Those veterans who were exposed to radiation and have subsequently contracted this condition will now be eligible for benefits. The legislation also provides an important presumption of permanent and total disability for veterans over the age of 65 who are nursing home patients, thus making the rating procedure for eligibility determination unnecessary. Moreover, it also authorizes the VA to establish a pilot program to allow contract physicians to provide disability examinations to applicants for disability benefits. It is hoped this program will speed up the disability examination process for claims adjudication. In terms of education benefits, this bill permits veterans who receive training under cooperative programs to be paid full-time education benefits, instead of the current rate of 80 percent. It also allows veterans the opportunity to pursue educational programs through open-circuit television. Finally, H.R. 3673 facilitates the repair and long-term maintenance of overseas war memorials by authorizing the American Battle Monuments Commission to collect private donations and establish a fund to cover maintenance expenses, in addition to relying solely on appropriated funds. The burial benefits program is also amended to extend eligibility to veterans who die in either a State home, or an institution receiving hospital care, nursing home care, or nursing home care payment, providing for payment of transportation expenses and up to $300 in burial costs. Mr. Speaker, this bill makes a number of timely, needed adjustments to our veterans benefits programs. I thank our Committee on Veterans' Affair's for bringing it to the floor and I strongly support passage of this measure.","word.count":377,"sep11":-5.28932584269663,"years":1996.5702247191,"days":559,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0820377288721011,"Topic 2":0.0289157561751463,"Topic 3":0.00881586228812062,"Topic 4":0.00802385322071687,"Topic 5":0.440878337097646,"Topic 6":0.00321329111984739,"Topic 7":0.113416364540607,"Topic 8":0.0430701754039314,"Topic 9":0.221573318686928,"Topic 10":0.0500553125949548},{"id":"10920050004013","body":"Mark Foley: Madam Speaker, the confusing and complicated Republican prescription drug plan will penalize seniors forever if they do not pick a plan by May 15. Unless the administration or Congress acts, 2 months from today, seniors will face a Bush prescription drug tax that will be added to their prescription drug premiums. We simply cannot allow this tax to take effect. President Bush was in New York this week conceding a lot of problems with the drug plan so far. However, the President refuses to extend the deadline for seniors to sign up. If he doesn't change his mind, Congress must act. Seniors are only looking for help for these skyrocketing prescription drug prices. They didn't ask for this confusing drug plan, nor is it to help them. But they need the help. This is both a critical health and financial decision for seniors who rely on prescription drugs to be healthier. Democrats have a plan that would extend the drug enrollment period and eliminate penalties to the end of this year. It is time for us to join together and save American seniors a prescription drug tax that they cannot afford and simply do not deserve.","word.count":219,"sep11":3.58426966292135,"years":2005.44382022472,"days":3718,"party":"Republican","chamber":"H","Topic 1":0.0181985729917299,"Topic 2":0.387127733985635,"Topic 3":0.0257277959222923,"Topic 4":0.0632307722301946,"Topic 5":0.0273346394389547,"Topic 6":0.00488005518245649,"Topic 7":0.411991020814711,"Topic 8":0.0095786170995263,"Topic 9":0.0465400721359037,"Topic 10":0.00539072019859539},{"id":"10419950126544","body":"Thad Cochran: Mr. President, we were successful in getting Senators to cooperate in identifying the amendments that remain to be offered to this bill.
